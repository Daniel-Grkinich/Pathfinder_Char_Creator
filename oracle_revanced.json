You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action).",

      "Planar Infusion (Su)": "As a standard action once per day, you can cause a 20-foot-spread to gain either the mildly chaotic-aligned or mildly evil-aligned planar trait for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Lawful creatures in a chaotic-aligned area take a –2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks, as do good creatures in an evil-aligned area. At 11th level, the infusion makes the area strongly aligned, which causes the –2 circumstance penalty to apply on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks made by any creature that lacks the matching alignment component (these penalties stack with those from the lower-level effect). You must be chaotic or evil to select this revelation, and you can only infuse an area with an alignment that matches a component of your own alignment.",
      "Rift Magic (Su)": "Your spells gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome the spell resistance of chaotic outsiders and evil outsiders.",
      "Rift Weapon (Su)": "Your understanding of the powers that move through the Outer Rifts allows you to imbue weapons with the ability to penetrate the defenses of creatures native to other planes. Once per day as a standard action, you can touch one weapon (or a group of up to 20 similar pieces of ammunition) and give it the ability to penetrate DR/cold iron for 1 minute per caster level. At 9th level, you can also grant the additional ability to bypass either DR/good and DR/law. You can use this ability an additional time per day for every 5 oracle levels you possess.",
      "Telepathy (Su)": "You can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language, as per the telepathy power of demons and angels. You must be at least 11th level before selecting this revelation.",
      "Unearthly Terrain (Su)": "You can twist the material world into the harsh, jagged edges and uneven angles of the outer planes. As a standard action, you can turn one 20-foot square into difficult terrain for 1 round per level. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.",
      "Wings of Terror (Su)": "You can manifest a pair of enormous, batlike demon wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability and a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. At 10th level, your speed increases to 90 feet, your maneuverability increases to good, and the bonus increases to +8 on Intimidate checks. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",

These have a spell level equal to their sorcerer/wizard spell level.

At 14th level, this ability functions as shadow body instead, except you also gain DR 10/magic and become immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits as if also using gaseous form. You can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

The first time you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature can attempt a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, while success means the creature takes only 1 point of damage from the weapon’s attacks. The weapon deals only 1 point of damage to objects. At 3rd level, and again at 11th level and 19th level, the weapon gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus. At 7th level, the weapon gains either the frost or keen weapon special ability, chosen when the weapon is created. These abilities don’t function against a target that succeeds at its Will save. At 15th level, the weapon deals minimum damage (as if it had rolled a 1 on each of its damage dice) against targets that succeed at their saves instead of 1 point of damage. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp.",

      "Shadow Projection (Su)": "You infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, causing it to separate from your body and act as an independent creature. This ability functions as shadow projection except as follows. Your shadow has the outsider type and the phantom subtype instead of the undead type. As a result, this ability does not have the evil descriptor and your shadow cannot be turned or affected as undead (though it can be affected as an outsider). You can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half your oracle level. These hours don’t need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments. Your shadow’s hit points are not replenished between uses, although your shadow can be healed in the same manner as any other outsider. When this ability isn’t in use, any healing done to you also heals your shadow for an equal amount. You must be at least 7th level to choose this revelation.",

At 11th level, you can use these wings to fly as if with overland flight once per day.

      "Eldritch Scar (Su)": "Once per day when you damage a creature with a spell you cast, you may, as a swift action, cause your magic to leave an eldritch scar upon that creature. An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a primal magic event (see Sample Primal Magic Events below) of a CR equal to your caster level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse’s level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event—an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",

      "Primal Manipulation (Su)": "Whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you may change it to deal one of the other listed damage types. You may use this ability once per day, plus one additional time for every 5 levels. At 15th level, you can change a spell to deal sonic damage, though the damage is halved. At 20th level, you can change a spell to deal force damage, though the damage is halved. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
      "Primal Mastery (Su)": "Whenever a spell you cast triggers a primal magic event, or whenever you use a rod of wonder, roll d% twice when generating the result. You may pick which of the two results actually occurs. You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist primal magic events or magical effects caused by a rod of wonder.",
      "Trigger Primal Magic Event (Su)": "Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause a spellcaster (including yourself ) within 30 feet to trigger a primal magic event as the spell is being cast. At 13th level, you can cause any creature in the act of activating a magic item to trigger a primal magic event (see Sample Primal Magic Events below). At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. A spellcaster can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell’s level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect, but non-spellcasters activating magic items have no such option. You must be at least 9th level before selecting this revelation.",

You do not provoke an attack of opportunity as normal for this trip attempt. You cannot be tripped in return when using this ability.",
      "Crystal Sight (Ex)": "You can see through stone, earth, or sand as easily as if it were transparent crystal. Your gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to your oracle level, or 1/12th this thickness of metal.

      "Earth Glide (Su)": "You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a free action. You can glide for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can bring other creatures with you when you glide, but each passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.",
      "Mighty Pebble (Su)": "As a standard action, you can charge and throw a pebble (or other stone of similar size) that detonates when it strikes a target as a ranged attack. The pebble has a range increment of 20 feet and has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage for every four oracle levels you possess. Any creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum 1d6). Creatures in squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or no damage if they make a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses, treat the pebble as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",
      "Rock Throwing (Ex)": "You are an accomplished rock thrower and have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown rocks. You can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than your own size.

      "Shard Explosion (Su)": "As a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the broken shards make the area difficult terrain until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",
      "Steelbreaker Skin (Su)": "As a standard action, you can harden your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed. Anytime a melee or ranged weapon strikes you, the weapon takes an amount of damage equal to your oracle level. This ability does not prevent the weapon from harming you unless the damage destroys the weapon attacking you. You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 minute/level.

At 5th level, you gain Improved Trip as a bonus feat. At 10th level, you gain Greater Trip as a bonus feat. You do not need to meet the prerequisites to gain these feats.",
      "Touch of Acid (Su)": "As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of acid damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield deals +1d6 points of acid damage, similar to how a flaming weapon operates.",

Whenever the target would roll to deal damage with an attack or spell, it deals the minimum amount of damage. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 11th level and 15th level.

      "Enhanced Inflictions (Su)": "You recognize that harming your enemies is sometimes the only way to help your allies, and so your wrath is particularly fierce. Whenever you cast an inflict spell (a spell with the word “inflict” in the name), the maximum amount of damage dealt by the spell is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell.

This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 5 oracle levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). It doesn’t stack with other feats or class features that improve the bonus you provide when using the aid another action. This revelation also counts as the Combat Expertise feat, but only for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Swift Aid feat and any feat that lists Swift Aid as a prerequisite.",

While this ability is in effect, the target is never considered to be threatening you or your allies, even if it is armed and you or your allies are standing in a square into which it can make a melee attack. If the target rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 7th and 15th levels.",
      "Shell of Succor (Su)": "You can surround an ally with bolstering energies that supplement its health and grant it extra vigor. With a touch from you (a standard action), one creature gains a ward of restorative energy, granting it a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma bonus + 1d6 per 2 oracle levels you have (maximum 10d6). These temporary hit points last 1 minute per oracle level you have. The target always loses these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points (including those from, for example, the purify body spell on page 9 or a kineticist’s force ward defense wild talent). If an attack deals fewer points of damage than the target has as temporary hit points from shell of succor, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss.

Against objects or constructs, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per oracle level. If used against an object in another creature’s possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver.

The target creature must make a Fortitude save or vanish completely for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1 round). No magic or divinations can detect the creature during this time, as it exists outside of time and space—in effect, the creature ceases to exist for the duration of this ability.

At 7th level, the touched creature must also make a Fortitude saving throw or be fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level. This has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
      "Wings of Darkness (Su)": "As a swift action, you can manifest a set of translucent, inky wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 11th level, you can use these wings to fly as if with overland flight once per day.

Chanting after the initial round of the effect is a free action, and you can incorporate verbal components and communication into the chant; magical silence ends a chant and its protection effect.

These morbid spells might expire or be ended by the juju worker after the victim has been judged dead or even buried, creating the appearance of undeath.",
      "Entranced Zombies": "The most baffling form of “juju zombies” are those who live, yet are enslaved to the power of a juju practitioner. Taking on the chalky complexion, shambling gait, and halted vital functions of the undead, these victims only appear dead because of eerie enchantments. Those familiar with juju magic refer to such beings as “laubo.” Although other magic reveals that laubo are not truly undead, the spells or noxious fetishes of a juju user make them appear so as they do their master’s bidding. Such magic fades over time, but often too late for a victim mistaken for the walking dead.",

Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this damage in place of the normal damage for the attack. Once per round, if you pass through a living allied creature’s square or the ally passes through your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1 per oracle level. You may use this ability to heal yourself as a move action. You choose whether or not to heal a creature when it passes through your space. You may return to your normal form as a free action. You may remain in energy body form for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level.",
      "Enhanced Cures (Su)": "Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell.

After successfully attacking with this ability, you can use a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories and then attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim’s skill bonus.

Lawful creatures in a chaotic-aligned area take a –2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks, as do good creatures in an evil-aligned area. At 11th level, the infusion makes the area strongly aligned, which causes the –2 circumstance penalty to apply on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks made by any creature that lacks the matching alignment component (these penalties stack with those from the lower-level effect).

The first time you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature can attempt a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, while success means the creature takes only 1 point of damage from the weapon’s attacks.

An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a primal magic event (see Sample Primal Magic Events below) of a CR equal to your caster level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse’s level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event—an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade.

      "Trigger Primal Magic Event (Su)": "Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause a spellcaster (including yourself ) within 30 feet to trigger a primal magic event as the spell is being cast. At 13th level, you can cause any creature in the act of activating a magic item to trigger a primal magic event (see Sample Primal Magic Events below). At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. A spellcaster can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell’s level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect, but non-spellcasters activating magic items have no such option.

      "Earth Glide (Su)": "You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a free action. You can glide for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can bring other creatures with you when you glide, but each passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.",
      "Mighty Pebble (Su)": "As a standard action, you can charge and throw a pebble (or other stone of similar size) that detonates when it strikes a target as a ranged attack. The pebble has a range increment of 20 feet and has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage for every four oracle levels you possess. Any creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum 1d6). Creatures in squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or no damage if they make a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses, treat the pebble as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands.

You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",
      "Steelbreaker Skin (Su)": "As a standard action, you can harden your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed.

      "Curse of Dampening (Su)": "You diminish one target within 30 feet as a standard action, making its attacks weaker. Whenever the target would roll to deal damage with an attack or spell, it deals the minimum amount of damage. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 11th level and 15th level. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.",
      "Enhanced Cures (Su)": "As per the life oracle mystery revelation of the same name.",
      "Enhanced Inflictions (Su)": "You recognize that harming your enemies is sometimes the only way to help your allies, and so your wrath is particularly fierce. Whenever you cast an inflict spell (a spell with the word “inflict” in the name), the maximum amount of damage dealt by the spell is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of succor with this revelation can cast inflict light wounds to deal 1d8+11 points of damage instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.",

You gain Bodyguard as a bonus feat, and whenever you use the aid another action to provide a bonus on attack rolls or to AC to one of your allies, the bonus you provide increases by 1. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 5 oracle levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). It doesn’t stack with other feats or class features that improve the bonus you provide when using the aid another action. This revelation also counts as the Combat Expertise feat, but only for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Swift Aid feat and any feat that lists Swift Aid as a prerequisite.",
      "Pitiful Foe (Su)": "You can temporarily curse one target within 30 feet as a standard action, making it pitiful and ineffective in battle. While this ability is in effect, the target is never considered to be threatening you or your allies, even if it is armed and you or your allies are standing in a square into which it can make a melee attack. If the target rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 7th and 15th levels.",
      "Shell of Succor (Su)": "You can surround an ally with bolstering energies that supplement its health and grant it extra vigor. With a touch from you (a standard action), one creature gains a ward of restorative energy, granting it a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma bonus + 1d6 per 2 oracle levels you have (maximum 10d6). These temporary hit points last 1 minute per oracle level you have. The target always loses these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points (including those from, for example, the purify body spell on page 9 or a kineticist’s force ward defense wild talent). If an attack deals fewer points of damage than the target has as temporary hit points from shell of succor, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 11th and 19th levels. You must be at least 3rd level before selecting this revelation.",

This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1). You can confer the benefits of a teamwork feat you have a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",

Against objects or constructs, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per oracle level. If used against an object in another creature’s possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every five oracle levels you possess.",
      "Erase from Time (Su)": "As a melee touch attack, you can temporarily remove a creature from time altogether. The target creature must make a Fortitude save or vanish completely for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1 round). No magic or divinations can detect the creature during this time, as it exists outside of time and space—in effect, the creature ceases to exist for the duration of this ability. At the end of the duration, the creature reappears unharmed in the space it last occupied (or the nearest possible space, if the original space is now occupied). You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level.",

      "Temporal Celerity (Su)": "Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll twice and take either result. At 7th level, you can always act in the surprise round, but if you fail to notice the ambush, you act last, regardless of your initiative result (you act in the normal order in following rounds). At 11th level, you can roll for initiative three times and take any one of the results.",
      "Time Flicker (Su)": "As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining concealment (as the blur spell). You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as the blink spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal time flicker duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.",

The cloud is stationary, and remains for 1 round per oracle level. Using this ability again causes your previous cloud to fall to the ground. At 7th level, your ash cloud fills with embers.

The fire lasts for 1d4 rounds, but it can be extinguished as a move action if the creature succeeds at a Reflex save (using the original spell’s DC). Dousing the creature with water as a standard action grants a +2 bonus on this save, while immersing the creature in water extinguishes the fire. Spells that don’t grant a saving throw don’t cause a creature to catch on fire.",
      "Cleansing Flames (Su)": "As a swift action, you can take 1d4 points of damage per oracle level to gain a new saving throw against a single ongoing effect.

At 7th level, while this ability is in effect, you can instead go underwater, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe water.
