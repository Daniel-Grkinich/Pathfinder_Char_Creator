This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes. : Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell's save DC by 1.  The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation's residents. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you're using spells that require an attack roll (such as or ) or spells that allow a save (such as or ). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.  Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal. Any exposure to or experimentation with primal magics may introduce primal dragon blood into a lineage. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to half the spell's level.\"\n",

This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes. : Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell's save DC by 1.  The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation's residents. : Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you're using spells that require an attack roll (such as chill touch or scorching ray) or spells that allow a save (such as fireball or lightning bolt). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.  Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal.
