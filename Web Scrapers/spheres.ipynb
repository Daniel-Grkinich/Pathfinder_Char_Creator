      "    \"benefits\": \"If you have a secured rope, a set piton, thrown a grappling hook, or wrapped a whip or similar weapon around a point, you may use the attached rope or weapon to spring around the battlefield. There are five methods for securing a rope: Flail Group Weapon:  Weapons from the flails weapon group may be used as if they were a grappling hook, though applying them requires a melee attack roll rather than a ranged attack roll. A length of rope may be used in this way also, taking improvised weapon penalties as appropriate. Grappling Hook:  You may throw a held grappling hook as a swift action, making a grapple check against a creature or a ranged attack roll against an unattended object. This deals no damage. You may use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier on this grapple check. A creature may remove a grappling hook as a move action with a Strength or Escape Artist check against this sphere's DC or a grapple check against your grapple CMD. The range increment of a grappling hook is improved to 20 ft. Grappling Weapon:  If you are grappling a creature via the grappling special feature of a weapon, a rope attached to that weapon counts as secure for the duration of the grapple. Piton:  You may draw a piton and rope and attempt to set it in an object or creature within reach as a standard action, dealing 1d4 + Strength modifier damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must succeed on a melee attack to place the piton on a creature. A creature can remove a set piton as a move action with a Strength check equal to this sphere's DC. If you fail to deal damage, your attempt fails. Tie:  You also may simply secure a rope to a suitable point within reach (a pillar, post, chandelier, etc.) as a standard action. Any creature within reach may untie this rope as a standard action. Once your rope is secured by any of the above methods, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the rope or weapon's reach (as determined from the anchor point), to a maximum of 30 ft. without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by making a Climb check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. Use your reach (not threatened area) to determine the maximum movement length when using a weapon from the flail group for this ability. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. You may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling if you succeed on a Climb check against the surface's DC. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or creatures, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the rope's reach). You must have a free hand to use this ability. Movement using this ability counts as climbing for the purpose of the (climb) package's movement bonuses. For every 4 ranks in Climb you possess, you may move an additional 5 ft. with this talent. If you possess the Mobile Striker talent, you may replace the movement portion of that talent with the movement granted by this talent. Ropes or weapons affixed to creatures by any method above allow both the creature to which the rope is affixed (the target) and the creature holding the rope or weapon (the holder) to attempt drag and reposition combat maneuvers against each other. The holder may always choose to drop the rope or weapon as a free action on his turn or as an immediate action off-turn. Example: Azeem the conscript is facing a force of kobolds in a tunnel. Two of them, wielding clubs, have moved adjacent to attack him, while two more are behind a barricade 30 ft. down the tunnel with crossbows. Jorr draws (a move action) and throws (a swift action) his grappling hook to attach it to the overhead scaffolding 25 ft. away, then attempts to swing to just behind the crossbow-wielding kobolds to a space 35 ft. from his current position, 10 ft. beyond the anchor point. Jorr must make a Climb check and compare it to the CMDs of all four kobolds, since two are adjacent to his starting position and two adjacent to his ending position. If he succeeds, he moves without provoking attacks of opportunity, springing over the heads of the nearby kobolds, swinging over the barricade and kicking off the tunnel wall to land beyond the far foe. Errata:  Releasing or unsecuring a rope after a swing is a free action. ( Source )\"\n",

For every size the creature is larger than you, you gain a +3 bonus on your Climb check against that creature. You can climb with only one hand as part of using this ability, but you must have at least one hand free. While you are on a creature, you move with it whenever it moves. For every size larger that the creature is than you, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks against you. The creature is also flat-footed against your attacks. You may climb down the creature to an unoccupied adjacent square as a swift action, taking no damage, or jump off as a free action that can be taken even when it's not your turn, taking falling damage as appropriate to the creature's height. The creature may make a combat maneuver check against your CMD to dislodge you, causing you to fall into an adjacent square; you may substitute your Climb skill modifier + 10 in place of your CMD for this check (this includes the +3 bonus per size category). If the creature spends a full-round action to drop prone and roll, it gains a +10 bonus on this check and you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each size category larger than you the creature is unless you choose to jump off. If you are grappled by a creature while scaling a different creature, if the scaled creature leaves the reach of the grappling creature, the grapple ends instantly. If you are subject to an effect originating from another creature that would move you while scaling an enemy and you are moved so that the scaled creature is no longer within your natural reach, this ability ends instantly. If the target creature is impaled per the impale ability of the Lancer sphere, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to CMD against grapple checks made by the target to remove you and count any hand being used to control the weapon used to impale the target as being used for the climb check. If you possess the (leap) package, you may make the required Climb check as part of any jump that would carry you through a space that would put the target within your reach.

This requires 8 hours and a creature of the animal type that has an attitude toward you of indifferent or better. This time may be divided as per the magic item crafting rules. You may only train one creature at a time with this ability. At the end of this period, make a Handle Animal check with a DC of 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. If successful, the creature is now considered tame. You may not tame a creature with more Hit Dice than you have ranks in Handle Animal. You may have multiple tame creatures under your control, but their total Hit Dice cannot exceed your ranks in Handle Animal. If you attempt to tame a creature that would exceed your Hit Dice cap, you must choose which other creatures to release. Animal companions and familiars, such as from class features, the Animal Companion talent, or the Pet talent, never count against this Hit Dice cap. You may not use this ability on a creature with the swarm subtype. A creature with a template adds the challenge rating adjustment of the template to its HD (minimum increase +0) for determining if you may tame it and for how many creatures you can have tame. Variant creatures with increased challenge ratings (such as a pyrohydra compared to a normal hydra, if using the Broad Skills talent), treats the challenge rating increase of the variant as if it were a template for this purpose. A creature whose permanent Intelligence score is raised above 2 is no longer a valid target for this ability and is automatically released. This effect ends if you go two full days without spending at least 1 hour training your tame creatures.

An improved companion chosen using this talent advances the same way as detailed in the ability that grants you access to your animal companion or mount (such as a druid's animal companion, cavalier's mount, paladin's divine bond, or the Beastmastery sphere Animal Companion talent). You can also dismiss an improved companion, as dictated by your class feature. Subject to GM discretion, other special creatures can be made available with this feat.

For example, to select a behir available through the Beast Speaker feat, you must have 7 ranks in either Diplomacy or Intimidate and 7 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). An improved companion chosen with this talent gains additional abilities and bonuses listed in the mastery entry in its stat block when your effective druid level is equal to or higher than that companion's indicated mastery level.

You may use Handle Animal to teach an animal a unique trick: Civilized (DC 20):  The companion can commingle with humanoid society, and is able to behave autonomously and appropriately in complex social situations, such as bowing to a monarch when appropriate, attending a dinner party, or generally behaving like a polite person in any given scenario. This is not intelligence, it is simply learned mannerisms that conveniently allow an animal to react to both simple and complex social situations, and react appropriately to questions and conversations as though it understood languages the handler possessed at the time they taught the animal this trick. In addition, when attempting a Disguise check to alter an animal's appearance, the Disguise check takes no penalties due to different gender, race, age, or size category. Disguising an animal in this way may be as simple as putting a hat on a bear to applying full makeup and costumery to a salamander. An animal disguised this way does not automatically draw attention to itself, though it may draw suspicion if it does not behave appropriately to a situation. You may substitute your Handle Animal bonus in place of your Disguise bonus when attempting this check. Example:  A bear disguised as a human noble and taught the Civilized trick could attend a nobleman's dinner party, not draw suspicion to itself while disguised as a noble, and even engage in basic social etiquette.\"\n",

      "    \"benefits\": \"Prerequisites:  Beastmastery sphere, Handle Animal 5 ranks. You may speak with animals. You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but this ability doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Adjusted Companion Base Attack Bonus Reasoning:  Animal companions begin to struggle at high levels of play due to having 3/4 base attack bonus compared to a Conjuration sphere or Leadership sphere companion's full base attack bonus. GMs may find it appropriate to adjust the scaling of animal companions by implementing this variant rule. Rule:  An animal companion's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Beastmastery and Taming Intelligent Creatures As a variant-rule to the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery legendary talent, GMs may allow characters to \\\"tame\\\" other intelligent creatures to aid and assist them as companions. This optional variant rule should be treated the same as a legendary talent. It is powerful and potentially world altering and should be handled with care and allowed with supervision. Rule:  Characters with the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery (handle animal) legendary talent may tame creatures of any type and of any intelligence. GMs have ultimate control over what creatures are appropriate to be tamed. Intelligent creatures tamed this way are recruited similarly to a Leadership sphere cohort, attempting a Handle Animal check against a base DC of 10 + the Hit Dice of the creature you are looking to tame. This check is not modified by Settlement Size Modifiers or Miscellaneous Modifiers but can be modified by circumstantial elements by GM discretion. Context and Reasoning:  A primary pillar of balance for the Beastmastery sphere is that it is not the Leadership feat or the Leadership sphere. The Beastmastery sphere is limited to taming and handling creatures with \\\"animal intelligence\\\" (2 Intelligence or less). This is because a creature with 3 Intelligence or greater is considered sapient, rather than just sentient. A sapient creature is one capable of complex thoughts, expressions, and actions. Put simply, intelligent creatures are intelligent. As of this handbook, the only way to recruit another fully-intelligent creature as a companion is through the Leadership sphere Advanced Cohorts (cohort) legendary talent, which is the same talent used to recruit \\\"people\\\", or otherwise recapture the original strength of the Leadership feat. While this is a valid option for those looking to recruit outsiders and other adventurers, or realistically anything you come across, it often comes as a disconnect that the Beastmastery sphere cannot gain magical creatures as companions, such as a talented beastmaster coming across a noble unicorn but being unable to recruit or convince them to join them any better than another character. This sphere-specific variant rule functions primarily as an adjustment to the Mindless Mastery legendary talent as the \\\"capstone\\\" of being a tamer, allowing a Beastmastery practitioner to \\\"tame\\\" any creature. This only functions as the handle animal package's tame ability for counting the tamed creature's Hit Dice against the total number of Hit Dice a character may control and differs in nearly every other aspect. When allowing intelligent creatures to be tamed through Beastmastery, GM's should be aware of and consider the following: What Is Tameable:  Only \\\"reasonably creature-like\\\" creatures should be tameable. This variant rule is not meant to replace Leadership sphere and should not be used to tame humanoid, monstrous humanoid, humanoid-like outsiders and other highly intelligent and autonomous creatures. The main purpose is to allow someone to befriend a unicorn, or raise an owlbear or dragon hatchling, not recruit a retinue of robots. Intelligent creatures fall into three categories of \\\"tameability\\\":\\n \\n 1. \\\"Magical Creatures\\\":  Griffon, unicorns, behirs and other magical beasts are generally appropriate to be tamed with this variant rule. \\n 2. \\\"Unusual Creatures\\\":  Things like feral aberrations, wyverns, hatchling dragons, sentient oozes, plants, and vermin are usually appropriate, but depend on the circumstances and rely more heavily on GM permission. \\n 3. \\\"Inappropriate Creatures\\\":  Adult dragons, outsiders, golems, humanoids (humans, trolls, etc.) and other creatures that have either incredibly powerful abilities or have human-like capacity should almost never be appropriate, although exceptions can be made by a GM, such as a powerful paladin recruiting a dragon to their cause. Other players are not appropriate, as are townsfolk and other \\\"people\\\". Ultimately, the GM has final say over what can be recruited as an animal ally. \\n \\n \\n Willing and Non-Hostile:  A tamed intelligent creature is not compelled to assist and does so out of their free will and their relationship with the character. Creatures have their own motivations, goals, needs, and morality and can never be forced to do something self-destructive or against their nature. This extends to the Beast Tamer legendary talent. An intelligent creature can never be forcibly conscripted unless it would be willing to in the first place. Likewise, the creature should not be hostile to the character or have competing goals. Attempting to tame an actively hostile mimic or a rampaging bulette should not be possible. Likewise, attempting to tame the evil dragon serving as the \\\"BBEG\\\" of the story should not be possible. A creature must be willing to help and follow the character. \\n \\\"Tamed\\\":  A tamed intelligent creature is treated as an animal ally when appropriate but is interacted with and treated as a companion in the ordinary sense of the word. When spending at least 1 hour with your tamed creatures, a character does not need to re-tame them or interact with them the same way they would a tamed wolf or hydra. Spending time with a tamed intelligent creature can be as simple as checking up on them, sharing a meal, and interacting with them as if they were a normal NPC. If something would assert competing non-magical influence over the creature, such as trying to convince them to join them, it is the creature's choice as a function of roleplay, motivations, and desires. Magical compulsion effects, however, are treated as a competing effect and allow a tamed intelligent creature to resist as appropriate. \\n Unequal Partnerships:  Not every Beastmastery practitioner will be looking to form a compassionate, fair bond with others. In establishing this variant rule, it is important to not treat the tame ability as a form of servitude or slavery. However, some characters, particularly evil ones, may want to roleplay these interactions as the \\\"overlord\\\" or \\\"master\\\" of a so-called lesser creature. It is not the goal of this variant rule to make gameplay uncomfortable for others, or inappropriate, so it is important for players and their GM to discuss how they want this ability to be treated. Some may prefer the equal companionship aspect whereas others may want to treat it as servitude. These choices are all respective and contingent on the previous considerations listed with this variant rule. Where one character may want to form a bond with a wise, ancient owlbear of the woods, another may be playing an antipaladin and want to tempt a noble unicorn to fall to darkness. Both of these choices are perfectly valid, but it should be a goal to not execute this variant rule in a way that it makes others uncomfortable. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Improved Familiars and Familiar Archetypes Reasoning:  As Pathfinder developed, familiar archetypes became a fun and interesting way to customize your familiars and how you interact with them and what benefits you gain from them. Improved Familiars have always lost their ability to speak with other creatures of their kind because most improved familiar options can already talk or understand languages. GMs may find it appropriate to remove this change and allow improved familiars with familiar archetypes. This will often be an upgrade over a normal improved familiar but will not offer any unusual increases in power that would not be otherwise available. Rule:  The Improved Familiar feat and Improved Pet legendary talent do not remove a familiar's ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Improved familiars may take familiar archetypes that would remove the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Multiple Animal Companions and Alternatives Reasoning:  Through various means, characters may gain separate class features which independently grant animal companions or mounts, granting them in such a way that the character receives multiple, full-progression animal companions. Multiple animal companions can happen when an animal companion class feature is granted with restrictions, such as a lion shaman druid's restriction to lion animal companions also gaining access to the mount class feature. Restricting the druid to rideable creatures only would grant to separate companions as the effective druid levels for both companions could not combine. While as written this works, GMs should review whether they want a character to have control of multiple companions and consider how that may affect the flow of combat and gameplay. Players, on the other hand, should consider whether they actually want multiple companions, or if they do not want the extra resources and stat blocks to manage. Rule:  By GM permission, three potential solutions to the issue of multiple animal companions: 1: Improved Bond:  By forgoing one of the additional companions, the character chooses one teamwork feat he qualifies for. Both the character and his companion gain this teamwork feat; the companion may use and benefit from this teamwork feat even if it would not normally meet the prerequisites. This teamwork feat can be rechosen after 8 hours of rest. \\n 2: Refund:  \\\"Refund\\\" the character's class feature granting the extra companion by granting them one or two bonus Beastmastery sphere talents when they would gain the second companion. For example, a sacred huntsmaster inqiusitor choosing the chivalry domain could gain a bonus Beastmastery sphere talent or other thematically appropriate talent as a substitute to the extra horse they would otherwise have. \\n 3: Retraining or Different Choices:  Either through retraining or GM permission, the character may reselect one of their companion-granting abilities, retraining it to a different and more appropriate option.

Planar Power Components Whether excavated, purified, or procured through other means, distant worlds and strange planes are often the home of new materials, many of which are useful for magic. Alchemical power components were first introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory and planar power components were introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Plane-Hopper's Handbook. Planar power components are treated as alchemical reagents which amplify magical effects. The Realmwalker's Handbook introduces a number of new planar power components which can be used for either classic spellcasting or spherecasting. Planar power components function similarly to alchemical reagents, with a few notable alterations. A planar power component can be used as a consumable, additional material component or as a reusable focus when casting a spell or sphere effect, as though the caster were using the Material Casting or Focus Casting general casting drawbacks. Using a planar power component does not increase a spell or sphere effect's casting time, even if it would add a metamagic feat's effects. A planar power component's effects do not stack with either themselves or one another. As such, only a single planar power component can be included when casting a spell or sphere effect. Each planar power component notes the type of spells and sphere effects it is usable with, the number required when used as a material component (noted as \\\"doses\\\") or as an additional focus (noted as \\\"focus\\\"), and the effects of the component when used. Planar Component Foci as Crafted Equipment: \\nWhen a caster makes frequent use of planar power components as foci for their magics, it is common for to affix or craft the components into a held, slotted, or otherwise worn item, such as lining the head of a caster's staff or creating a simple broach or ring, to be used as the focus. Integrating a planar power component into an item does not cost any additional gold or resources (beyond the base item) and requires a number of doses of the planar power component sufficient to be used as a focus. If the resulting item is heavily composed of or incorporates the component in a more permanent manner, such as crafting the base of an amulet out of the material rather than just socketing it or reforging a sword's hilt out of the material, it may require a craftsman to safely craft the item, usually with a DC 15 Craft check of the appropriate kind and a few hours. The same check may be made to safely remove the components from the item, reclaiming the power components without destroying or harming the original item. There is no penalty for a failed check.\"\n",

      "    \"benefits\": \"You channel the serpent, improving your tenacity and grip. You gain the following abilities which can be used while grappling: When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:  While you are grappling another creature, any effect which would move your grappled target out of your reach must also succeed against you and your relevant statistic (CMD, saving throw, ability check, etc.) or fail to move the grappled target. When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:  If an effect would move you away from your grappled target, you may attempt a grapple combat maneuver against your grappled target's CMD as an immediate action. If the target is battered, you may spend an attack of opportunity in place of an immediate action instead. If you are successful, the grappled target is moved into the nearest unoccupied and safe space within your reach and remains grappled. A grappled target being moved this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If there is no unoccupied, safe space within your reach when attempting to move your grappled target with you, the target is moved into the nearest unoccupied, safe space near your new location, is released from your grapple, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier (minimum 1 round). Special:  The abilities granted by Stubborn Serpent's Coils do not function against Warp sphere effects or other teleportation effects. If you possess the Inescapable Grasp talent, you may use the abilities granted by this talent against teleportation or Warp effects originating from a source other than your grappled target which would move your grappled target out of your grapple. When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:  You are granted a saving throw or other appropriate check to negate a teleportation effect which would move your grappled target out of your grapple, as described in this ability. \\n When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:  You may include your grappled target in a teleport effect that would move you. If your grappled target is unwilling, the teleportation effect must be able to target an unwilling creature and the creature receives a saving throw against the effect, otherwise the grappled target is not moved with you and your grapple ends. Examples:  Grappling is a complex and often confusing combat maneuver. Two examples are included with this talent to help better demonstrate how this talent is used. If your grappled target is being moved away from you:  A creature which uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push your grappled target away from you must also succeed against your CMD while grappling. A Wind severity effect would fail to push your grappled target if the Wind severity effect fails to push you. If a Telekinesis sphere effect would attempt to lift and move your grappled target out of your reach, the Telekinesis sphere caster would treat this as contested control over an item. If you are being moved away from your grappled target:  If a creature uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push you away from your grappled target, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver as an immediate action (or as an attack of opportunity if the target is battered) against your grappled target. If you are successful, the grappled target also moves into an unoccupied, safe space within your reach and your grapple would not end.\"\n",

Cherry bombs are a splash weapon you can use as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage + 1d4 per 3 Craft (alchemy) ranks you possess to the target of a direct hit, and 1 point of bludgeoning splash damage per die of damage this weapon deals on a direct hit to targets 5 feet away from the point of contact (to a maximum of half the damage dealt to the primary target). An individual cherry bomb cannot be split apart from its cluster for more than 1 round without becoming inert. An individual cherry bomb may be modified (such as by being placed into a vial arrow) without being split from its cluster. An entire cluster of cherry bombs is required to make a coating if used with the Chemical Coating talent. If you can create formulae that inflict different types of damage (such as an alchemist's fire dealing fire damage) when you create the cherry bombs you may have it deal that kind of damage instead. The damage can only be of one damage type at a time, but each separate bomb can deal a different type of damage. You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each time you do so, the Reflex save DC to avoid the splash damage increases by +1.\"\n",

This bonus increases by 1 per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy) that you possess. Sobering Schnapps:  You create the perfect concoction; an alcoholic drink that wears away at hangovers. Creatures that drink this alcohol ignore the penalties for being drunk (and bonuses, if any) for 1 hour, and reduce the penalties from the sickened condition by half. Once you have 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), the sickened condition is instead cured automatically, and creatures are immune to it for the duration. Vitalizing Vodka:  Creatures that drink this alcohol gain 1d4 temporary hit points for one hour. The amount of temporary hit points granted increases by 1d4 per 3 ranks in Craft (alchemy) that you possess. Wakeful Whisky:  Creatures that drink this alcohol can remain awake for eight hours without feeling sleepy, granting them a +2 circumstance bonus against sleep effects. A creature can drink this drink to avoid needing to rest, but any vigorous activity such as fighting, traveling or similar ends the effect, and creatures must drink another or sleep for the remaining hours to avoid fatigue and to gain the benefits of a full night's rest. The bonus increases by 1 per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy) that you possess. A creature can only benefit from one drink at a time, although a single drink may have multiple alcohol types mixed together by raising the Craft DC. You can increase the Craft DC of this formulae when creating a set of drinks in increments of 10 to apply the effects of an additional alcohol type for each increment to the set of drinks, allowing a creature to benefit from multiple alcohol types at the same time from those drinks.\"\n",

A philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use.

      "            \"benefits\": \"If you have a secured rope, a set piton, thrown a grappling hook, or wrapped a whip or similar weapon around a point, you may use the attached rope or weapon to spring around the battlefield. There are five methods for securing a rope: Flail Group Weapon:  Weapons from the flails weapon group may be used as if they were a grappling hook, though applying them requires a melee attack roll rather than a ranged attack roll. A length of rope may be used in this way also, taking improvised weapon penalties as appropriate. Grappling Hook:  You may throw a held grappling hook as a swift action, making a grapple check against a creature or a ranged attack roll against an unattended object. This deals no damage. You may use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier on this grapple check. A creature may remove a grappling hook as a move action with a Strength or Escape Artist check against this sphere's DC or a grapple check against your grapple CMD. The range increment of a grappling hook is improved to 20 ft. Grappling Weapon:  If you are grappling a creature via the grappling special feature of a weapon, a rope attached to that weapon counts as secure for the duration of the grapple. Piton:  You may draw a piton and rope and attempt to set it in an object or creature within reach as a standard action, dealing 1d4 + Strength modifier damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must succeed on a melee attack to place the piton on a creature. A creature can remove a set piton as a move action with a Strength check equal to this sphere's DC. If you fail to deal damage, your attempt fails. Tie:  You also may simply secure a rope to a suitable point within reach (a pillar, post, chandelier, etc.) as a standard action. Any creature within reach may untie this rope as a standard action. Once your rope is secured by any of the above methods, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the rope or weapon's reach (as determined from the anchor point), to a maximum of 30 ft. without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by making a Climb check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. Use your reach (not threatened area) to determine the maximum movement length when using a weapon from the flail group for this ability. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. You may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling if you succeed on a Climb check against the surface's DC. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or creatures, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the rope's reach). You must have a free hand to use this ability. Movement using this ability counts as climbing for the purpose of the (climb) package's movement bonuses. For every 4 ranks in Climb you possess, you may move an additional 5 ft. with this talent. If you possess the Mobile Striker talent, you may replace the movement portion of that talent with the movement granted by this talent. Ropes or weapons affixed to creatures by any method above allow both the creature to which the rope is affixed (the target) and the creature holding the rope or weapon (the holder) to attempt drag and reposition combat maneuvers against each other. The holder may always choose to drop the rope or weapon as a free action on his turn or as an immediate action off-turn. Example: Azeem the conscript is facing a force of kobolds in a tunnel. Two of them, wielding clubs, have moved adjacent to attack him, while two more are behind a barricade 30 ft. down the tunnel with crossbows. Jorr draws (a move action) and throws (a swift action) his grappling hook to attach it to the overhead scaffolding 25 ft. away, then attempts to swing to just behind the crossbow-wielding kobolds to a space 35 ft. from his current position, 10 ft. beyond the anchor point. Jorr must make a Climb check and compare it to the CMDs of all four kobolds, since two are adjacent to his starting position and two adjacent to his ending position. If he succeeds, he moves without provoking attacks of opportunity, springing over the heads of the nearby kobolds, swinging over the barricade and kicking off the tunnel wall to land beyond the far foe. Errata:  Releasing or unsecuring a rope after a swing is a free action. ( Source )\"\n",

For every size the creature is larger than you, you gain a +3 bonus on your Climb check against that creature. You can climb with only one hand as part of using this ability, but you must have at least one hand free. While you are on a creature, you move with it whenever it moves. For every size larger that the creature is than you, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks against you. The creature is also flat-footed against your attacks. You may climb down the creature to an unoccupied adjacent square as a swift action, taking no damage, or jump off as a free action that can be taken even when it's not your turn, taking falling damage as appropriate to the creature's height. The creature may make a combat maneuver check against your CMD to dislodge you, causing you to fall into an adjacent square; you may substitute your Climb skill modifier + 10 in place of your CMD for this check (this includes the +3 bonus per size category). If the creature spends a full-round action to drop prone and roll, it gains a +10 bonus on this check and you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each size category larger than you the creature is unless you choose to jump off. If you are grappled by a creature while scaling a different creature, if the scaled creature leaves the reach of the grappling creature, the grapple ends instantly. If you are subject to an effect originating from another creature that would move you while scaling an enemy and you are moved so that the scaled creature is no longer within your natural reach, this ability ends instantly. If the target creature is impaled per the impale ability of the Lancer sphere, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to CMD against grapple checks made by the target to remove you and count any hand being used to control the weapon used to impale the target as being used for the climb check. If you possess the (leap) package, you may make the required Climb check as part of any jump that would carry you through a space that would put the target within your reach.

This requires 8 hours and a creature of the animal type that has an attitude toward you of indifferent or better. This time may be divided as per the magic item crafting rules. You may only train one creature at a time with this ability. At the end of this period, make a Handle Animal check with a DC of 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. If successful, the creature is now considered tame. You may not tame a creature with more Hit Dice than you have ranks in Handle Animal. You may have multiple tame creatures under your control, but their total Hit Dice cannot exceed your ranks in Handle Animal. If you attempt to tame a creature that would exceed your Hit Dice cap, you must choose which other creatures to release. Animal companions and familiars, such as from class features, the Animal Companion talent, or the Pet talent, never count against this Hit Dice cap.

Benefit:  When selecting your animal companion or mount, you can choose from special creatures to serve as your improved companion, such as creatures from the Beast Speaker feat (Heroes of Golarion), Monstrous Mount feat (Inner Sea Combat), or other similar source. An improved companion chosen using this talent advances the same way as detailed in the ability that grants you access to your animal companion or mount (such as a druid's animal companion, cavalier's mount, paladin's divine bond, or the Beastmastery sphere Animal Companion talent). You can also dismiss an improved companion, as dictated by your class feature. Subject to GM discretion, other special creatures can be made available with this feat. If a chosen improved companion has prerequisites, as described in its entry, you must meet any additional prerequisites to select that improved companion. For example, to select a behir available through the Beast Speaker feat, you must have 7 ranks in either Diplomacy or Intimidate and 7 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). An improved companion chosen with this talent gains additional abilities and bonuses listed in the mastery entry in its stat block when your effective druid level is equal to or higher than that companion's indicated mastery level. If you dismiss an improved companion and gain a new creature of a different type, your effective druid levels may not be a sufficient level to gain that creature's mastery benefits.

You may use Handle Animal to teach an animal a unique trick: Civilized (DC 20):  The companion can commingle with humanoid society, and is able to behave autonomously and appropriately in complex social situations, such as bowing to a monarch when appropriate, attending a dinner party, or generally behaving like a polite person in any given scenario. This is not intelligence, it is simply learned mannerisms that conveniently allow an animal to react to both simple and complex social situations, and react appropriately to questions and conversations as though it understood languages the handler possessed at the time they taught the animal this trick. In addition, when attempting a Disguise check to alter an animal's appearance, the Disguise check takes no penalties due to different gender, race, age, or size category. Disguising an animal in this way may be as simple as putting a hat on a bear to applying full makeup and costumery to a salamander. An animal disguised this way does not automatically draw attention to itself, though it may draw suspicion if it does not behave appropriately to a situation. You may substitute your Handle Animal bonus in place of your Disguise bonus when attempting this check. Example:  A bear disguised as a human noble and taught the Civilized trick could attend a nobleman's dinner party, not draw suspicion to itself while disguised as a noble, and even engage in basic social etiquette.\"\n",

You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but this ability doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Adjusted Companion Base Attack Bonus Reasoning:  Animal companions begin to struggle at high levels of play due to having 3/4 base attack bonus compared to a Conjuration sphere or Leadership sphere companion's full base attack bonus. GMs may find it appropriate to adjust the scaling of animal companions by implementing this variant rule. Rule:  An animal companion's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Beastmastery and Taming Intelligent Creatures As a variant-rule to the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery legendary talent, GMs may allow characters to \\\"tame\\\" other intelligent creatures to aid and assist them as companions. This optional variant rule should be treated the same as a legendary talent. It is powerful and potentially world altering and should be handled with care and allowed with supervision. Rule:  Characters with the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery (handle animal) legendary talent may tame creatures of any type and of any intelligence. GMs have ultimate control over what creatures are appropriate to be tamed. Intelligent creatures tamed this way are recruited similarly to a Leadership sphere cohort, attempting a Handle Animal check against a base DC of 10 + the Hit Dice of the creature you are looking to tame. This check is not modified by Settlement Size Modifiers or Miscellaneous Modifiers but can be modified by circumstantial elements by GM discretion. Context and Reasoning:  A primary pillar of balance for the Beastmastery sphere is that it is not the Leadership feat or the Leadership sphere. The Beastmastery sphere is limited to taming and handling creatures with \\\"animal intelligence\\\" (2 Intelligence or less). This is because a creature with 3 Intelligence or greater is considered sapient, rather than just sentient. A sapient creature is one capable of complex thoughts, expressions, and actions. Put simply, intelligent creatures are intelligent. As of this handbook, the only way to recruit another fully-intelligent creature as a companion is through the Leadership sphere Advanced Cohorts (cohort) legendary talent, which is the same talent used to recruit \\\"people\\\", or otherwise recapture the original strength of the Leadership feat. While this is a valid option for those looking to recruit outsiders and other adventurers, or realistically anything you come across, it often comes as a disconnect that the Beastmastery sphere cannot gain magical creatures as companions, such as a talented beastmaster coming across a noble unicorn but being unable to recruit or convince them to join them any better than another character. This sphere-specific variant rule functions primarily as an adjustment to the Mindless Mastery legendary talent as the \\\"capstone\\\" of being a tamer, allowing a Beastmastery practitioner to \\\"tame\\\" any creature. This only functions as the handle animal package's tame ability for counting the tamed creature's Hit Dice against the total number of Hit Dice a character may control and differs in nearly every other aspect. When allowing intelligent creatures to be tamed through Beastmastery, GM's should be aware of and consider the following: What Is Tameable:  Only \\\"reasonably creature-like\\\" creatures should be tameable. This variant rule is not meant to replace Leadership sphere and should not be used to tame humanoid, monstrous humanoid, humanoid-like outsiders and other highly intelligent and autonomous creatures. The main purpose is to allow someone to befriend a unicorn, or raise an owlbear or dragon hatchling, not recruit a retinue of robots. Intelligent creatures fall into three categories of \\\"tameability\\\":\\n \\n 1. \\\"Magical Creatures\\\":  Griffon, unicorns, behirs and other magical beasts are generally appropriate to be tamed with this variant rule. \\n 2. \\\"Unusual Creatures\\\":  Things like feral aberrations, wyverns, hatchling dragons, sentient oozes, plants, and vermin are usually appropriate, but depend on the circumstances and rely more heavily on GM permission. \\n 3. \\\"Inappropriate Creatures\\\":  Adult dragons, outsiders, golems, humanoids (humans, trolls, etc.) and other creatures that have either incredibly powerful abilities or have human-like capacity should almost never be appropriate, although exceptions can be made by a GM, such as a powerful paladin recruiting a dragon to their cause. Other players are not appropriate, as are townsfolk and other \\\"people\\\". Ultimately, the GM has final say over what can be recruited as an animal ally. \\n \\n \\n Willing and Non-Hostile:  A tamed intelligent creature is not compelled to assist and does so out of their free will and their relationship with the character. Creatures have their own motivations, goals, needs, and morality and can never be forced to do something self-destructive or against their nature. This extends to the Beast Tamer legendary talent. An intelligent creature can never be forcibly conscripted unless it would be willing to in the first place. Likewise, the creature should not be hostile to the character or have competing goals. Attempting to tame an actively hostile mimic or a rampaging bulette should not be possible. Likewise, attempting to tame the evil dragon serving as the \\\"BBEG\\\" of the story should not be possible. A creature must be willing to help and follow the character. \\n \\\"Tamed\\\":  A tamed intelligent creature is treated as an animal ally when appropriate but is interacted with and treated as a companion in the ordinary sense of the word. When spending at least 1 hour with your tamed creatures, a character does not need to re-tame them or interact with them the same way they would a tamed wolf or hydra. Spending time with a tamed intelligent creature can be as simple as checking up on them, sharing a meal, and interacting with them as if they were a normal NPC. If something would assert competing non-magical influence over the creature, such as trying to convince them to join them, it is the creature's choice as a function of roleplay, motivations, and desires. Magical compulsion effects, however, are treated as a competing effect and allow a tamed intelligent creature to resist as appropriate. \\n Unequal Partnerships:  Not every Beastmastery practitioner will be looking to form a compassionate, fair bond with others. In establishing this variant rule, it is important to not treat the tame ability as a form of servitude or slavery. However, some characters, particularly evil ones, may want to roleplay these interactions as the \\\"overlord\\\" or \\\"master\\\" of a so-called lesser creature. It is not the goal of this variant rule to make gameplay uncomfortable for others, or inappropriate, so it is important for players and their GM to discuss how they want this ability to be treated. Some may prefer the equal companionship aspect whereas others may want to treat it as servitude. These choices are all respective and contingent on the previous considerations listed with this variant rule. Where one character may want to form a bond with a wise, ancient owlbear of the woods, another may be playing an antipaladin and want to tempt a noble unicorn to fall to darkness. Both of these choices are perfectly valid, but it should be a goal to not execute this variant rule in a way that it makes others uncomfortable. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Improved Familiars and Familiar Archetypes Reasoning:  As Pathfinder developed, familiar archetypes became a fun and interesting way to customize your familiars and how you interact with them and what benefits you gain from them. Improved Familiars have always lost their ability to speak with other creatures of their kind because most improved familiar options can already talk or understand languages. GMs may find it appropriate to remove this change and allow improved familiars with familiar archetypes. This will often be an upgrade over a normal improved familiar but will not offer any unusual increases in power that would not be otherwise available. Rule:  The Improved Familiar feat and Improved Pet legendary talent do not remove a familiar's ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Improved familiars may take familiar archetypes that would remove the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Multiple Animal Companions and Alternatives Reasoning:  Through various means, characters may gain separate class features which independently grant animal companions or mounts, granting them in such a way that the character receives multiple, full-progression animal companions. Multiple animal companions can happen when an animal companion class feature is granted with restrictions, such as a lion shaman druid's restriction to lion animal companions also gaining access to the mount class feature. Restricting the druid to rideable creatures only would grant to separate companions as the effective druid levels for both companions could not combine. While as written this works, GMs should review whether they want a character to have control of multiple companions and consider how that may affect the flow of combat and gameplay. Players, on the other hand, should consider whether they actually want multiple companions, or if they do not want the extra resources and stat blocks to manage. Rule:  By GM permission, three potential solutions to the issue of multiple animal companions: 1: Improved Bond:  By forgoing one of the additional companions, the character chooses one teamwork feat he qualifies for. Both the character and his companion gain this teamwork feat; the companion may use and benefit from this teamwork feat even if it would not normally meet the prerequisites. This teamwork feat can be rechosen after 8 hours of rest. \\n 2: Refund:  \\\"Refund\\\" the character's class feature granting the extra companion by granting them one or two bonus Beastmastery sphere talents when they would gain the second companion. For example, a sacred huntsmaster inqiusitor choosing the chivalry domain could gain a bonus Beastmastery sphere talent or other thematically appropriate talent as a substitute to the extra horse they would otherwise have. \\n 3: Retraining or Different Choices:  Either through retraining or GM permission, the character may reselect one of their companion-granting abilities, retraining it to a different and more appropriate option.

If you manage to deal more damage than the floor's hardness, you cause a 5 ft. radius, 10 ft. cone, or 15 ft. line (your choice) to become difficult terrain. Radius' increase by 5 ft. per 10 base attack bonus, cones by 5 ft. per 5 base attack bonus, and lines by 10 ft. per 5 base attack bonus. A square can be cleared as a standard action (provoking an attack of opportunity) or repaired with a spell or effect such as the mending spell or the repair ability of the Creation sphere to no longer be difficult terrain. Creatures within the affected area become battered for 1 round. If a creature is already battered, it must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If your attack is enough to destroy the floor, you may activate the Shrapnel talent, if you possess it. If the floor has a set thickness (for example, attacking the floor on a building's second story), destroying the floor eliminates the targeted area, opening a hole.

Example:  While in this stance, you ready a counterpunch and roll an Acrobatics check to jump. With a result of 31, you jump up to 20 feet; this jump does not count against your normal movement, and you could have moved normally before readying the counterpunch and making this jump.

If you so choose, you may use this chunk as a rock for the Rock Toss Equipment talent, or as an improvised weapon. Unsolid surfaces such as loose dirt cannot be broken in this fashion. When using this talent against a large surface such as a stone wall or floor, you rip out a 1 ft. thick slab off of the surface in question.

Ripping a Medium-sized chunk leaves a 5 ft. square hole, while the hole is half as large for each size category smaller, and twice as large for each size category larger. If you rip a hole in the floor, the pit is deep enough that it can potentially trip creatures.

Planar Power Components Whether excavated, purified, or procured through other means, distant worlds and strange planes are often the home of new materials, many of which are useful for magic. Alchemical power components were first introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory and planar power components were introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Plane-Hopper's Handbook. Planar power components are treated as alchemical reagents which amplify magical effects. The Realmwalker's Handbook introduces a number of new planar power components which can be used for either classic spellcasting or spherecasting. Planar power components function similarly to alchemical reagents, with a few notable alterations. A planar power component can be used as a consumable, additional material component or as a reusable focus when casting a spell or sphere effect, as though the caster were using the Material Casting or Focus Casting general casting drawbacks. Using a planar power component does not increase a spell or sphere effect's casting time, even if it would add a metamagic feat's effects. A planar power component's effects do not stack with either themselves or one another. As such, only a single planar power component can be included when casting a spell or sphere effect. Each planar power component notes the type of spells and sphere effects it is usable with, the number required when used as a material component (noted as \\\"doses\\\") or as an additional focus (noted as \\\"focus\\\"), and the effects of the component when used. Planar Component Foci as Crafted Equipment: \\nWhen a caster makes frequent use of planar power components as foci for their magics, it is common for to affix or craft the components into a held, slotted, or otherwise worn item, such as lining the head of a caster's staff or creating a simple broach or ring, to be used as the focus. Integrating a planar power component into an item does not cost any additional gold or resources (beyond the base item) and requires a number of doses of the planar power component sufficient to be used as a focus. If the resulting item is heavily composed of or incorporates the component in a more permanent manner, such as crafting the base of an amulet out of the material rather than just socketing it or reforging a sword's hilt out of the material, it may require a craftsman to safely craft the item, usually with a DC 15 Craft check of the appropriate kind and a few hours. The same check may be made to safely remove the components from the item, reclaiming the power components without destroying or harming the original item. There is no penalty for a failed check.\"\n",

While sequestered, the feinted creature can only see you, as their reality becomes warped and shifted to believing you and themselves are the only creatures to exist. During this time, the target cannot be interacted with in any way by other creatures, (except you) and vice versa. Alternatively, when you successfully sequester a creature using this talent, you may enter a stance, allowing the creature to remain sequestered for as long as you remain within the stance. The creature may attempt a Will saving throw at the end of each of their turns as a free action to no longer be sequestered, ending the stance and its effects on a successful save. This is a supernatural mind-affecting effect.\"\n",

This extends to the Divination sphere, protecting against (sense) talents which provide effects similar to blindsight or blindsense (such as greensight, tremorsense, thoughtsense, spiritsense, touchsense, et. al). This talent does not protect against all (sense) talents, only those which provide forms of perception similar to blindsight or blindsense or would otherwise pinpoint a creature using Stealth.\"\n",

When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:  If an effect would move you away from your grappled target, you may attempt a grapple combat maneuver against your grappled target's CMD as an immediate action. If the target is battered, you may spend an attack of opportunity in place of an immediate action instead. If you are successful, the grappled target is moved into the nearest unoccupied and safe space within your reach and remains grappled. A grappled target being moved this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If there is no unoccupied, safe space within your reach when attempting to move your grappled target with you, the target is moved into the nearest unoccupied, safe space near your new location, is released from your grapple, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier (minimum 1 round). Special:  The abilities granted by Stubborn Serpent's Coils do not function against Warp sphere effects or other teleportation effects. If you possess the Inescapable Grasp talent, you may use the abilities granted by this talent against teleportation or Warp effects originating from a source other than your grappled target which would move your grappled target out of your grapple. When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:  You are granted a saving throw or other appropriate check to negate a teleportation effect which would move your grappled target out of your grapple, as described in this ability. \\n When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:  You may include your grappled target in a teleport effect that would move you. If your grappled target is unwilling, the teleportation effect must be able to target an unwilling creature and the creature receives a saving throw against the effect, otherwise the grappled target is not moved with you and your grapple ends. Examples:  Grappling is a complex and often confusing combat maneuver. Two examples are included with this talent to help better demonstrate how this talent is used. If your grappled target is being moved away from you:  A creature which uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push your grappled target away from you must also succeed against your CMD while grappling. A Wind severity effect would fail to push your grappled target if the Wind severity effect fails to push you. If a Telekinesis sphere effect would attempt to lift and move your grappled target out of your reach, the Telekinesis sphere caster would treat this as contested control over an item. If you are being moved away from your grappled target:  If a creature uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push you away from your grappled target, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver as an immediate action (or as an attack of opportunity if the target is battered) against your grappled target.
