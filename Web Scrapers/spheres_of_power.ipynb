You may craft any item whose formulae you know in 30 minutes, or 15 minutes if you have access to an alchemist’s lab or alchemist’s crafting kit, but due to the volatile nature of the enhanced formulae you cannot have more formulae prepared at one time than a number equal to 1/2 your ranks in Craft (alchemy) (minimum 1) + the number of formulae talents you possess.

      "<p>Whenever you successfully perform a steal or dirty trick combat maneuver the target must succeed at a Will save or lose their martial focus. On a failed save, you may regain your martial focus as an immediate action.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc49\"><span>Steal Skill (trick)</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>When you successfully perform a steal combat maneuver against a target, you may make a single attack against that target with any weapon you possess as a free action. Creatures damaged by this attack are battered for 1 round. You may select this talent a second time; if you do, you may also apply it to successful dirty tricks.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc50\"><span>Steal Talent</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As long as you have martial focus, you may attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against a creature within 15 ft. of yourself, +5 ft. per 4 ranks in Sleight of Hand you possess. For every 10 ft. you are from a creature, you take a -2 penalty on your combat maneuver check.</p>\n",

      "<p>All practitioners of the Scout sphere gain the following ability:</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>Advisory Scout [Apoc]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As a swift action, you may identify a creature’s weaknesses (DC 10 + creature’s CR) as described under the Knowledge skill, but may substitute a Perception check for the appropriate Knowledge check at a -5 penalty. This only reveals the target’s weaknesses, or lack thereof, (such as damage reduction types and vulnerabilities), and does not reveal any additional information about the target. Once you have succeeded at a scout attempt or Knowledge check against a target, any talents or effects that require you to scout a target may be used against the target for the next 24 hours; after this period you must successfully use the scout ability against the target again to continue benefiting from related effects.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Battlefield Stealth [Alienist HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you move at least 10 ft. in a round and begin and end your turn in cover or concealment, you gain a competence bonus to Stealth checks equal to 1/2 your ranks in Stealth (minimum 1) for one round. You must end your movement in a different square than the one you started your turn to receive this benefit. If you use the Sniper function of the Stealth skill, the penalty to Stealth checks is reduced by -10 (to a minimum of 0).</p>\n",

      "<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Deadly Strike</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may scout a creature as a standard action, simultaneously scouting the creature and informing your allies of what you found. Allies within 60 feet that can hear you or otherwise communicate with you gain the benefits of your scout ability against the scouted creature for 1 round, plus 1 additional round per 4 ranks in Perception.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Discern Condition</span></h4>\n",
      "<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Advisory Scout shares the benefits of \"passive\" Scout sphere talents, such as Find Gap and Identify Rhythms. This talent does not share Scout sphere talents which grant active abilities against scouted targets (such as Target Weakness) or other non-Scout sphere abilities which would augment the scout ability.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span>Discern Illusions</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you or an ally would apply an effect which would cause a creature or creatures to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC, you may spend martial focus to attempt a Stealth check against those creatures as an immediate action. Your Stealth automatically ends if you do not enter cover or concealment, or use this ability again, by the end of your next turn.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span>Discern Tells</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you spend a swift action and successfully scout a target, you may move up to 1/2 your movement speed, provided that your movement ends in a space further away from the scouted target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc10\"><span>Find Gap</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you use this talent to move further away from a scouted target, if you perform a charge action against that scouted target before the end of your next turn, your first successful attack deals additional precision damage equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum 1). This additional precision damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc11\"><span>Great Senses</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you initiate an attack against a creature while they are unaware of your presence due to your use of Stealth, you deal additional precision damage to the target equal to 1/2 your ranks in Stealth (minimum 1) with your first attack. If you have successfully used the scout ability to identify the target’s weaknesses, you instead deal additional precision damage equal to your ranks in Stealth.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc12\"><span>Heightened Awareness</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may use the scout ability to determine the relative health and condition of a creature within line of sight and effect in addition to the normal information provided by your scout ability. You determine the creature’s condition based on the list below:</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc13\"><span>Hidden Appearance</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As long as you have martial focus, you gain a bonus to all Will saves against illusions (including glamers, figments, and any effects created by the illusion school or the Illusion sphere) equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum 1). As a swift action, you can expend martial focus to share this bonus with all allies within 30 ft. for a number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc14\"><span>Hidden Dragon (stance) [Youxia HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You gain a competence bonus to your Sense Motive checks equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum 1) against any creature you have successfully scouted. Training in this talent allows you to use Sense Motive to resist a Bluff attempt to feint if desired, even if you are not trained in Sense Motive.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc15\"><span>Hidden Focus</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you successfully use the scout ability against a creature, you treat their AC as 1 lower than it actually is for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum 1). For every 4 ranks you possess, treat their AC as an additional 1 point lower.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc16\"><span>Honed Sense [Apoc]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You gain 5 ranks in the Perception skill, plus 5 ranks per additional talent spent in the Scout sphere (maximum ranks equal to your total Hit Dice). If you already have ranks in the Perception skill you may immediately retrain them, but you do not get to retrain when only temporarily gaining talents, such as through the armiger’s customized weapons class feature.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc17\"><span>Identify Rhythms</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>When actively searching with the Perception skill (a move action), you may detect the presence of ongoing magical auras, such as those left by spells such as alarm or invisibility. If the target does not normally have a Perception DC, the DC is equal to the original spell DC as determined by the spell’s caster (DC 10 + spell level + caster’s casting ability modifier), or DC 25 if the effect does not originate from a source that would make it possible to determine a spell DC. This does not give you any information about the exact nature of magical effects detected in this manner, you are merely aware that a magical effect is active and the general area it is active in.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc18\"><span>Identify Structural Hazards</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>So long as you have martial focus, you may make a Perception check to notice the presence of traps or ongoing magical effects (as described above) whenever you pass within 10 ft. of them, whether or not you are actively looking.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc19\"><span>Lurker</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may make Stealth checks in place of Disguise checks to change your appearance.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc20\"><span>Piercing Eye</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>While in this stance, whenever you succeed at a combat maneuver check against a creature, that creature no longer counts as observing you until the end of your turn for the purpose of Stealth checks to hide.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc21\"><span>Reflexive Stealth</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you use the Stealth skill to successfully hide when making a move action, you regain your martial focus.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc22\"><span>Sense And Resist Scrying</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You gain the scent special ability, with a base distance of 30 feet. You receive a +4 bonus on Perception checks to detect creatures with the shaken, frightened, or panicked conditions using scent. You can substitute your Perception skill for Sense Motive skill checks if the subject has one of the previous conditions or is attempting to cover up their fear in some way. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Sharp Senses, Smell Fear.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc23\"><span>Sight Beyond Sight</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever you have successfully used the scout ability against a creature, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against all of their attacks. For every 4 ranks in Perception you possess, this dodge bonus increases by +1.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc24\"><span>Somnambulance</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may use Perception in place of Knowledge (dungeoneering) to identify underground hazards, in place of Knowledge (engineering) to identify dangerous construction or determine a structure’s weakness, and in place of Knowledge (nature) to identify a natural hazard.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc25\"><span>Study Technique [Youxia HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Creatures using unusual forms of sensory perception such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense cannot automatically foil your use of Stealth; such creatures must make a Perception check as normal to detect you when you make use of the Stealth skill.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc26\"><span>Sudden Acuity</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Lurker foils divination spells and <a href=\"/divination\">Divination</a> sphere sense abilities in the manner described above, but has no effect on spell, sphere, spell-like, or supernatural abilities specifically used to uncover information about you rather than enhancing the user’s perception, such as when scrying or using the <a href=\"/divination\">Divination</a> sphere‘s divine abilities.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc27\"><span>Target Weakness</span></h4>\n",
      "<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The Lurker talent protects against forms of perception, such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense, or other similar forms of vision which would pinpoint a creature and negate their use of Stealth. This does not include effects which would negate other things that allow you to stealth, such as true seeing or see invisibility.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc28\"><span>Track The Scene</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>This extends to the Divination sphere, protecting against (sense) talents which provide effects similar to blindsight or blindsense (such as greensight, tremorsense, thoughtsense, spiritsense, touchsense, et. al). This talent does not protect against all (sense) talents, only those which provide forms of perception similar to blindsight or blindsense or would otherwise pinpoint a creature using Stealth.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc29\"><span>Uncanny Dodge</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You have learned to see through obscuring effects and to spot the subtle patterns in defensive illusions. You may spend a move action to reduce your miss chance due to concealment on a single creature by 5% until the start of your next turn (this cannot reduce your miss chance due to concealment below 0).</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc30\"><span>Unimpeded Positioning</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>For every 2 ranks in Stealth you possess, you further reduce your miss chance due to concealment by an additional 5%. You may expend your focus to make this a free action. If the target is under the effects of the mirror image spell or a similar effect, you may roll twice and choose the most favorable result when determining if the target was struck.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc31\"><span>Wind Reader</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you succeed at a Reflex saving throw against an attack or effect that targets or affects multiple squares, you may make a Stealth check to hide even if you do not have cover or concealment. Your Stealth automatically ends if you do not enter cover or concealment, or succeed at a Reflex saving throw against another area effect, by the end of your next turn.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc33\"><span>By The Scruff Of Your Neck [Catgirl HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You are able to detect and evade the scrying of others. You may use a Perception check to detect sensors (such as from the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell) as if they were invisible creatures with a Stealth check of 20 + the caster level of the effect. As long as you have martial focus, you also immediately become aware of any attempt to scry on you, such as with a divination (scrying) school spell or the Scrying advanced divination talent. If these spells and effects originate within 30 ft. of you, you also know their location. As soon as you become aware of such an effect, you may force the caster to make a caster level check opposed by your Stealth check. If you succeed, the effect becomes unable to detect any information about yourself or the area or creatures within 30 ft. of you.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc34\"><span>Detect Surface Thoughts</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may spend a move action to grant yourself blindsense out to 10 ft. for one round. You may expend your martial focus when activating this ability to instead gain blindsight for the same duration. At 10 ranks in Perception, this distance increases to 15 ft.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc35\"><span>Dust To Dust [EO3]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Your acute senses have been trained to their peak, making you difficult to catch unaware even while sleeping. You no longer increase the DC of Perception checks made while you are sleeping, and falling unconscious or going to sleep no longer causes you to lose martial focus. In addition, you are no longer considered helpless while sleeping as your heightened senses allow you to react to threats your conscious mind is unaware of. You may take this talent a second time; the second time you take this talent, you no longer suffer most negative limitations of being asleep; this is functionally similar to immunity to sleep, though rather than staying awake when targeted by a sleep affect your subconscious mind and instincts simply take over, allowing you to continue fighting unimpeded, though you still cannot perform any Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc36\"><span>Eye Spy [Jester's HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may use the scout ability to determine the base attack bonus and martial spheres known of a creature within line of sight and effect in addition to the normal information provided by your scout ability.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc37\"><span>Inimical Gaze</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You gain a competence bonus to Perception checks equal to 1/2 your ranks in Stealth (minimum +1) when using the scout ability. When making an active Perception check as a move action, you may expend your martial focus to gain this bonus to that check.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc38\"><span>Magehunter’s Vision</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>If you have successfully used the scout ability to identify a target’s weaknesses, you may use scavenged materials collected as you travel to improvise a weapon targeting one of those weaknesses as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity; you may expend your martial focus to instead use this ability as a free action. The next attack you make against the target with a manufactured or natural weapon attack, including traps, is treated as though half the total damage it deals (rounded down) were of an energy type the target has vulnerability to (for example, if you fire an arrow at a red dragon, who has vulnerability to cold damage, and would normally deal 14 points of piercing damage, you instead deal 7 points of piercing damage and 10 points of cold damage); if this attack is not made before the end of your next turn, this effect is wasted.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc39\"><span>Spell Scent [High. HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Additional energy damage dealt by the attack, such as from the flaming or frost weapon special abilities, is calculated separately from this effect. Alternatively, your weapons are treated as having one type listed in the target’s damage reduction (for example, if an enemy has DR 5/cold iron or good, you may treat your attacks as either good or cold iron for 1 round).</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc40\"><span>True Sight</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You gain a competence bonus to Survival checks made to find and follow tracks equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum +1). When successfully following a set of tracks no older than 1 hour per rank in Stealth you possess (minimum 1 hour), you learn not only what direction they headed but what actions the tracked targets took before leaving the area and during their movement as long as you successfully continue to follow their trail; information gained in this manner is typically quite general, such as whether the targets paused and ate, split up, had an altercation, etc. Detailed information such as what spells they may have cast or items they may have used is typically unavailable, unless the targets left some tangible indication of the act behind, such as an empty potion bottle.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc41\"><span>Vanish</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You gain the ability to react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. You cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. You still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if a creature successfully uses the feint action against you. You may take this talent twice; the second time you take it, you can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a creature the ability to sneak attack you by flanking you, unless the attacker is at least four levels higher or has at least 4 more Hit Dice than you. If you have already gained uncanny dodge from another source, such as the rogue talent, the first instance of this talent instead gives you the benefits of improved uncanny dodge.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc42\"><span>Walk Unseen</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As long as you have martial focus, you ignore non-magical difficult terrain. Whenever you draw or reload a weapon as a move action, you may move up to 10 ft. as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Bashing Shield</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>If you are using a shield and you are attacked by a creature you are aware of while not flat-footed, you may spend an attack of opportunity to increase your shield bonus to AC against that attack by +2. This decision must be made before the roll is made. For every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess, the increase to your shield bonus provided by this talent increases by 1. Talents with the (deflect) tag grant additional effects to this ability. Each use of active defense may only benefit from one (deflect) talent. You may expend your martial focus to use active defense in place of spending an attack of opportunity.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>Battering Defense</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You do not lose your shield bonus to AC when making an attack with your shield. Additionally, you may make shield bash attacks with a buckler as if it were a light shield. Reduce the damage as if the shield bash was one size smaller when used this way. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Improved Shield Bash.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Blockade</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>If you deal damage to or succeed on a combat maneuver against a creature that missed an attack against a creature benefiting from your active defense before the end of your next turn, that creature becomes battered for 1 round.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc5\"><span>Cover Ally</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>When affected by an area attack, you may spend your martial focus as an immediate action to use your shield to cushion the blow, granting you the benefits of the evasion ability (regardless of armor worn), and adding your shield bonus (but not your active defense bonus) to your Reflex saving throw against the triggering effect. If you already possesses evasion, you instead gain improved evasion.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Deflecting Shield</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>All allied creatures in a cone originating from your space and facing away from the effect’s point of origin gain the benefits of this ability. Medium creatures create a 15-ft. cone. For every 4 points of base attack bonus and for every size category you are larger than Medium, the size of the cone increases by 5 ft. The size of the cone decreases by 5 ft. (minimum 5 ft.) for every size category you are smaller than Medium.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Extensive Defense</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As long as you have martial focus, you may use active defense to benefit an ally when an ally within your shield’s reach is targeted by an attack.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span>Flexible Cover</span></h4>\n",
      "<p><sup><strong>Note:</strong> This only provides the benefits of active defense, not the benefit of the base shield. (<a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42esx?SoM-Cover-ally#4\">Source</a>)</sup></p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span>Greater Deflect</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Your shield bonus to AC applies against touch attacks.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc10\"><span>Hardened Shield</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may expend martial focus as a free action that can be taken even when it’s not your turn to apply your active defense against all valid triggering attacks until the start of your next turn without spending attacks of opportunity. If you possess the Cover Ally talent, you may apply this benefit to all allies within reach.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc11\"><span>Interposing Shield</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You may spend a move action to use a shield to grant you cover until the beginning of your next turn. Bucklers, heavy shields, and light shields provide partial cover while tower shields provide total cover. When using a shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain cover for attacks that pass through this edge. The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. Cover granted this way is insufficient to enable you to make a Stealth check to hide and the shield may be targeted as an attended object.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc12\"><span>Punch Block</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>As an immediate action, you may change the selected edge of your space even when it is not your turn. If you expend martial focus, you may use this talent as an immediate action.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc13\"><span>Reactive Defense</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>When using active defense, you may expend martial focus to apply two (deflect) talents instead of one.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc14\"><span>Reassuring Imposition [Apoc]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Any shield you have equipped gains a competence bonus to its hardness equal to your base attack bonus.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc15\"><span>Shield Skate</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Creatures benefiting from your active defense bonus (including yourself) gain DR/- equal to the bonus from active defense against attacks that hit despite active defense. This damage reduction stacks with damage reduction from other sources.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc16\"><span>Shielded Focus</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>When you use your active defense, you may choose to make an attack roll as if making a shield bash and must use the result of this attack in place of your AC for resolving the attack, even if lower. You must be capable of making shield bash attacks with the shield to use this ability.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc17\"><span>Snapping Tortoise (stance) [Youxia HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p><strong>Note:</strong> Punch Block replaces your entire AC bonus with your attack roll; treat this as though using your active defense. This is not a shield bonus, and does not apply to attacks which would bypass your shield bonus. The Deflecting Shield talent does not allow Punch Block to apply against touch attacks.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc18\"><span>Targe Riposte [High. HB]</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>Whenever you take the total defense action while wielding a shield, creatures that miss you provoke attacks of opportunity from you. You may make these attacks of opportunity but take a penalty on the attack rolls as if you were fighting defensively.</p>\n",

      "<p>When moving down an incline or using the charge action, you may spend a swift action to throw your shield down in front of you and use it to skate across the ground. This gives you a 10 ft. circumstance bonus to your land speed for that round. You do not benefit from your shield bonus to AC during your movement while using this ability. You may reclaim and reequip your shield as a free action at the end of your movement.</p>\n",

      "<p>For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, the circumstance bonus to your land speed increases by 10 ft.

      "<p>Additionally, whenever an attack misses a creature benefiting from your active defense, you may regain your martial focus as an immediate action.</p>\n",

      "<p>While in this stance, whenever a creature misses an attack against a creature benefiting from your active defense, your next successful attack action against that creature before the end of your next turn forces that creature to succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone even if you are no longer in this stance.</p>\n",
      "<h4 id=\"toc29\"><span>Perfect Redirection</span></h4>\n",
      "<p>You can use the hand wielding a light shield to also wield a light or one-handed weapon, as if it were a buckler, but you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls (instead of -1). If the hand wielding the light shield is wielding a weapon from the close or light blades fighter weapon group, you only take a -1 penalty on attack rolls. Whenever you would attempt a melee attack with a shield bash, you may instead attempt a melee attack with a light or one-handed weapon from the close or light blades fighter weapon groups wielded in your shield hand.</p>\n",
