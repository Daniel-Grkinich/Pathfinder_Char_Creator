      "    \"benefits\": \"If you have a secured rope, a set piton, thrown a grappling hook, or wrapped a whip or similar weapon around a point, you may use the attached rope or weapon to spring around the battlefield. There are five methods for securing a rope: Flail Group Weapon:  Weapons from the flails weapon group may be used as if they were a grappling hook, though applying them requires a melee attack roll rather than a ranged attack roll. A length of rope may be used in this way also, taking improvised weapon penalties as appropriate. Grappling Hook:  You may throw a held grappling hook as a swift action, making a grapple check against a creature or a ranged attack roll against an unattended object. This deals no damage. You may use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier on this grapple check. A creature may remove a grappling hook as a move action with a Strength or Escape Artist check against this sphere's DC or a grapple check against your grapple CMD. The range increment of a grappling hook is improved to 20 ft. Grappling Weapon:  If you are grappling a creature via the grappling special feature of a weapon, a rope attached to that weapon counts as secure for the duration of the grapple. Piton:  You may draw a piton and rope and attempt to set it in an object or creature within reach as a standard action, dealing 1d4 + Strength modifier damage. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must succeed on a melee attack to place the piton on a creature. A creature can remove a set piton as a move action with a Strength check equal to this sphere's DC. If you fail to deal damage, your attempt fails. Tie:  You also may simply secure a rope to a suitable point within reach (a pillar, post, chandelier, etc.) as a standard action. Any creature within reach may untie this rope as a standard action. Once your rope is secured by any of the above methods, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the rope or weapon's reach (as determined from the anchor point), to a maximum of 30 ft. without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by making a Climb check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. Use your reach (not threatened area) to determine the maximum movement length when using a weapon from the flail group for this ability. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. You may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling if you succeed on a Climb check against the surface's DC. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or creatures, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the rope's reach). You must have a free hand to use this ability. Movement using this ability counts as climbing for the purpose of the (climb) package's movement bonuses. For every 4 ranks in Climb you possess, you may move an additional 5 ft. with this talent. If you possess the Mobile Striker talent, you may replace the movement portion of that talent with the movement granted by this talent. Ropes or weapons affixed to creatures by any method above allow both the creature to which the rope is affixed (the target) and the creature holding the rope or weapon (the holder) to attempt drag and reposition combat maneuvers against each other. The holder may always choose to drop the rope or weapon as a free action on his turn or as an immediate action off-turn. Example: Azeem the conscript is facing a force of kobolds in a tunnel. Two of them, wielding clubs, have moved adjacent to attack him, while two more are behind a barricade 30 ft. down the tunnel with crossbows. Jorr draws (a move action) and throws (a swift action) his grappling hook to attach it to the overhead scaffolding 25 ft. away, then attempts to swing to just behind the crossbow-wielding kobolds to a space 35 ft. from his current position, 10 ft. beyond the anchor point. Jorr must make a Climb check and compare it to the CMDs of all four kobolds, since two are adjacent to his starting position and two adjacent to his ending position. If he succeeds, he moves without provoking attacks of opportunity, springing over the heads of the nearby kobolds, swinging over the barricade and kicking off the tunnel wall to land beyond the far foe. Errata:  Releasing or unsecuring a rope after a swing is a free action. ( Source )\"\n",

For every size the creature is larger than you, you gain a +3 bonus on your Climb check against that creature. You can climb with only one hand as part of using this ability, but you must have at least one hand free. While you are on a creature, you move with it whenever it moves. For every size larger that the creature is than you, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks against you. The creature is also flat-footed against your attacks. You may climb down the creature to an unoccupied adjacent square as a swift action, taking no damage, or jump off as a free action that can be taken even when it's not your turn, taking falling damage as appropriate to the creature's height. The creature may make a combat maneuver check against your CMD to dislodge you, causing you to fall into an adjacent square; you may substitute your Climb skill modifier + 10 in place of your CMD for this check (this includes the +3 bonus per size category). If the creature spends a full-round action to drop prone and roll, it gains a +10 bonus on this check and you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each size category larger than you the creature is unless you choose to jump off. If you are grappled by a creature while scaling a different creature, if the scaled creature leaves the reach of the grappling creature, the grapple ends instantly. If you are subject to an effect originating from another creature that would move you while scaling an enemy and you are moved so that the scaled creature is no longer within your natural reach, this ability ends instantly. If the target creature is impaled per the impale ability of the Lancer sphere, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to CMD against grapple checks made by the target to remove you and count any hand being used to control the weapon used to impale the target as being used for the climb check.

This requires 8 hours and a creature of the animal type that has an attitude toward you of indifferent or better. This time may be divided as per the magic item crafting rules. You may only train one creature at a time with this ability. At the end of this period, make a Handle Animal check with a DC of 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. If successful, the creature is now considered tame. You may not tame a creature with more Hit Dice than you have ranks in Handle Animal. You may have multiple tame creatures under your control, but their total Hit Dice cannot exceed your ranks in Handle Animal. If you attempt to tame a creature that would exceed your Hit Dice cap, you must choose which other creatures to release. Animal companions and familiars, such as from class features, the Animal Companion talent, or the Pet talent, never count against this Hit Dice cap. You may not use this ability on a creature with the swarm subtype. A creature with a template adds the challenge rating adjustment of the template to its HD (minimum increase +0) for determining if you may tame it and for how many creatures you can have tame. Variant creatures with increased challenge ratings (such as a pyrohydra compared to a normal hydra, if using the Broad Skills talent), treats the challenge rating increase of the variant as if it were a template for this purpose. A creature whose permanent Intelligence score is raised above 2 is no longer a valid target for this ability and is automatically released. This effect ends if you go two full days without spending at least 1 hour training your tame creatures. This is treated as an extraordinary mind-affecting compulsion effect for the purposes of opposed control checks, such as another compulsion effect affecting your tame creature.

This is not intelligence, it is simply learned mannerisms that conveniently allow an animal to react to both simple and complex social situations, and react appropriately to questions and conversations as though it understood languages the handler possessed at the time they taught the animal this trick. In addition, when attempting a Disguise check to alter an animal's appearance, the Disguise check takes no penalties due to different gender, race, age, or size category. Disguising an animal in this way may be as simple as putting a hat on a bear to applying full makeup and costumery to a salamander. An animal disguised this way does not automatically draw attention to itself, though it may draw suspicion if it does not behave appropriately to a situation. You may substitute your Handle Animal bonus in place of your Disguise bonus when attempting this check.

      "    \"benefits\": \"Prerequisites:  Beastmastery sphere, Handle Animal 5 ranks. You may speak with animals. You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but this ability doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Adjusted Companion Base Attack Bonus Reasoning:  Animal companions begin to struggle at high levels of play due to having 3/4 base attack bonus compared to a Conjuration sphere or Leadership sphere companion's full base attack bonus. GMs may find it appropriate to adjust the scaling of animal companions by implementing this variant rule. Rule:  An animal companion's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Beastmastery and Taming Intelligent Creatures As a variant-rule to the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery legendary talent, GMs may allow characters to \\\"tame\\\" other intelligent creatures to aid and assist them as companions. This optional variant rule should be treated the same as a legendary talent. It is powerful and potentially world altering and should be handled with care and allowed with supervision. Rule:  Characters with the Beastmastery sphere Mindless Mastery (handle animal) legendary talent may tame creatures of any type and of any intelligence. GMs have ultimate control over what creatures are appropriate to be tamed. Intelligent creatures tamed this way are recruited similarly to a Leadership sphere cohort, attempting a Handle Animal check against a base DC of 10 + the Hit Dice of the creature you are looking to tame. This check is not modified by Settlement Size Modifiers or Miscellaneous Modifiers but can be modified by circumstantial elements by GM discretion. Context and Reasoning:  A primary pillar of balance for the Beastmastery sphere is that it is not the Leadership feat or the Leadership sphere. The Beastmastery sphere is limited to taming and handling creatures with \\\"animal intelligence\\\" (2 Intelligence or less). This is because a creature with 3 Intelligence or greater is considered sapient, rather than just sentient. A sapient creature is one capable of complex thoughts, expressions, and actions. Put simply, intelligent creatures are intelligent. As of this handbook, the only way to recruit another fully-intelligent creature as a companion is through the Leadership sphere Advanced Cohorts (cohort) legendary talent, which is the same talent used to recruit \\\"people\\\", or otherwise recapture the original strength of the Leadership feat. While this is a valid option for those looking to recruit outsiders and other adventurers, or realistically anything you come across, it often comes as a disconnect that the Beastmastery sphere cannot gain magical creatures as companions, such as a talented beastmaster coming across a noble unicorn but being unable to recruit or convince them to join them any better than another character. This sphere-specific variant rule functions primarily as an adjustment to the Mindless Mastery legendary talent as the \\\"capstone\\\" of being a tamer, allowing a Beastmastery practitioner to \\\"tame\\\" any creature. This only functions as the handle animal package's tame ability for counting the tamed creature's Hit Dice against the total number of Hit Dice a character may control and differs in nearly every other aspect. When allowing intelligent creatures to be tamed through Beastmastery, GM's should be aware of and consider the following: What Is Tameable:  Only \\\"reasonably creature-like\\\" creatures should be tameable. This variant rule is not meant to replace Leadership sphere and should not be used to tame humanoid, monstrous humanoid, humanoid-like outsiders and other highly intelligent and autonomous creatures. The main purpose is to allow someone to befriend a unicorn, or raise an owlbear or dragon hatchling, not recruit a retinue of robots. Intelligent creatures fall into three categories of \\\"tameability\\\":\\n \\n 1. \\\"Magical Creatures\\\":  Griffon, unicorns, behirs and other magical beasts are generally appropriate to be tamed with this variant rule. \\n 2. \\\"Unusual Creatures\\\":  Things like feral aberrations, wyverns, hatchling dragons, sentient oozes, plants, and vermin are usually appropriate, but depend on the circumstances and rely more heavily on GM permission. \\n 3. \\\"Inappropriate Creatures\\\":  Adult dragons, outsiders, golems, humanoids (humans, trolls, etc.) and other creatures that have either incredibly powerful abilities or have human-like capacity should almost never be appropriate, although exceptions can be made by a GM, such as a powerful paladin recruiting a dragon to their cause. Other players are not appropriate, as are townsfolk and other \\\"people\\\". Ultimately, the GM has final say over what can be recruited as an animal ally. \\n \\n \\n Willing and Non-Hostile:  A tamed intelligent creature is not compelled to assist and does so out of their free will and their relationship with the character. Creatures have their own motivations, goals, needs, and morality and can never be forced to do something self-destructive or against their nature. This extends to the Beast Tamer legendary talent. An intelligent creature can never be forcibly conscripted unless it would be willing to in the first place. Likewise, the creature should not be hostile to the character or have competing goals. Attempting to tame an actively hostile mimic or a rampaging bulette should not be possible. Likewise, attempting to tame the evil dragon serving as the \\\"BBEG\\\" of the story should not be possible. A creature must be willing to help and follow the character. \\n \\\"Tamed\\\":  A tamed intelligent creature is treated as an animal ally when appropriate but is interacted with and treated as a companion in the ordinary sense of the word. When spending at least 1 hour with your tamed creatures, a character does not need to re-tame them or interact with them the same way they would a tamed wolf or hydra. Spending time with a tamed intelligent creature can be as simple as checking up on them, sharing a meal, and interacting with them as if they were a normal NPC. If something would assert competing non-magical influence over the creature, such as trying to convince them to join them, it is the creature's choice as a function of roleplay, motivations, and desires. Magical compulsion effects, however, are treated as a competing effect and allow a tamed intelligent creature to resist as appropriate. \\n Unequal Partnerships:  Not every Beastmastery practitioner will be looking to form a compassionate, fair bond with others. In establishing this variant rule, it is important to not treat the tame ability as a form of servitude or slavery. However, some characters, particularly evil ones, may want to roleplay these interactions as the \\\"overlord\\\" or \\\"master\\\" of a so-called lesser creature. It is not the goal of this variant rule to make gameplay uncomfortable for others, or inappropriate, so it is important for players and their GM to discuss how they want this ability to be treated. Some may prefer the equal companionship aspect whereas others may want to treat it as servitude. These choices are all respective and contingent on the previous considerations listed with this variant rule. Where one character may want to form a bond with a wise, ancient owlbear of the woods, another may be playing an antipaladin and want to tempt a noble unicorn to fall to darkness. Both of these choices are perfectly valid, but it should be a goal to not execute this variant rule in a way that it makes others uncomfortable. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Improved Familiars and Familiar Archetypes Reasoning:  As Pathfinder developed, familiar archetypes became a fun and interesting way to customize your familiars and how you interact with them and what benefits you gain from them. Improved Familiars have always lost their ability to speak with other creatures of their kind because most improved familiar options can already talk or understand languages. GMs may find it appropriate to remove this change and allow improved familiars with familiar archetypes. This will often be an upgrade over a normal improved familiar but will not offer any unusual increases in power that would not be otherwise available. Rule:  The Improved Familiar feat and Improved Pet legendary talent do not remove a familiar's ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Improved familiars may take familiar archetypes that would remove the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind. Sphere-Specific Variant Rule: Multiple Animal Companions and Alternatives Reasoning:  Through various means, characters may gain separate class features which independently grant animal companions or mounts, granting them in such a way that the character receives multiple, full-progression animal companions. Multiple animal companions can happen when an animal companion class feature is granted with restrictions, such as a lion shaman druid's restriction to lion animal companions also gaining access to the mount class feature. Restricting the druid to rideable creatures only would grant to separate companions as the effective druid levels for both companions could not combine. While as written this works, GMs should review whether they want a character to have control of multiple companions and consider how that may affect the flow of combat and gameplay. Players, on the other hand, should consider whether they actually want multiple companions, or if they do not want the extra resources and stat blocks to manage. Rule:  By GM permission, three potential solutions to the issue of multiple animal companions: 1: Improved Bond:  By forgoing one of the additional companions, the character chooses one teamwork feat he qualifies for. Both the character and his companion gain this teamwork feat; the companion may use and benefit from this teamwork feat even if it would not normally meet the prerequisites. This teamwork feat can be rechosen after 8 hours of rest. \\n 2: Refund:  \\\"Refund\\\" the character's class feature granting the extra companion by granting them one or two bonus Beastmastery sphere talents when they would gain the second companion. For example, a sacred huntsmaster inqiusitor choosing the chivalry domain could gain a bonus Beastmastery sphere talent or other thematically appropriate talent as a substitute to the extra horse they would otherwise have. \\n 3: Retraining or Different Choices:  Either through retraining or GM permission, the character may reselect one of their companion-granting abilities, retraining it to a different and more appropriate option.

Planar Power Components Whether excavated, purified, or procured through other means, distant worlds and strange planes are often the home of new materials, many of which are useful for magic. Alchemical power components were first introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory and planar power components were introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Plane-Hopper's Handbook. Planar power components are treated as alchemical reagents which amplify magical effects. The Realmwalker's Handbook introduces a number of new planar power components which can be used for either classic spellcasting or spherecasting. Planar power components function similarly to alchemical reagents, with a few notable alterations. A planar power component can be used as a consumable, additional material component or as a reusable focus when casting a spell or sphere effect, as though the caster were using the Material Casting or Focus Casting general casting drawbacks. Using a planar power component does not increase a spell or sphere effect's casting time, even if it would add a metamagic feat's effects. A planar power component's effects do not stack with either themselves or one another. As such, only a single planar power component can be included when casting a spell or sphere effect. Each planar power component notes the type of spells and sphere effects it is usable with, the number required when used as a material component (noted as \\\"doses\\\") or as an additional focus (noted as \\\"focus\\\"), and the effects of the component when used. Planar Component Foci as Crafted Equipment: \\nWhen a caster makes frequent use of planar power components as foci for their magics, it is common for to affix or craft the components into a held, slotted, or otherwise worn item, such as lining the head of a caster's staff or creating a simple broach or ring, to be used as the focus. Integrating a planar power component into an item does not cost any additional gold or resources (beyond the base item) and requires a number of doses of the planar power component sufficient to be used as a focus. If the resulting item is heavily composed of or incorporates the component in a more permanent manner, such as crafting the base of an amulet out of the material rather than just socketing it or reforging a sword's hilt out of the material, it may require a craftsman to safely craft the item, usually with a DC 15 Craft check of the appropriate kind and a few hours. The same check may be made to safely remove the components from the item, reclaiming the power components without destroying or harming the original item. There is no penalty for a failed check.\"\n",

      "    \"benefits\": \"You channel the serpent, improving your tenacity and grip. You gain the following abilities which can be used while grappling: When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:  While you are grappling another creature, any effect which would move your grappled target out of your reach must also succeed against you and your relevant statistic (CMD, saving throw, ability check, etc.) or fail to move the grappled target. When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:  If an effect would move you away from your grappled target, you may attempt a grapple combat maneuver against your grappled target's CMD as an immediate action. If the target is battered, you may spend an attack of opportunity in place of an immediate action instead. If you are successful, the grappled target is moved into the nearest unoccupied and safe space within your reach and remains grappled. A grappled target being moved this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If there is no unoccupied, safe space within your reach when attempting to move your grappled target with you, the target is moved into the nearest unoccupied, safe space near your new location, is released from your grapple, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier (minimum 1 round). Special:  The abilities granted by Stubborn Serpent's Coils do not function against Warp sphere effects or other teleportation effects. If you possess the Inescapable Grasp talent, you may use the abilities granted by this talent against teleportation or Warp effects originating from a source other than your grappled target which would move your grappled target out of your grapple. When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:  You are granted a saving throw or other appropriate check to negate a teleportation effect which would move your grappled target out of your grapple, as described in this ability. \\n When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:  You may include your grappled target in a teleport effect that would move you. If your grappled target is unwilling, the teleportation effect must be able to target an unwilling creature and the creature receives a saving throw against the effect, otherwise the grappled target is not moved with you and your grapple ends. Examples:  Grappling is a complex and often confusing combat maneuver. Two examples are included with this talent to help better demonstrate how this talent is used. If your grappled target is being moved away from you:  A creature which uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push your grappled target away from you must also succeed against your CMD while grappling. A Wind severity effect would fail to push your grappled target if the Wind severity effect fails to push you. If a Telekinesis sphere effect would attempt to lift and move your grappled target out of your reach, the Telekinesis sphere caster would treat this as contested control over an item. If you are being moved away from your grappled target:  If a creature uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push you away from your grappled target, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver as an immediate action (or as an attack of opportunity if the target is battered) against your grappled target. If you are successful, the grappled target also moves into an unoccupied, safe space within your reach and your grapple would not end.\"\n",

Unlike other transformations, the Blank Transformation does not change the creature's basic makeup. They do not gain the +10 bonus to Disguise checks, nor do they lose their abilities, equipment, natural attacks, or any other aspect of their unaltered form. The Blank Transformation allows a caster to add traits to a creature without fundamentally changing the target first. As a trait, you may change the target's cosmetic appearance. This could include changing the target's apparent age, making an elf into an orc, adding a purely cosmetic tail, disguising a large dog as a small pony, changing a male into a female, or some other such alteration. This grants the target a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. This trait may only be applied to the Blank Transformation, as such changes are assumed with other forms. Note: Legs Creatures without legs are immune to being tripped. Creatures with 4 or more legs gain a +4 bonus to their CMD vs. trip for each pair of legs beyond the first, and are treated as quadrupeds for the purpose of their carrying capacity. Creature Types and Alteration Talents While assuming a creature's form with the Alteration sphere generally does not cause the transformed creature to change their creature type or subtype, sometimes various abilities require correlating creature types and subtypes to their respective talents. The table below connects various creature types to the appropriate talent. In the case of the animal and magical beast types, general descriptions of their forms are used to better match the available talents. Note that there may be specific cases where an unusual creature fits poorly with the form granted by the talent corresponding to its type. In these cases it is up to the GM to discern the most suitable talent.

(Requires the Swarm trait) Gaseous Body:  You grant the target the ability to shift into or out of a gas-like form (e.g. fine mist, a cloud of insects, etc.) as a move action. While in this gas-like form, the target gains a fly speed of 10 feet with maneuverability (perfect), +5 feet per 5 caster levels, replacing all other movement the target may possess. Anything the target was wearing or holding transforms with the target, and the target loses its armor and natural armor bonuses. The target cannot manipulate or interact with objects, make attacks, speak, or cast spells with verbal, somatic, or focus components (unless the target possesses an ability to do so, such as the Silent Spell metamagic feat). Any traits or supernatural abilities the target possesses which alter or require its physical body are suppressed, including Alteration sphere traits. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even cracks. The target is still subject to the effects of wind and cannot enter water or other liquid. Granting this trait costs an additional spell point. [Gravecaller's HB] Swarm:  You may spend a spell point to turn the target into a swarm of creatures. The swarm can be composed only of Tiny creatures, with appearance and movement per the shapeshift. This size cannot be altered by the Size Change trait, enlarge person, or other effects. This does not affect the target's movement modes. The target can move through small holes and openings that are large enough for the individual creatures. The swarm fills a 10-foot square (or cube if flying) and has a reach of 0. The target gains a 25% ability to ignore critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5 caster levels to a maximum of 100%. The swarm has the distraction ability, forcing any creature that takes swarm damage to succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier or be nauseated for 1 round. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a magical skill check (DC 20 + 1/2 caster level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration while in the swarm requires a DC 20 Will save. The target may choose to ignore any creatures in its space, choosing to not deal the swarm damage, force magical skill checks to cast spells, or force Will saves to skills. The swarm form is incapable of performing combat maneuvers and they cannot be bull rushed, dragged, grappled, repositioned, or tripped. Creatures in swarm form take 50% more damage from effects that affect an area. Creatures in swarm form do not threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. The swarm automatically deals 1d6 + Constitution modifier damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its turn. This damage increases by 1d6 per 5 caster levels and may be modified by traits that require a natural attack (such as the Poison trait from the Vermin Transformation talent) but not those that modify natural attacks (such as the Powerful Claws trait from the Powerful Limbs talent). A creature that retains a natural attack (such as a shifter via a bestial trait) or is granted a natural attack by another trait cannot use it, but uses d8 for its swarm damage. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover.\"\n",

This trait may be granted multiple times, granting an additional roper strand per additional trait. As a standard action, (or full-round action if using multiple strands), the target may launch their strands, making one ranged touch attack per strand at a target within close range. Each strands clings to the target, causing 1 Strength damage each round they remain attached (increasing by 1 die size per 5 caster levels; i.e. 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). A Fortitude save (10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier) negates this damage for the round. A creature cannot be affected more than once per round. Strands have 1 hit point, and hardness equal to the effect's caster level, and a Break DC, Escape Artist DC, and AC equal to 10 + the effect's caster level. However, strands are instantly severed by any slashing damage, which bypasses its hardness automatically. Creatures connected by roper strands may not move away from each other, though may choose to move closer or laterally. Moving farther requires severing the strand with an attack, breaking it with a Strength check, or removing it with an Escape Artist check, or succeeding on a drag combat maneuver against the target they are connected to. When two targets are connected by a strand, they may attempt drag combat maneuver checks against each other at range without provoking attacks of opportunity. If a strand is broken, the target instantly regrows the strand, and may still make strand attacks.\"\n",

The winds generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 feet to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature). (Requires wings and a fly speed) \\n Improved Maneuverability:  The target's flight maneuverability improves by one step, +1 per 10 caster levels. (Requires a fly speed) \\n Wingover:  Once each round, the target can turn up to 180 degrees as a free action without attempting a Fly check. This free turn does not consume any additional movement.

Each elemental package notes separately the granted movement, including abilities related to that movement, and abilities: Air: Movement:  The target takes no damage when falling and may glide, moving with a speed of 30 feet with maneuverability (good), falling 1 foot for every 5 feet traveled. At 5th level, this improves to a 30 feet fly speed with maneuverability (good).

The target's first successful attack each round made with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon deals additional damage of the chosen energy type equal to your caster level. \\n Elemental Movement:  Choose air, earth, fire, or water. The target gains the chosen elemental package's movement from the Elemental Transformation talent and any abilities related to that movement (such as air's glide, earth's tremorsense, or water's ability to breathe underwater). If fire is chosen and the target lacks a land speed, the target gains a base land speed of 40 feet. You may grant this trait multiple times, each time choosing a different elemental package's movement. \\n Elemental Resistance:  Choose acid, cold, electricity or fire.

You may take this talent twice. Upon taking it a second time, you gain the ability to emulate other materials per Table: Transformation Materials , and to grant the form of complex objects. Complex objects, such as those with moving parts, require an appropriate Craft check at the object's craft DC. Failure means the target is not usable as an object. A creature under the effect of this talent does not truly become an object, thus is not a valid target for the Enhancement sphere Animate Object talent or similar effects. A creature that takes the form of a ranged weapon must be supplied with ammunition as normal, but is capable of loading and firing itself. A creature under the effects of this talent that is used as ammunition is not destroyed when used as ammunition, but takes damage equal to the damage dealt by the attack it was used for.

The target may duplicate any color of light, even creating multiple colors, and may cancel or resume use of this ability as a free action. \\n Material Weapons:  The target's unarmed strikes and natural weapons are treated as silver and cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

The target can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing. The target also gains the Amoeba, Gelatinous Cube, Jelly, or Pudding package depending on which ooze or slime is being mimicked. If you spend an additional spell point when granting this form, the target gains a 25% ability to ignore critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5 caster levels to a maximum of 100%. This spell point also makes the target blind but grants blindsight out to 60 ft. (thus negating the blind condition's normal penalties) and grants immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, visual illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight unless gaining eyes from another source. The target also gains one of the following packages depending on which ooze or slime is being mimicked: Amoeba:  The target gains a 20 feet swim speed, a 10 ft. climb speed, and the ability to breathe underwater. \\n Gelatinous Cube:  The target is transparent, granting a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks that does not stack with invisibility. The target also gains resistance to electricity equal to the effect's caster level. \\n Jelly:  The acid damage from the target's slam only affects organic material and not stone or metal. Unless a creature succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier), the acid damage affects any clothing and non-metal armor a creature is wearing on a successful attack, and also damages any wooden weapon that successfully attacks the jelly. This damage bypasses the material's hardness. The target also gains a resistance to electricity equal to the effect's caster level. \\n Pudding:  The target's acid damage only affects organic material and not stone or metal, and deals damage to clothing, armor, and wooden weapons as described under jellies above. Additionally, the target gains a climb speed of 20 feet, and the ability to suction. Activating or deactivating suction is a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed, but may climb any surface with ease, even inverted ones. Suction also grants a +10 circumstance bonus to CMD vs. bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that would physically move the target. Ooze Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Acidic Body:  The target's body is dangerous to the touch. The target's unarmed strikes or one slam attack (if it possesses one) deals +1d4 acid damage, as detailed above under the Ooze Transformation. If the target already possesses this acid damage, such as through the Ooze Transformation, the damage instead increases by one size category (two die sizes). \\n Acidic Nature:  The target must possess a slime's acid damage, either through the Ooze Transformation or the acidic body trait, to gain this trait. The target's acid only affects organic material and not stone or metal, and damages clothing and wood, as detailed under jellies above. If the target already possess this ability, such as through the jelly or pudding packages above, its acid now affects metal and can dissolve metal armor and metal weapons in addition to wood and cloth. \\n Engulf:  The target must possess the form from Ooze Transformation, or else the fluid body trait, to gain this trait. As a standard action, the target may move up to its speed and attempt to engulf anything in its path. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs. The creature merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Strength modifier) to avoid being engulfed - on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the creature's body until they are no longer pinned, and take acid damage from the target each round if it possesses either the Ooze Transformation or the acidic body trait. An engulfed creature may attempt to escape as if escaping a pin. \\n Fluid Body:  The target can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.\"\n",

A creature in the form of an orb counts as one size smaller for the purposes of stealth and squeezing into small places. Orb Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Aura of Fascination:  The target projects a 30-foot aura that fascinates creatures which are near it. Such creatures must succeed at a Will save or be fascinated for as long as they remain in the aura. A creature that makes its save is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The target may choose to suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This ability ceases to function if the target is stunned, paralyzed, unconscious, dead, or otherwise incapacitated. This is a mind-affecting effect. \\n Beam:  The target can fire a ray as a standard action. This ray is a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 30 feet and deals 1d6 damage + 1d6 per 3 caster levels. The ray's damage is untyped and overcomes damage reduction of any type, though hardness still applies. At 10th caster level, and every 10 caster levels thereafter, the ray's maximum range increases by 30 feet. If you spend an additional spell point when granting this trait, the target can charge the ray as a full-round action. At any time after the ray is charged, the target can fire it as a standard action as a 100 feet line, dealing 1d6 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6) plus an additional amount of fire damage equal to twice your caster level (Reflex half; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC).

When falling the target may choose to descend at a slower rate to control its fall and to negate all falling damage it would take. Each round it descends 30 feet, and may move in another direction for 30 feet. It may choose to drift sideways, gliding forwards while descending, or down, safely increasing its rate of descent. It may even choose to drift 'upwards' to reduce its rate of descent, even allowing it to negate it entirely and hover midair.\"\n",

Creatures other than the target who begin their turn or enter the cloud of pollen are staggered for one round (Fortitude negates; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Treat this as a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. While a direct hit deals no damage, any creature within 10 + 5 feet per 5 caster levels from the sporepod's point of contact is confused for 1+1d6 rounds (Will partial; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). A creature that succeeds at its save is sickened for 1 round instead. The sporepod is a mind-affecting poison effect. This trait costs an additional spell point.

If successful, the grappled creature is knocked prone. This additional grapple check does not count as maintaining the grapple and does not add any other effects on a successful grapple (such as constrict). \\n Serpentine Tail:  The shapeshifted target gains a tail and a circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to +1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, the shapeshifted target may use this tail to perform trip combat maneuvers within their natural reach, gaining a bonus on trip combat maneuvers made this way equal to 1/2 the circumstance bonus granted to Acrobatics checks from this talent (minimum 1). If you gain the ability to use this tail with a tail slap natural attack, attacks made with this tail gain the trip universal monster ability.  Special:  When granting this trait, you may choose to have this tail replace the shapeshifted target's legs. If you do, the shapeshifted target's base land speed is reduced by 10 (to a minimum of 5 feet) and the target cannot be tripped.

This trait may be taken twice; the second time allows the target to swallow creatures up to their own size and grants a bonus to CMB and CMD equal to 1 + 1 per 3 caster levels on grapple checks made to swallow creatures or to prevent them from escaping once swallowed. More than one creature may be swallowed at a time, but may not exceed the maximum total size that can be swallowed, counting two Tiny creatures as one Small creature, two Small creatures as one Medium creature, etc. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon, or it can just try to escape the grapple. The amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 the creature's total hit points. This damage is inflicted on the swallowing creature as normal.

You may spend a spell point to target two creatures adjacent to each other with your shapeshift and merge them together into one amalgamated body. When doing so, choose one of the creatures to be the primary creature and one to be the secondary creature. Fusion counts as a shapeshift on the secondary creature which occupies the same space as the primary creature, but a different shapeshift can be applied to the primary creature as normal. You may choose to apply a different shapeshift to the primary creature with the same action as applying the fusion, which share concentration and duration. An amalgamated body can only have one creature merged into it at a time. The new amalgamated body possesses current and maximum hit points equal to those of both creatures combined. The amalgamated body possesses the extraordinary and supernatural abilities, physical statistics, Fortitude and Reflex saves, initiative, and base attack bonus of the primary creature. The physical ability modifiers of the secondary creature are gained as bonuses to the primary creature's physical ability scores (minimum 0, increases to Constitution do not increase hit points as those have already been merged together). At the caster's discretion, the shapeshift applied to the primary creature may be a Blank Transformation, granting it the limbs beyond what the primary creature already possesses as well as the natural attacks and special abilities of the secondary creature in place of other traits. Unless also applying a (transformation) talent to the primary creature to merges its equipment, the amalgamated body gains the equipment of both creatures, but may only wear and benefit from one item per magic item slot as usual, and if both creatures were using an item that requires a slot (for example, both wearing armor), only one of those pieces of equipment can be used, with redundant equipment being merged into the amalgamated body. Both of the base creature's minds remain independent, retaining mental ability scores and Will saves and are capable of taking purely mental actions, but they act on the same initiative. While weapon and armor proficiencies are shared between the two minds, only one mind can control the amalgamated body at a time, and only the feats, skills, and talents of that mind can be accessed. At the start of their turn, if the base creatures do not agree which is to be in control, they may make opposed Will saves to take control of the body that round, but the body is staggered and takes a -4 penalty to Reflex saves and AC from the confusion. Mindless creatures are unable to contest the control of an intelligent creature but two mindless creatures will always contest each other's control when fused. Effects that allow a Will save target the mind currently controlling the body. Ongoing magical effects on the base creatures overlap. Should this ability fail to affect either target (whether by successful save, spell resistance, or other cause), the effect fails. If the amalgamated creature is killed, the effect ends and both creatures die. The appearance of the merged body is mostly determined by the dominant body, but at the caster's discretion its cosmetic appearance may include aspects of the merged creature. If either target creature is suffering the effects of a disease, poison, or ongoing spell effect, the amalgamated body immediately receives a new save at a +4 bonus unless both creatures are under the same effect. If the dominant body possesses immunity to such an effect, the effect is suspended until the fusion ends, though its duration is expended as normal. Ability damage, drain, or penalty to the physical statistics of the dominant body are retained, but those to mental ability scores continue to affect each creature individually. When this effect ends, any hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, or other such penalty incurred is split evenly between the two creatures (round up). If this damage would be sufficient to reduce either creature to death, that creature is instead reduced to 1 hit point above its death threshold and is stable, with the excess damage transferred to the other creature. If the transferred damage would kill that creature, then both creatures are reduced to 1 hit point above their death threshold and are stable. If it would reduce any ability score below 0, or 1 in the case of Constitution, or if the creature does not have that ability score (such as undead and constructs lacking a Constitution score), any excess is transferred to the other creature, to a minimum of 0, or 1 in the case of Constitution. Any spell effects, poisons, diseases, or other effects that affected the amalgamated creature continue to affect both creatures, but durations are halved and any subsequent saves are made at a +4 bonus. If the space available at the end of this effect cannot accommodate both creatures, they may make opposed Will saves. The loser is shunted to the nearest empty space, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet of solid material it passes through.\"\n",

Archetypes Specializing in Alteration \\n Apex Shifter \\n The Apex Shifter is a Shifter who specializes in changing into different forms using the Alteration sphere. \\n Battleshifter  [CS] \\n Battleshifters are Sages who specialize in changing themselves mid-battle. \\n Beast Bender  [CS] \\n Beast Benders are Hunters who specialize in transforming themselves and their animal allies. \\n Beastsoul Monk \\n The Beastsoul Monk is an archetype for the Monk that focuses on a more primal transformation style. While not actually a caster, they gain the Transformation feat, the ability to flurry with natural attacks, and the ability to use their ki to power their transformations. It is compatible with both the standard and unchained versions of the Monk. \\n Champion of the Cause  [CS] \\n Champions of the Cause are Paladins who can gain powerful, unique bonds or transformations. \\n Experimentalist \\n The Experimentalist is an archetype for the Thaumaturge that focuses on creating alchemic brews and harvesting parts of dead creatures for power. \\n Protean \\n The Protean is an archetype for the Shifter, built around a power that lets it access transformation talents the user hasn't learned. Unsurprisingly, it's best for chaos-aligned characters. \\n Resizer \\n The Resizer is an archetype for the Mageknight that focuses on growing and shrinking at-will. While somewhat limited at first, this ability quickly becomes flexible enough to let the Resizer adjust to changing situations. \\n Warshifter \\n The Warshifter is an archetype for the Shifter that makes use of the Path of War rules (from Dreamscarred Press), and is the first class to combine Spherecasting and Martial Traditions. They are notably less capable at transforming than other Shifters (although Warshifters are still better than non-Shifters at using this Sphere), but have the added utility of martial powers to make up for it.

A significant number of creatures with change shape and other similar polymorph abilities can be affected by these checks. If the polymorph effect targeted is from the Core Pathfinder Magic system, treat the MSD as the Caster Level + 11. If the effect is granted by a supernatural ability with no listed caster level, treat the creature's HD as their caster level, making their MSD equal to 11 + their HD. Creature Types and Form Talents Throughout this site, various abilities require correlating creature types and subtypes to their respective form talents. The table below connects various creature types to the appropriate talent. In the case of the animal and magical beast types, general descriptions of their forms are used in the absence of defined subtypes to better match the available talents. Note that there may be specific cases where an unusual creature fits poorly with the form granted by the talent corresponding to its type. In these cases it is up to the GM to discern the most suitable talent.

They do not gain the +10 bonus to Disguise checks, nor do they lose their abilities, equipment, natural attacks, or any other aspect of their unaltered form. The Blank Form allows a caster to add traits to a creature without fundamentally changing the target first. A caster may grant the following traits to a creature affected by their shapeshift. A target must possess the appropriate limb where listed, and cannot grant a natural attack to a limb that already possesses a natural attack. Darkvision  60 ft \\n Low-light vision \\n 2 claw attacks  (Primary attacks, 1d4, 1d3 small, requires arms).

This grants the target a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. This trait may only be applied to the Blank Form, as such changes are assumed with other forms.

Spending a move action removing the acid stops the additional damage. \\n Gibbering:  All creatures within 30 ft. of the target take a -2 penalty on concentration checks. This penalty increases by 1 per 5 caster levels. \\n Many Eyes:  The target cannot be flanked. \\n Mucus:  The target gains the ability to release a mucus cloud with a radius of 5 ft. +5 ft. per 5 caster levels that persists for 1 round per caster level unless dispersed by a strong wind. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that comes in contact with the cloud must make a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 HD + Constitution modifier or become unable to breathe air but can breath underwater for 1 round per caster level or until they spend a standard action removing the mucus. A creature unable to breathe air that remains out of water begins to suffocate. \\n Roper Strands:  The target gains a roper strand. This trait may be granted multiple times, granting an additional roper strand per additional trait. As a standard action, (or full-round action if using multiple strands), the target may launch their strands, making one ranged touch attack per strand at a target within Close range. Each strands clings to the target, causing 1 Strength damage each round they remain attached (increasing by 1 die size per 5 caster levels; i.e. 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). A Fortitude save (10 + 1/2 HD + Con modifier) negates this damage for the round. A creature cannot be affected more than once per round. Strands have an HP, and Hardness equal to the effect's caster level, and a break DC, escape artist DC, and AC equal to 10 + the effect's caster level. However, strands are instantly severed by any slashing damage, which bypasses its hardness automatically. Creatures connected by roper strands may not move away from each other, though may choose to move closer or laterally. Moving farther requires severing the strand with an attack, breaking it with a strength check, or removing it with an escape artist check, or succeeding on a drag combat maneuver against the target they are connected to. When two targets are connected by a strand, they may make drag combat maneuver checks against each other at range without provoking attacks of opportunity. If a strand is broken, the target instantly regrows the strand, and may still make strand attacks.\"\n",

Archetypes Specializing in Alteration - Old Apex Shifter The Apex Shifter is a Shifter who specializes in changing into different forms using the Alteration sphere. - Old Beastsoul Monk The Beastsoul Monk is an archetype for the Monk that focuses on a more primal transformation style. While not actually a caster, they gain the Transformation feat, the ability to flurry with natural attacks, and the ability to use their ki to power their transformations. It is compatible with both the standard and unchained versions of the Monk. - Old Experimentalist The Experimentalist is an archetype for the Thaumaturge that focuses on creating alchemic brews and harvesting parts of dead creatures for power. For those bothered by this flavor but interested in the power, the archetype also includes suggestions on a less cannibalistic setup. - Old Protean The Protean is an archetype for the Shifter, built around a power that lets it access transformation talents the user hasn't learned. Unsurprisingly, it's best for chaos-aligned characters. - Old Resizer The Resizer is an archetype for the Mageknight that focuses on growing and shrinking at-will. While somewhat limited at first, this ability quickly becomes flexible enough to let the Resizer adjust to changing situations. - Old Warshifter The Warshifter is an archetype for the Shifter that makes use of the Path of War rules (from Dreamscarred Press), and is the first class to combine Spherecasting and Martial Traditions. They are notably less capable at transforming than other Shifters (although Warshifters are still better than non-Shifters at using this Sphere), but have the added utility of martial powers to make up for it.

However, if using the lycanthrope template, or using other creatures with the change shape ability such as the skinwalker race, the Alteration sphere is less than ideal. While a werewolf shifter appears synergistic and thematic on the surface, both change shape and Alteration's shapeshift are polymorph effects. As a creature can only be under a single polymorph effect at one time, which means that a creature with a racial change shape ability will find their options somewhat limited. It is recommended then that such creatures be allowed to treat their change shape forms as if they were the creatures normal form, applying traits according to their casting ability. Applying traits this way still requires the normal casting time, concentration, duration, and spell point costs that a use of shapeshift would entail. Essentially, you treat the change shape form as if it were the creature's base form for Blank Form. You of course can still apply different forms, applying the polymorph rules as normal for determining what effect supersedes the other.\"\n",

      "            \"benefits\": \"As shapeshift as well as other abilities interact with the disguise skill frequently, a moment should be taken to detail how abilities interact with the factors affecting Disguise check DCs. The base Alteration sphere shapeshift ability grants a +10 untyped bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a different race, gender, or species, provided the proper form is applied, though you cannot assume the form of a specific individual without the Perfect Imitation talent. The base ability also does not provide for producing clothing; a non-humanoid creature assuming a humanoid form may have some difficulty infiltrating society without pants, though the Perfect Imitation talent provides a way around this. Refer to the Form Talent/Creature Type table in Section 2 for a guide as to what talents correspond to different creature types. Obviously there is not a penalty for making Disguise checks without a disguise kit when using shapeshift. While you may have the shape of the creature you wish to imitate, this does not confer knowledge of speech patterns, posture, or other subtle cues that could alert others to your deception, thus the various modifiers for being disguised as another race, gender, or age still apply, however assuming the correct size with your shapeshift will eliminate the -10 penalty for being the wrong size.

      "            \"benefits\": \"Since armor merges when under polymorph effects, relying on it while using the Alteration sphere beyond Blank Form is problematic. One option, available to anyone, is to craft or purchase armor with the  wild property , allowed to apply to the Alteration sphere's shapeshift per Spheres of Power. The armorist can add wild to the list of available armor properties by taking the new arsenal trick, Wild. While any creature can simply don armor appropriate to their shape after transforming, the limited duration of shapeshift makes this solution problematic barring the Permanent Transformation advanced talent, the Transformation feat, or the shifter's class features. Once the shapeshift effect ends, armor donned while shifted that does not fit the base form falls off in the creature's square. Other items that may have been equipped during the transformation may be retained or fall off as the GM deems appropriate. For example, a headband may be retained, but rings and gloves on an extra set of arms would fall to the ground. As usual, equipping multiple items that occupy the same magic item slot does not grant additional benefits. Shifters can take the Barding bestial trait, available with 14 class levels. The armorist has a two additional ways to mitigate the armor issue with varying degrees of preparation and cost. Once able to summon armor, a polymorphed armorist can simply summon armor in the form of armor or barding appropriate to their current shape. This has the advantage of working for any shape, but if you change shape again new armor will have to be summoned. If focusing primarily on a single form, an armorist capable of binding armor may form their bound armor to suit their preferred form. This provides no benefit in their default form, but in the chosen form they can still benefit fully from the higher enchantment level of bound armor. Additionally, armorists with the symbiotic knight archetype can form their symbiotic armor over any form, reforming it whenever changing shape.\"\n",

      "            \"benefits\": \"When cast on a willing target, consider shapeshift to be harmless. As a harmless effect, creatures normally immune to polymorph effects, such as undead and constructs, may still benefit from it without further talents or abilities required. Adaptation No expansion to the Alteration sphere could comprehensively cover the bewildering variety of unusual abilities and shapes found just in the animal kingdom, not even considering the range of unique abilities belonging to magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, aberrations, and outsiders that have been published. Attempting to make a unique talent for every possible combination required to represent individual creatures would thus be excessive. The talents included here are intended to cover broad categories and allow the players to fill in specific details by adding traits appropriate to the desired form rather than to give a form for every possible creature. Additionally, excessive overlap between talents has been avoided where possible. However, there will be instances that a particular creature needs to be emulated and the existing talents do so poorly or inefficiently. Perhaps a player wants to have a peculiar form of lycanthropy for their character or the GM has a particular concept suited to a custom world. In cases like these, it is entirely reasonable to create new talents to suit the situation. Careful attention should be given to the suite of abilities for any new form, comparing them to existing forms to weigh cost and strength. The duck-billed platypus will serve as a fair demonstration, as few creatures have such an unusual set of abilities. Using existing talents, neither animalistic transformation nor aquatic transformation fit well, the first being rather too speedy, the second lacking appropriate limbs, and both giving extra abilities that are not desired. A quadruped base form with reduced speed and lacking scent and a bite attack would be a place to start. Add on a swim speed and a unique secondary natural attack than can deliver a poison should get you about where you want to be, resulting in something like this: Platypus Transformation \\nYou may grant the form of a duck-billed platypus with your shapeshift. The form has a head, tail, and 4 legs with all the benefits of being a quadruped. The target gains a 20 ft. land speed and a 20 ft. swim speed. The target also gains poised barbs on its hind legs, acting as a secondary natural attack (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, piercing damage) with Poison (Injury) DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Constitution Modifier, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, 1d2 Constitution damage, cure 1 save. In addition, you may grant the following traits to any form: Swim: A swim speed as granted by the Platypus form. \\n Barbs: Barb natural attack (secondary 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, piercing) Another example would be a bat (or dire bat or bat-like magical beast). Avian form is not quite right, so swapping out the two talon attacks for a bite attack and giving darkvision in place of low-light vision is a fairly simple change. Granting blindsight or blindsense, however, would require a spell point to be spent. Compare to the Blindfolded Oracle talent of the Divination sphere, which requires a spell point and closing your eyes, though it has a longer duration. A giant worm, for another example, could be modeled using the constrictor package of Serpentine transformation, then reduce the land speed, remove the climb speed and low light vision, and add a burrow speed and tremorsense. Tremorsense and a burrow speed are often going to be more useful than low light vision and a climb speed, so removing constrict as well should get you to a reasonable spot. Some creatures are difficult to model within the constraints of a single talent. For example, griffons have a fly speed, pounce, three natural attacks and rake. They are suitably simulated with Animalistic Transformation for the base form, then adding wings and additional attacks and abilities via other talents. While this works well enough, it makes simulating a griffon difficult in the early levels. Obviously handing out flight at level one without cost can create issues, but allowing a character to have cosmetic wings or talons, granting no mechanical effect, can help them to seem closer to the goal than otherwise possible. Characters taking the Transformation feat for unusual or powerful animals, if unable to fit them well into existing talents or comparable new talents, are advised to go this route until they are able to gain the Improved Transformation feat enough times to achieve their goal. Choosing mechanics that get you as close as possible and then changing the way they are described is fully encouraged.\"\n",

Casting a blood art is a standard action, unless otherwise stated, and has a range of close. As part of casting any blood art, either the caster's or the target's blood is briefly manipulated, causing that creature to suffer a small amount of damage known as \\\"blood loss\\\". Blood loss is inflicted on the creature whose blood is manipulated by a blood art in addition to but separate from any of the blood art's normal effects. A creature who suffers blood loss takes untyped damage equal to 1/2 the blood art caster's Blood sphere caster level (minimum 1). This damage cannot be prevented and bypasses any temporary hit points the target may possess. A creature who cannot suffer blood loss cannot be the target of a blood art. Targets that gain immunity to bleed damage from their creature type, subtype, or a template cannot suffer blood loss. Creatures that gain immunity to bleed damage from other sources are susceptible to blood loss, but still benefit from their immunity against bleed damage. Some creatures that are normally immune to bleed damage but that frequently feed on blood may be susceptible to blood loss. Any creature that has used the blood drain universal monster ability in the previous hour or any creature composed largely of blood (such as a blood golem) may suffer blood loss. Other appropriate creatures may also suffer blood loss, at the GM's discretion. Author's Note: \\\"What Exactly Is Blood Loss\\\" Blood loss is an additional \\\"cost\\\" associated with a blood art. It is damage, but it is not the sphere effect's damage. It cannot be modified, increased or interacted with like a sphere effect's regular damage or effects. Metamagic contingent on an effect dealing damage to a target, such as the Dazing Spell metamagic, would not consider or treat the blood loss mechanic as the sphere effect's damage.

The drum that keeps all living creatures functional is an instrument you know how to outplay. As a (still) ability, you may temporarily strip a creature of the need for blood to allow them to keep living. As an immediate action made when a willing creature under your blood control would be slain or knocked unconscious by hit point damage, you can cause that creature to ignore the need for blood by spending 3 spell points. For one round, that creature cannot be slain by hit point damage, cannot suffer ability damage or drain to their Constitution, Dexterity or Strength scores and does not fall unconscious for having negative hit points. However, in this state, the creature treats their Constitution score as if it were 1, suffers a -4 penalty to their armor class, and all temporary hit points they would gain are reduced to 0. After this ability expires, at the start of the target's next turn, they must succeed at a Fortitude save against a DC of 15 + the amount of negative hit points below their death threshold (the number of negative hit points they may have before dying of hit point damage) or immediately die. If they succeed, the creature falls unconscious with a number of negative hit points equal to their death threshold plus one. As this ability is extremely taxing on a creature's body to use, attempting to use this ability on a creature more than once every 24 hours automatically fails. As a (still) ability, you may spend two spell points to stop a creature's heart entirely. At the beginning of that creature's turns, they must succeed at a Fortitude save (the creature suffers a -4 penalty to this saving throw if they are below half their maximum hit points) or be reduced to 1 hit point and become sickened and staggered for the duration of your blood control. If the creature was already at 1 point or lower, they are reduced to -1 hit points and fall unconscious. If the creature was already unconscious, or at -1 hit points or lower, they instead die. While under the effects of this (still) ability, a creature cannot benefit from healing from sources other than fast healing and regeneration. If a creature succeeds a saving throw against this ability, the creature no longer needs to attempt new Fortitude saves at the beginning of their turn. As a (quicken) ability, as a standard action, you can rapidly accelerate a creature's heartbeat to the point it can explode by spending one spell point. If the target possesses any temporary hit points, they must succeed at a Fortitude save or otherwise have all of their temporary hit points removed, and afterwards suffer bludgeoning damage equal to the amount of temporary hit points that were removed. If a creature has a combined total of temporary and current hit points that is greater than their maximum hit points, they suffer a -4 penalty on this save.

Drinking any non-flammable liquid (such as a potion or water) grants the target a +4 bonus to that round's saving throw. This fire is not extinguished if the target submerges itself; it is internal. If you possess the Nature sphere (fire) package, you may spend an additional spell point to cause the burning damage the target suffers each round to be equal to the largest fire you can create with create fire, if it would be larger. \\n Freeze Veins (blood art):  You rapidly freeze the target's blood, making it harder for them to move. On a failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss, takes cold damage equal to your caster level, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. While staggered by this effect, the target becomes unnaturally brittle. Whenever they fall prone, suffer falling damage, or take bludgeoning damage, they take an additional amount of cold damage equal to 1/2 your casting ability modifier. Each round the target may attempt another Fortitude save to warm themselves up. If you possess the Nature sphere (water) package, you may spend an additional spell point to cause the target to be unable to take a 5-foot step while staggered by this effect.\"\n",

This bleed damage may be stopped with a DC 15 heal check or any amount of healing. \\n \\n \\n 5 \\n The caster takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain (or Charisma drain, if the caster has no Constitution score) and a blood elemental is created in an adjacent space. This elemental is of the largest size possible based on caster level and serves the caster. This elemental remains for 1 minute per caster level and does not count against the total hit dice of blood elementals the caster may control. \\n \\n \\n 6 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, whenever the caster spends a spell point, he takes bleed damage equal to half his Hit Dice for a number of rounds equal to caster level. This bleed damage may be stopped with a DC 15 heal check or any amount of healing. \\n \\n \\n 7 \\n (Combat) All creatures hostile within 60 ft. of the caster begin taking bleed damage equal to caster level.

Multiple sources of this damage do not stack. \\n \\n \\n 10 \\n All allied creatures within 30 ft. of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or dissolve into a puddle of blood until the start of their next turn. In this form, they gain immunity to bludgeoning, electricity, piercing, and slashing damage, gain vulnerability to cold and fire damage, and are only able to take mental-only actions. Such creatures have no control over their movement or form and will flow as a liquid to the lowest available point if not on a flat surface, moving at a rate of 20 ft. per round. \\n \\n \\n 11 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the ground within 30 ft. of the target or center of the target area becomes covered in sticky blood, creating difficult terrain. \\n \\n \\n 12 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all susceptible hostile creatures within 30 ft. of the caster begin bleeding around their eyes, imposing a 20% miss chance.

Creatures on the pillar must succeed on a concentration check with a DC of 15 + caster level to cast a spell or perform any task requiring concentration. At the end of this result's effect, creatures unable to fly fall, taking falling damage according to the pillar's height. Creatures may move off the pillar if they succeed on a Reflex save but count as starting from prone. \\n \\n \\n 18 \\n For 1 round per caster level, all creatures within 120 ft. of the caster that take bleed damage have their blood turn black. Any bleed damage they take becomes negative energy damage. \\n \\n \\n 19 \\n The caster becomes immune to blood control for 1 minute per caster level; any ongoing blood control effects on the caster end immediately. \\n \\n \\n 20 \\n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 21 \\n The caster takes 1d4 Constitution damage and emits a wave of blood that bullrushes all creatures within 20 ft. directly away, with a CMB equal to caster level + CAM.

Any SP spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, blood rains down in a 60 ft. radius around the caster. This thick red rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 ft. away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). In addition, the ground within this area becomes slick, and counts as difficult terrain. \\n \\n \\n 33 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 34 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the caster's eyes begin bleeding, blinding the caster.

The caster may chose the direction of this line. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. \\n \\n \\n 36 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, an enormous mosquito swarm covers a 120 ft. radius around the caster. This swarm has the statistics of a normal mosquito swarm, but has hit points equal to caster level x 10. The swarm remains stationary. \\n \\n \\n 37 \\n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of his choice from this sphere for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 38 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster is sickened whenever within 30 ft. of a creature taking bleed damage. \\n \\n \\n 39 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all susceptible creatures within 30 ft. of the caster begin bleeding around their eyes, imposing a 20% miss chance. This blood can be wiped away as a move action, removing the miss chance until the end of the creature's turn. \\n \\n \\n 40 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 41 \\n For 1 hour, any creature that is slain within 120 ft. of the caster explodes in a shower of gore. Any creature with 30 ft. of the slain creature is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. Individual creatures can only be affected by this result once per 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n As an instantaneous effect, all water within 400 ft. of the caster is turned to blood. \\n \\n \\n 43 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster is pursued by a mosquito swarm. This swarm appears adjacent to the caster and attempts to enter the caster's space to the best of its ability. \\n \\n \\n 44 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster becomes a blood elemental. Treat this as the water elemental option of the Alteration sphere's Elemental Transformation, with the addition of the blood construct's absorb blood ability. No additional Alteration sphere traits may be added to this effect. This is a polymorph effect. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n As an instantaneous effect, all drops of blood within 30 ft. of the caster transforms into a spider. A swarm of spiders is created sharing the space of every creature within this radius that is suffering bleed damage, below half hit points and not immune to bleed damage, or that has died in the past hour and was not immune to bleed damage. \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all susceptible allied creatures within 30 ft. of the caster begin bleeding around their eyes, imposing a 20% miss chance. This blood can be wiped away as a move action, removing the miss chance until the end of the creature's turn. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, a mist of blood as per the Red Mist talent cover an area within 60 ft. of the caster. This result follows the caster. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, all blood within 400 ft. of the caster glows. Creatures susceptible to blood control shed light as a candle. Creatures suffering from bleed damage shed light as a torch. Anyone attempting to follow the trail of a creature suffering bleed damage gain a +10 circumstance bonus to their survival check to track as long as the trail is within this area. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n (Combat) The caster is dazed for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, whenever the caster takes slashing or piercing damage originating from a creature within 20 ft., that creature must succeed on a Reflex save or a blinded by the spray of blood. This blindness continues until the creature spends a standard action or two move actions wiping it away. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n For 1 round per caster level the caster's blood becomes highly acidic, dealing 1 acid damage per caster level per round. If the caster is suffering bleed damage, all adjacent creatures and objects suffer this acid damage as well.

In this form, they gain immunity to bludgeoning, electricity, piercing, and slashing damage, gain vulnerability to cold and fire damage, and are only able to take mental-only actions. Such creatures have no control over their movement or form and will flow as a liquid to the lowest available point if not on a flat surface, moving at a rate of 20 ft. per round. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n The caster makes a single magical skill check against all Blood sphere effects within medium range to dispel them as if using the Counterspell feat. This is resolved after the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all weapon attacks made within 60 ft. of the caster deal additional bleed damage equal to 1/4 caster level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any other bleed damage they may deal. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n For 1 round per caster level, all bleed damage within 30 ft. of the caster is doubled. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the ground within 30 ft. of the caster becomes covered in sticky blood, creating difficult terrain. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n The caster makes a single magical skill check against all Blood sphere effects within medium range to dispel them as if using the Counterspell feat.

This elemental remains for 1 minute per caster level and does not count against the total hit dice of blood elementals the caster may control. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the caster leaves a trail of blood. This trail gives a +5 circumstance bonus to any creature attempting to track the caster. This bonus is doubled if the creature possesses the scent ability. Additionally, the blood trail may attract predatory creatures as appropriate to the environment. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n For 1 round per caster level, a mist of blood as per the Red Mist talent cover an area within 60 ft. of the target or center of the target area. Any creature that enters or starts its turn within this area takes 1 fire damage per caster level. This result remains stationary. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the ground within 30 ft. of the caster becomes covered in blood, causing all creatures within this area to slip as per the Slick talent. This effect moves with the caster. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster experiences a rush of empowered blood, gaining a +10 circumstance bonus to all non-magical movement speeds. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n The effect fails and the action is lost.

This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster takes a -1 bonus to attack rolls and caster level while taking bleed damage. This penalty increases by -1 for every 5 character levels. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster's blood thickens, reducing any bleed damage taken by half but imposing a -10 ft. penalty on all movement modes and a -2 penalty on Reflex saves, Dexterity checks, and Dexterity-based skill checks. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all creatures within 100 ft. of the caster take a -1 penalty to attack rolls and caster level while taking bleed damage.

This effect automatically ends after 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all hostile creatures within 100 ft. of the caster gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and caster level while taking bleed damage.

This has no mechanical effect. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points within this area that would be susceptible to the caster's blood control has a 10 ft. radius around their space filled with blood, making it difficult terrain. This difficult terrain lasts for the duration of this result. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n All ongoing bleed damage within 60 ft. of the caster immediately stops as if targeted by the coagulate (still) ability. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n As an instantaneous effect, any creature currently under the effects of a disease, poison, or potion and suffering from bleed damage immediately has the disease, formulae, potion, or poison effects end as the cause is drawn from its blood. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n The casting time decreases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n For 1 round per caster level, a mist of blood as per the Red Mist talent cover an area within 60 ft. of the target or center of the target area.

Gathering sufficient blood, one vial's worth, requires inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage to a willing or helpless creature as a full-round action. When used as an additional spell component, the save DC of the spell or sphere effect is increased by +1 per vial used (to a maximum of +4) against the creature whose blood was used, though any other creatures making a save against the spell or sphere effect has the DC reduced by an equal amount. When used as a focus component, the duration of any Divination sphere effect or spell of the Divination school that would locate or contact the creature whose blood is used has its duration doubled per the Extend metamagic feat and its area increased as the Widen Spell metamagic feat, if applicable. These increases stack with the increases from those metamagic feats. Alternatively, the caster may reduce the casting time of such a spell or sphere effect by 1 step, to a minimum of 1 round. Blood does not last indefinitely, losing its potency after 1d6 hours. A successful DC10 Heal check made as a full-round action can determine the number of hours remaining. Particularly hot conditions may reduce this time, while particularly cold ones may extend it, at the GM's discretion. The most common method for preserving a sample of blood is placing it in a vial prepared with a small dose of unguent of timelessness (a vial of unguent of timelessness is sufficient to prepare 75 vials). This is sufficient to preserve the sample for 1 year. Pre-prepared vials may be purchased for 3 gp. Once used, the vial is a normal glass vial with no special properties.\"\n",

Adaptation While the Conjuration sphere provides a wide variety of options for creating the companion that fits your concept, not every conceivable possibility can be anticipated by the author nor fit into print. In cases where a concept doesn't fit readily into existing talents, GMs are encouraged to work with their players to modify existing talents and create new ones. Generally, existing base forms, companion archetypes, and talents should be used as guidelines. Taking a base form and replacing one type of natural attack with another, say trading out a bite attack for a pair of claws that use damage dice one step lower. While having two attacks is better than one, the claws are also subject to the limbs to which they are attached being needed for shields, weapons, holding other objects, casting spells, or other activities. As a more involved example, let's say that a player wants to have a companion based on a marilith. Neither the biped not the serpentine base forms are quite right. While taking the serpentine base form and using the Additional Limbs talent from Spheres of Power would allow you to get there, doing so requires several talents, which may be beyond the investment reasonable at low level. Instead, we can make a new base form, starting from the serpentine base. Serpentine:   Size  Medium;  Speed  20 ft.;  AC  +4 natural armor;  Saves  Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good);  Attack  bite (1d6), tail slap (1d6);  Ability Scores  Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11 Serpentine creatures are snakes, fish, and other elongated creatures. They begin with a head, but no arms or legs. Adding a pair of arms is worth about a talent, per Additional Limbs, so we will start by removing the bite attack and giving it a pair of arms. Now since this is a base form, granting three pairs of fully functional arms would be potentially problematic. However, we can still keep the appearance by allowing the form to have three pairs of arms, but treat them as one set mechanically. Base statistics can shuffled as well. As the marilith is stronger than it is dextrous, we will swap the Strength and Dexterity starting scores. We will also swap the good Will save for a good Fortitude save to better reflect the monster's stat. That gets us pretty close. Down the road, the Additional Limbs talent can be used to make the extra arms function mechanically while other talents can fill in resistances, weapon proficiencies, and size, reflecting the increased power of the summoner's connection with his companion. This should line up reasonably well with other base forms. You end up with: Echidna:   Size  Medium;  Speed  20 ft.;  AC  +4 natural armor;  Saves  Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad);  Attack  tail slap (1d6);  Ability Scores  Str 16, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11 Echidna creatures are suitable for lamias, mariliths, merfolk, and other, similar creatures. An echidna creature begins with a head, a pair of arms, a tail, and no legs. An echidna creature has no legs and may not be tripped unless gaining legs from another source. Similarly, a scorpion could start with the vermin base form and replace the bite attack with a pair of claws (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small, piercing and slashing), possible sacrificing the climb speed for a tail with a stinger (secondary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small, piercing). Additional (form) talents may also be created, though particularly powerful abilities may increase the cost to summon the companion. Powerful abilities like attacks that deal ability drain or damage would be a good example of an ability that should carry an additional spellpoint cost. Conjuration-Focused Archetypes Old Alter-Ego The Alter-Ego is an archetype for the Vigilante that allows them to swap places with a summoned entity. Old Awakener The Awakener is an archetype for the Armiger that allows them to call up the spirits of their weapons. (Requires  Spheres of Might ) Old Knight-Summoner The Knight-Summoner is an archetype for the Mageknight that allows them to call forth a mount, whether it's a celestial horse, a mechanical platform, or a beast from the depths of the world. Old Pact Master The Pact Master is an archetype for the Thaumaturge that trades normal casting power for the ability to summon and gain power from other companions. Combos well with the spirit ideas of  Pact Magic . Old Twinsoul Elementalist The Twinsoul Elementalist is an Elementalist that creates and commands a splinter of themselves that manifests as elemental power. Old Void Wielder The Void Wielder is an Armorist that siphons the very souls of their enemies, then calls them forth to do battle. Wild Magic\"\n",

      "            \"benefits\": \"Prerequisites:  Conjuration sphere, caster level 1st. You may call beings from other planes and bring them into your own. Calling a creature in this manner takes 10 minutes of focused casting and costs 2 spell points. Calling takes one of two forms: allies and hostiles. If you call a servant of an extraplanar being with which you have a strong connection (i.e., a cleric calling a servant of its god) they are considered an ally. All other creatures are considered hostiles, regardless of their disposition towards the caster. GMs have the final say in whether or not a character is capable of calling allies. To call a target, you must choose a location within close range for them to appear, and the kind of creature to be called must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name. You may call multiple creatures with one use of this ability (up to 3 at once) but the Hit Dice of a single creature cannot exceed your MSB, while the combined Hit Dice of all creatures cannot exceed your caster level. Allies:  Allies are never hostile and do not resist, although additional payment is always expected for their services. Payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to a quest on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per Hit Die of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per Hit Die. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per Hit Die. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (unlike a companion from the Conjuration sphere that simply returns to its home plane when reduced to 0 hit points, a called creature actually dies when it is killed). However, at the GM's discretion, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment. If an agreement cannot be reached, the ally returns to their home plane immediately. If you are not willing to give the requested payment, but attempt to press the target into service anyway, treat the creature as hostile. Pressing a creature in this way may have a detrimental effect on any future attempts to call an allied outsider. Hostiles:  If a hostile creature is unwilling to be called, it is allowed a Will saving throw to resist. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is not called. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately called (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). When a hostile creature is called, it is rooted to a specific location within range (you can decide how much space to give it, up to a 30-foot radius). It cannot leave this area until an agreement with you has been reached. It can escape this location by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your magic skill check, by teleportation or dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check pitted against a DC of your MSD + your Charisma modifier. It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can do as it pleases, including fleeing, returning to its home plane, or attacking you. If the creature does not break free of its prison, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones re-offered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to dismiss it (a free action so long as it remains trapped). Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the effect remains for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. At the end of its task, or when the bargained duration expires, a called ally returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).\"\n",

The triggering effect does not require concentration for this time.

The second creature is apathetic to both the caster and the original creature and wanders away to spend the duration of the effect performing a harmless activity such as gathering flowers or sweeping the floor in a nearby building. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n For each summoned or called creature, a duplicate creature also appears, identical to the original. Each creature has half their normal maximum hit points.

One creature of the GM's choice native to the selected plane with a CR not exceeding caster level appears out of the rift each round for a 1d6 rounds and attacks the caster and his allies. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n (Combat) All summoned creatures within long range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be dismissed. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n An outsider of an alignment matching the caster's of the GM's choosing is called per the Summoning advanced talent, appearing adjacent to the caster. This creature has Hit Dice equal to the maximum possible for that talent and is not bound or controlled in any way. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n One imp, lantern archon, mephit (any type), or quasit (GM's choice, should be naturally hostile to caster) per caster level is called and appears within close range of the caster. These creatures are not controlled and act according to their natures. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains resistance to fire equal to your caster level. This stacks with any resistance it already possesses. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature glows brightly (per the glow ability of the Light sphere). This counts as a glow originating from the caster. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains resistance to cold equal to your caster level. This stacks with any resistance it already possesses. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 83 \\n The casting time decreases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 84 \\n The caster is exhausted. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n A small elemental is called adjacent to the caster. This elemental is hostile to all creatures and attacks the nearest to the best of its ability. The size of this elemental increases with caster level: CL 5 - medium, CL 10 - large, CL 15 - huge, CL 20 - elder. Roll 1d4 to determine the elemental type, 1 - air, 2 - earth, 3 - fire, 4 - water. \\n \\n \\n 87 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature loses 1 hit point per round. This cannot reduce the creature below 1 hit point. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n The summoned or called creature refuses to remain in any space not adjacent to an ally of the caster chosen randomly at the time the effect is cast. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains alignment subtypes for all alignments. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n The caster takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains vulnerability to fire. \\n \\n \\n 93 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature is invisible to the caster's allies. The caster is unaffected. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains vulnerability to electricity. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n The summoned or called creature is two sizes smaller than normal, per the Altered Size (form) talent, to a minimum size of Fine. This may decrease the companions size beyond the limits of Altered Size, granting an additional -2 Strength and +2 Dexterity per additional size category. \\n \\n \\n 96 \\n The creature closest to the caster must succeed on a Will save or be merged with the summoned or called creature for 10 minutes per caster level. The affected creature retains all mental ability scores, feats, base saving throw bonuses, and class abilities but uses the physical body (including physical ability scores, extraordinary abilities, hit points, and all abilities derived from (form) talents) of the summoned or called creature. The summoned or called creature does not retain any feats or casting ability it would have and the affected creature does not retain any extraordinary or supernatural abilities derived from race, template, or other sources other than classes and feats. \\n \\n \\n 97 \\n The summoned or called creature is staggered until banished, dismissed, or slain. \\n \\n \\n 98 \\n The summoned or called creature is distrustful of the caster and attempts to resist any effects the caster or the caster's allies use on it and does not benefit from flanking or aid another bonuses from the caster or the caster's allies. \\n \\n \\n 99 \\n The summoned or called creature and the caster are empathically linked. Any time the companion receives damage, the caster takes half that amount of nonlethal damage regardless of distance. Apply the target's damage reduction, immunity, and resistance prior to splitting the damage. The transferred damage bypasses all damage reduction, resistance, and immunity. \\n \\n \\n 100 \\n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains resistance to nonlethal equal to your caster level. This stacks with any resistance it already possesses. Gamemastering\"\n",

While the Conjuration sphere offers interesting options for solo campaigns, letting a single character cover numerous other roles, the more standard group campaign requires different considerations. The simplest expedient is not allowing a player to have a large number of companions summoned simultaneously. A gentleman's agreement with the GM and other players to either not take Extra Companion frequently or to not summon more than one or two at a time is an obvious solution. Specializing your companions for different situations and only summoning them when needed, such as summoning a rogue-like companion to check for traps, then dismissing it to summon a more battle focused companion before setting an ambush, reduces the number of bodies on the field. Another option is to allow other players to control some of the companions, keeping the other players engaged and active, investing them in the companion's development and wellbeing. The other players could be allowed a degree of latitude to portray a unique personality for the companion, emphasizing that it is a separate intelligence rather than a mere extension of the caster. This should only be done after consulting with the other players, obviously. Be aware that this invites the other players' input in how the companion, and by extension the caster, is built, which may be unwelcome to some players.\"\n",

This limitation bars the companion from striking a creature so warded with any weapons that the companion gains from Conjuration sphere talents. A Conjuration sphere companion is sent home by dispel magic, the Counterspell feat, and similar effects, though may be re-summoned as if the duration of the summon had ended, incurring the normal cost and casting time. If the companion is dismissed, dispelled, or slain, any spells or sphere effects it cast expire immediately (per the summoning descriptor). A Conjuration sphere companion winks out if they enter an antimagic field or similar effect. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the summon. If an antimagic field spell, Spell Ward ward from the Protection sphere, or similar effect is cast in an area occupied by a Conjuration sphere companion that has spell resistance, the caster must make a MSB check against the companion's spell resistance to make it wink out. Natural and weapon attacks originating from Conjuration sphere companions are not normally subject to spell resistance. The Summoning advanced talent, despite its name, has the [calling] descriptor. Thus creatures brought with this talent actually die when they are killed; they do not disappear and reform. Additionally, they may attack creatures warded with the appropriate protection from (alignment) spell, the Hallow word of the Fate sphere, and similar effects normally, can enter antimagic fields and similar effects, and can't be dispelled.\"\n",

Ongoing effects continue to have effect and expend duration while a companion is not summoned. Ability damage, ability drain, and other effects persist while the companion is not summoned.

They obey commands, even if the commands would obviously cause the companion harm, as the worst that can happen is that they vanish to be re-summoned another time. However, the GM may choose to have the companion refuse orders that needlessly cause the companion to suffer, such as ordering it to stand in the campfire (without fire resistance) for no reason. Consistent abuse and being forced to act outside of its desires could, however, lead some companions to breaking their link with the caster. If this were to happen, the caster can form a link with a new companion after resting, transferring (form) talents as appropriate (or retraining them to suit, with GM permission). If the player wishes the relationship between the caster and companion to be coerced or antagonistic, consider having the companion be controlled by the GM, giving the companion more freedom to argue and interpret its orders in ways favorable to its views. Such a relationship can be especially interesting when the caster and companion have significantly opposed views. This should be discussed and agreed upon before such an independent companion is obtained. The process of forming a bond with a Conjuration sphere companion is intentionally left vague. While some companions resemble denizens of the planes, others may be less concrete in their origin. Ghosts, vestiges of cosmic powers, unformed spiritual energy, and the sheer will of the caster can all be valid sources of a companion, each offering differing methods to form a bond. Creatures tied to alignment planes may consent to the bond to increase their patron's influence in the world or to guide the caster toward their alignment and goals, potentially leaving once they feel their goals are sufficiently advanced or that the caster has gone beyond the limits of what they are willing to assist with. More ephemeral sources may simply seek an opportunity to exist in the material world, freely copying their summoner's outlook and ends for the joy of existing. Others may seek out casters whose goals align with their own to aid them, whether for grand cosmic purpose or simple revenge. Companions with a single definite purpose may wish to end the connection once the purpose is served, though they could easily see staying with their (usually mortal) summoner for longer out of obligation or fondness.\"\n",

An object reduced to less than half its hit points gains the broken condition. Talents marked (alter) grant you new ways to alter objects. Create [Core] As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create a non-magical, unattended object out of vegetable matter such as wood, hemp, or cotton in either your hand or an adjacent square. The object may be of equivalent size to one Small object per caster level (see chart below) and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. When creating an object you may spend an additional spell point to allow that object to persist for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. If the created object is especially large, it must begin in an adjacent square and must be completely contained within Close range. You cannot create items that require mixing, carry special properties, or knowledge you don't possess (alchemical items, rare herbs, the key to a lock you didn't create, etc.). A DC 15 Appraise check reveals the object as a magical fake. Fabricated objects have a lingering magical aura that can be detected as magic, although the objects themselves aren't magical. While simple objects such as candles, folds of cloth, simple furniture, or basic weapons are easy to create; particularly complex objects (mechanics, crossbows, objects with moving parts) require a Craft check made against the object's Craft DC. Failure means the object comes into being broken and unusable. You cannot create an object directly onto a target (summoning manacles onto someone's wrists, etc.). Notes on Walls and Coverings:  A section of 20 ft by 20 ft cloth is considered a Small object. A wall 10 ft by 10 ft and 1 inch thick counts as a Small object. Doubling the thickness counts as doubling the size.

Thus, a casing for a Medium creature is a Large object, a casing for a Large creature is a Huge object, etc. A creature is allowed a Reflex save to escape such an entrapment, and may attack or make Strength checks unimpeded against its own casing. Notes on Falling Objects:  Objects that fall upon characters deal damage based on their size according to  Table: Object Size . Objects made of stone or harder substances deal double damage, while objects such as cloth or water deal half damage. Also, an object falling less than 30 feet also deals half damage, while objects falling more than 150 ft deal double damage. These multipliers stack. A falling object takes the same amount of damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal more than 20d6 damage. Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged touch attack, with a range increment of 20 feet.

These multipliers stack; a stone object falling 150 feet would deal x4 damage, while a cloth object falling 20 feet would deal 1/4th damage. A falling object takes the same amount of falling damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal more than 20d6 falling damage. Additional damage, such as through enhancements, acid coatings, etc., is not multiplied or divided by hardness or falling distance. Dropping an object on a creature is considered an attack with a ranged weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. This distance is measured from the object's starting point to the target's square, rather than the distance between you and the target. When making an attack roll with a falling object, use your Intelligence instead of your Dexterity when calculating your attack bonus. When dropping an object on a target that is larger than the dropped object, make an attack roll against their AC. This is similar to a weapon attack. When dropping an object that is the same size or larger than the target, make an attack roll against their touch AC. This is similar to using an indirect-fire siege weapon, and carries some additional rules: When using a Large or larger object like an indirect-fire siege weapon, the object targets a creature in a square, but also deals half its falling damage as splash damage to additional creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per size category above Large of the object being dropped. When using a dropped object of Medium size or larger like an indirect-fire siege engine, you may target a grid intersection instead of a creature like you can with a splash weapon, in which case direct damage is not dealt and splash damage (if any) affects creatures as normal. Also, like a splash weapon, if you miss with a dropped object, the object veers off course one space per range increment. Roll a d8 to determine the direction in which the object veered off-course, just as with a splash weapon. A dropped, hard, non-wall/covering object larger than the creatures underneath it will push creatures out of the area where it fell to the nearest unoccupied spaces, while objects the same size or smaller would themselves move to the nearest unoccupied spaces. Walls and coverings larger than the objects underneath them function as catches, described below. A dropped soft non-covering object, such as a large bundle of cloth, that is larger than the creatures underneath it neither moves creatures nor becomes a catch, and instead forces the targets to pass a Reflex save or be knocked prone and buried underneath the object itself.\"\n",

A square filled with a gas obscures sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment and creatures further away have total concealment (50% miss chance and attackers cannot use sight to locate the target). If a square is filled with a condensed gas (by treating a single square as a Large object) it obscures vision as above and is difficult to move in, halving movement speed of all creatures within it as well as imposing a -2 penalty to melee attack and damage rolls, preventing normal ranged attacks (siege weapons and magic attacks function normally), and treats anyone standing in a harmful gas as if they were exposed to it twice. (For example, taking double damage from acidic vapors, or two doses of poison from poisonous fumes.) A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses any altered or created gas in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gas in 1 round. Note:  The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed to be a perfect simulation of reality, and attempting to interject real-world physics and chemistry into it is often disastrous.

When creating objects, you may create the object already on fire. Flaming objects deal 1d6 fire damage to any creature who touches the object, such as by having it dropped on them or used as a weapon against them. You may also light the terrain on fire or summon burning materials as a form of hazardous terrain. This behaves and deals damage as a fire created by the Nature sphere instead of as normal for hazardous terrain. A fire that has insufficient fuel quickly burns itself out if not maintained through concentration. In addition, you may spend a spell point to create non-magical electricity. However, with no battery or other way to store electricity, the energy quickly dissipates. Electricity must be generated directly on a creature or object (not simply in a square) and instead of being calculated by size, is instead calculated by its charge, with 1 charge being equal to a Medium object. If used on a battery or other electrical storage object, the charges are stored safely. If used on any other creature or object, it instead deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per charge to the creature or object (Reflex negates). If the creature or object is made from a conductive material such as flesh or metal, targets touching the electrified creature or object (including touching the same body of water) are also affected, but the electricity loses 1d6 for every 10 feet the electricity must travel to reach these targets from the specific square designated as the center of the electricity (for example, if electrocuting a metal floor, all targets touching the floor would be affected, so long as they are close enough the damage is not reduced to 0). The charge deals damage again each round at the beginning of your turn, with the charge reducing by 1 each round. If affecting a creature or their attended objects, they may ground themselves or the object as a move action, harmlessly dissipating any charges that remain. Creating electricity is an instantaneous effect, and you cannot create an object charged with electricity as you can create an object on fire. Repairing plasma restores it to the size (for fire) or stored energy (for electricity) it had in the previous round. This allows a fire to retain its size indefinitely without fuel so long as it is repaired every round. Destroying a plasma reduces its size or stored energy by 1 size category or 1d6 points of damage for every 5 points of damage dealt to it. If you use Change Material to turn an object into a plasma which dissipates entirely before the duration expires, then the object is destroyed when it regains its normal form. Otherwise, when the duration expires, the object reverts to its previous form with no apparent difference or damage that was not preexisting.

The sympathetic link makes the creature immediately aware of the incoming effect and allows them to defend against it without being surprised, even if asleep, though they are not made aware of the magic's precise nature or source. The creature is allowed a Fortitude save to negate the effect regardless of whether the effect would normally allow a save. After conveying magic 1 + 1 time per 10 caster levels, the duplicate crumbles and becomes useless. The first time that such a Fortitude save against this ability succeeds (regardless of if damage or a magic effect is applied), the original creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This link does not function across planes. Whenever a creature is affected by this ability, they know the general direction towards their duplicate. \\n There Can Be Only One:  If the duplicate and the original creature come into physical contact with each other (which can occur when a successful touch attack is made by the duplicate or using the duplicate), the duplicate is instantly destroyed and the original creature takes 1d8 points of untyped damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half).\"\n",

When using this talent your caster level is halved for determining the quantity of material that can be created. Note:  This talent can be unbalancing for a game, and GMs should consider its role in their setting before allowing it to fall into player hands. However, if handled correctly, this talent can lead to interesting interactions between players and setting. For example, the players might flood a market with rare jewels only to find their value plummets as the market floods. This applies to the selling of a mass amount of mithral or adamantine as well. Also remember that towns have a maximum buy value and attempting to sell items that exceed this value cannot be done. Additionally take note of how this talent could affect the world at large outside of PC hands. If many high level Creation casters exist, then normally rare materials might be commonplace in the setting, their rarity long since diminished by industrious casters, or perhaps the materials are not naturally occurring at all and the few mages with the ability to create them charge a fortune for their use, keeping their prices high. This ultimate secret of Creation might even be passed down only among those of a certain order, limiting the talent's availability to a select few, like medieval guilds, with well guarded, secret recipes whose methods could be lost.\"\n",

You may spend 1 spell point to create an alchemical item(up to a maximum value of 25 gp per caster level). This functions exactly as the normal alchemical item except that any DC is 10 + your casting ability modifier + 1/2 your caster level and any damage it deals is increased by your casting ability modifier. These alchemical weapons remain for the normal duration of a created object at which point they disappear as usual. You may also alter mundane alchemical weapons up to a maximum value of 25 gp, enhancing their potency in the same way for the normal duration, at which point the items return to their normal damage and saving throw DC. This does not stack with other effects that increase the item's DC. As your caster level increases, so does your ability to create and sustain more materials. At caster level 5 you may create alchemical items costing up to an additional 25 gp per caster level (a total of 50 gp per caster level). Every 5 caster levels beyond this increases the total value you can create by an additional 25 gp per caster level (75 gp per caster level at 10th, 100 gp per caster level at 15th, and so on). If you possess Divided Creation you may create any number of alchemical weapons whose total value is less than half the maximum value you may create and whose total size is less than or equal to your maximum size (with each alchemical weapon counting as a small object) but only one object created this way increases its saving throw DC and damage, all others retain their base, non-magical statistics. If you possess Plasma Production then any time you create an alchemical weapon that includes a fuse as the method of activating it (such as with a fuse grenade and its variants, or fireworks) you may create it with the fuse pre-lit. This allows you to treat the weapon as if you had used it as provided in its description. (For example, creating a fuse grenade with this option causes the grenade to explode in 1d4 rounds.)\"\n",

Each time, choose another option you haven't taken yet. Classic Substances:  When you create or alter an object, you may work with any non-harmful material with a hardness of 5 or less, including glass, ice, or leather. You may create water (3 cubic ft. equals a Small creature), but not gases or flesh. You may make objects with multiple materials, provided you can create all the materials required. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make steadily more materials, as detailed in the table below. Adamantine cannot be created or altered, except for the repair and destroy abilities. Note:  Objects of stone or harder materials deal double damage when dropped on a target. Note:  Feats and advanced talents found in Spheres of Power which refer to Expanded Materials now refer to Expanded Materials: Classic Substances. Table: Classic Substances Caster Level \\n Materials \\n \\n \\n 1st \\n Stone \\n \\n \\n 5th \\n Basic metals (copper, iron, steel) \\n \\n \\n 10th \\n Precious metals (gold, silver) \\n \\n \\n 15th \\n Specialty metals (cold iron, mithril), gems Acidic Creation:  By spending an additional spell point when you create or alter an object, you may work with material with basic acidic properties. You may create acidic liquids (3 cubic ft. equals a Small creature) or apply an acid coating to a solid object, but may not create gases without Gaseous Generation. When first created, this acid deals 1d6 points of acid damage to any creature or object it touches every round plus 1d6 per 2 caster levels beyond 1st. After 1 round per 2 caster levels the acid will lose potency and only deals its minimum damage. If attached to an object dropped on a target, acid damage is never increased for hardness or distance. If the acid is created in a way that it would immediately harm a creature, they are entitled to a Reflex saving throw to negate the damage (unless the acid is attached to a target dropped onto them, in which case an attack roll is made as usual). If they fail this saving throw and are coated in acid, they may continue to make Reflex saves every round as a move action to clean away the affected areas and prevent further damage. By spending a fullround action that provokes an attack of opportunity they may remove the acid without a saving throw. If you possess Gaseous Generation you may create acidic gases. These follow the rules of Gaseous Generation for determining volume but at 1/2 your normal caster level. This acidic gas deals 1d6 acid damage per round, and an additional 1d6 damage for every four caster levels beyond 1st. When an acidic gas loses its potency it is dispersed entirely. If you possess Lengthened Creation, any acid created using it maintains its potency for 10 minutes per caster level. If you create acid with the Create Materials advanced talent, the acid loses its potency after one week if not refreshed by repeated castings of Create Materials. Gaseous Generation:  By spending a spell point when you create or alter an object, you may work with gaseous materials. You may create gases (5 cubic ft. equals a Medium creature, you may fill a 5 ft. square for every two caster levels. You may fill only half of a cube as a Small creature but this decreases the DC of any created gaseous effect by 2 and halves any damage from harmful gases) or change their composition into any other known substance with Change Material. You must have line of sight to accomplish this, and as such cannot alter the air in a creature's lungs into stone. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make more dangerous gases as detailed in the table below. Vacuums cannot be created or altered, and gases cannot be destroyed by damaging effects. Creatures standing in a square filled with unbreathable air must hold their breath or suffer the effects of suffocation, following the normal rules for doing so. A half-filled square of non-transparent gas obscures sight beyond 10 feet. Any creature behind more than 10 ft. of squares half-filled with a gas has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). A square filled with a gas obscures sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 ft. has concealment and creatures further away have total concealment (50% miss chance and attackers cannot use sight to locate the target). If a square is filled with a condensed gas (by treating a single square as a Large object) it obscures vision as above and is difficult to move in, halving movement speed of all creatures within it as well as imposing a -2 penalty to melee attack and damage rolls, preventing normal ranged attacks (siege weapons and magic attacks function normally), and treats anyone standing in a harmful gas as if they were exposed to it twice. (For example, taking double damage from acidic vapors, or two doses of poison from poisonous fumes.) A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses any created or altered gas in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gas in 1 round. Note:  The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed to be a perfect simulation of reality, and attempting to interject real-world physics and chemistry into it is often disastrous. As such, the gases that may be altered or created have been simplified from what their real world counterparts would be. If you wish to create a more specific gas, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with your GM - its effects should not exceed those of the gases normally available at your caster level. Table: Gaseous Generation Caster Level \\n Gaseous Material \\n \\n \\n 1st \\n Breathable air \\n \\n \\n 5th \\n Unbreathable air, gaseous forms of non-harmful objects (for example, steam, smoke) \\n \\n \\n 10th \\n Non-magical inhaled poisons (using your sphere DC rather than the standard poison DC) \\n \\n \\n 15th \\n Highly flammable gases (1d6 fire damage per ignited 5 ft. cube of gas to all targets within a 20 ft. radius of any ignited cube, Ref half), highly corrosive gases (2d6 acid damage per round of exposure, Fort half) Plasma Production:  You may create or alter a non-magical fire with your normal limitations on size. A fire that has insufficient fuel quickly burns itself out. In addition, you may create or alter non-magical electricity. With no battery or other way to store electricity, however, the energy quickly dissipates. Generating electricity on an object deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels to the object and any creature or object that interacts with it (Reflex negates). Every round thereafter, the electricity deals 1d6 fewer points of damage until it reaches 0, at which point it dissipates entirely. If used on a battery or other electrical storage object, this deals no damage and creates a number of charges equal to the number of dice used for the initial damage. Repairing a plasma restores it to the size (for fire) or stored energy (for electricity) it had in the previous round. This allows a fire to retain its size indefinitely without fuel so long as it is repaired every round. Destroying a plasma reduces its size or stored energy by 1 size category or 1d6 points of damage for every 5 points of damage dealt to it. If you use Change Material to turn an object into a plasma which dissipates entirely before the duration expires, then the object is destroyed when it regains its normal form. Otherwise, when the duration expires, the object reverts to its previous form with no apparent difference or damage that wasn't preexisting.\"\n",

Items which normally cost more than 50 gp should instead have a DC 20 +1 for every 200 gp of its base price. These DCs are subject to GM discretion and should be revised as necessary.

      "            \"benefits\": \"Dropping an object on a creature via the Creation sphere is similar to dropping an object on a creature via a catapult or trebuchet. The following rules are appropriate when handling falling objects. Additional damage such as enhancements bonuses, acid coatings, etc., do not have their damage multiplied or divided by hardness or falling distance. When dropping an object on a target that is at least two sizes bigger than the object, the falling object targets normal AC rather than touch AC. When dropping an object on a target that is no more than one size bigger than the object, the falling object behaves in many ways like a splash weapon, as explained below. In this case, the falling object targets touch AC. When dropping a Large object, the object deals half damage as 'splash damage' to all targets within 5 ft. of the target space (Reflex save negates). This radius increases by 5 ft. for every size category above Large for the falling object. You may target a square instead of a creature (provided the creature inside that square is not at least two sizes bigger than the object), in which case the object deals splash damage to any creature inside that square as well (Reflex negates). If the falling object misses the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the attack, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the caster), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the drop. After determining where the object landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures within the attack area. Creatures 3 or more sizes smaller than the object that fail their saving throw against a falling object's splash damage become buried under the object or its rubble. Treat this as a cave-in with the following adjustments; Buried creatures are pinned, prone, and have full cover so long as they remained buried. As a standard action, a buried creature can attempt to free himself with a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 30 Escape Artist check. Failure by 4 or less reduces cover by 1 step and the DCs by 2. Failure by 5 or more undoes progress, increasing the DCs by 2 but does not restore cover. Each failure stacks. Characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a character falls unconscious, he must make a DC 15 Constitution check each minute. If it fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute until freed or dead. Creatures who have less than improved cover are not buried and have no risk of suffocation but are still pinned until they dig themselves out or are rescued. Characters who aren't buried can dig out their friends. They may make a Strength check as a standard action against a buried target's DC, with the same results on a failure. Alternatively, they may attempt to clear stone slowly and carefully. In 1 minute, using only her hands, a character can clear rocks and debris equal to five times her heavy load limit. The amount of loose stone that fills a 5-ft.-by-5-ft. area weighs 1 ton (2,000 pounds). Armed with an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel, a digger can clear loose stone twice as quickly as by hand.\"\n",

If the caster lacks a shadow, one is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 10 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster suffers a bout of photophobic vertigo, suffering the sickened condition in areas of normal light and the nauseated condition in areas of bright light. \\n \\n \\n 11 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects of the Light sphere or with the light descriptor originating from hostile creatures within long range of the caster have their caster level increased by 1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels of the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 12 \\n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the target or center of the target area for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within partial concealment. Any creature within the effect must succeed on a Reflex save each round or be entangled until the start of their next turn. \\n \\n \\n 13 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 14 \\n The target or creatures in the target area must succeed on a Will save or gain an additional shadow at 180 degrees from their normal shadows for 10 minutes per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 15 \\n Any light source in the possession of the target or creatures in the target area when the effect is cast has its effect on illumination inverted for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 16 \\n A shadow twin of the caster appears adjacent to the caster. This twin possesses all of the caster's abilities and equipment, though only 1 hit point. This twin aids the caster for 1 minute per caster level or until slain. The twin and all its equipment disappear when the twin is slain or the effect expires. Any non-instantaneous effect originating from the twin end when it disappears. \\n \\n \\n 17 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster treats areas of normal or brighter light as if they were solid objects and is unable to enter or pass through such an area, though retains line of effect through such areas. \\n \\n \\n 18 \\n (Combat) The caster is stunned for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 19 \\n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to blind nearby creatures, performing a dirty trick combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Dirty Trick and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 20 \\n The caster takes untyped nonlethal damage equal to caster level. This damage does not force concentration checks to cast or maintain sphere effects or spells. \\n \\n \\n 21 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects of the Light sphere or with the light descriptor cast within long range of the caster have their caster level increased by 1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels of the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 22 \\n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, the caster absorbs all light, appearing perfectly black and is blind. \\n \\n \\n 23 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster gains a 20% miss chance while in areas of less than normal light. \\n \\n \\n 24 \\n The caster is fatigued. \\n \\n \\n 25 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 26 \\n The caster takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \\n \\n \\n 27 \\n Creatures subject to the effect receive the half of any damage the caster receives for the duration of their time subject to the effect. This damage is redirected from the caster, reducing the amount he is damaged by an equal amount. Resistance and immunity apply to this damage. Multiple affected creatures divide this damage equally. \\n \\n \\n 28 \\n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 29 \\n The caster becomes afraid of the light, taking a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects while in areas with greater than dim light for 1 hour per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 30 \\n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 31 \\n Any light source in the caster's possession has its effect on illumination inverted for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n The target or any creature in the area of the effect when it is cast must succeed on a Fortitude save or begin to absorb all light, appearing perfectly black and be blinded for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 33 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster gains the light blindness monster ability. Creatures with light blindness are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. Such creatures are dazzled as long as they remain in areas of bright light. \\n \\n \\n 34 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, all shadows within long range of the caster all lengthened as if exposed to a sunset. \\n \\n \\n 35 \\n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of his choice from this sphere for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 36 \\n The caster becomes blind in any area with greater than dim light for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 37 \\n The caster's shadow attempts to pilfer items from nearby creatures, performing a steal combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level and storing any items successfully stolen in the caster's gear. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Steal and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 38 \\n The caster's shadow takes on a sinister appearance for 10 minutes per caster level, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks but imposing a -2 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. \\n \\n \\n 39 \\n Affected creatures or those within the effect's area receive the caster's casting drawbacks for the duration of their time in the effect or for as long as they are affected by it. \\n \\n \\n 40 \\n The ambient light level with the caster's Dark sphere range is reduced by one step unless this reduction would make it darker than dim light. The effect remains centered on the caster for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 41 \\n Any creature within long range of the caster that is in an area of dim or lower illumination takes 1 point of negative energy damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, all creatures other than the caster can see normally in regular and magical darkness within medium range of the caster. \\n \\n \\n 43 \\n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are lost. \\n \\n \\n 44 \\n (Combat) for 1 round per caster level, the caster becomes an area of darkness. The caster generates an area of darkness in his space as if he had cast darkness. The caster may move with his normal movement speeds, but may not otherwise take any actions other than to change his choice or (darkness) talents active in this area and to concentrate on any ongoing effects. The caster may not be targeted or effected by anything other than effects that would dispel the darkness. Any effect that dispels this darkness causes the caster to reform and take 1d6 points of untyped damage per 2 caster levels of the dispelling effect. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects with the dark descriptor cast within long range of the caster have their caster level increased by 1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels of the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n Darkness sweeps outward from the caster, reducing light levels by 2 steps in a long range emanation for 1 round. Make a single magical skill check and compare it with the MSD of all Light sphere effects in range; success means the Light sphere effect is dispelled as with the Counterspell feat. \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n The caster is exhausted. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n The target or creatures in the target area when the effect is cast must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the see in darkness monster ability for 1 round per caster level but is blind in anything brighter than dim light. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to pilfer items from nearby allied creatures, performing a steal combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level and storing any items successfully stolen in the caster's gear. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Steal and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n For 1d6 rounds, the caster leaves an area of darkness in all squares he has occupied since the start of his last turn. A (darkness) talent may be applied to this effect as normal. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n All creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the light blindness monster ability for 1 minute per caster level. Creatures with light blindness are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. Such creatures are dazzled as long as they remain in areas of bright light. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n The caster gains an additional shadow at 180 degrees from his normal shadow for 10 minutes per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 54 \\n The caster's active Dark sphere effects flicker randomly, having only a 50% chance of functioning each round (rolled immediately and again at the beginning of the caster's turn) for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n The target or creatures in the target area must succeed on a Will save or become blind in any area greater than dim light for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n The caster gains the see in darkness monster ability for 1 minute per caster level. The caster can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by the deeper darkness spell or the Pure Darkness talent. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n Any creature within close range of the target or center of the target area that is in an area of normal or brighter light takes 1 point of untyped damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the caster for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within partial concealment. Any creature within the effect must succeed on a Reflex save each round or be entangled until the start of their next turn. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the caster absorbs all light, appearing perfectly black. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the caster for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within that area partial concealment. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n The caster's shadow gains a color of the GM's choice for 10 minutes per caster level. This tint extends to all Dark sphere abilities originating from the caster during this time but has no other effect. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n The target or creatures in the target area must succeed on a Will save or become blind in any area with less than normal light for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to trip nearby allied creatures, performing a trip combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Trip and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n A shadow twin of the caster appears adjacent to the caster. This twin possesses all of the caster's abilities and equipment, though only 1/2 his hit points and attempts to harm the caster and the caster's allies to the best of its abilities for 1 minutes per caster level or until slain. The twin and all its equipment disappears when the twin is slain or the effect expires. Any non-instantaneous effect originating from the twin end when it disappears. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n The casting time increases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n Any creature within long range of the caster that is in an area of normal or brighter light takes 1 point of untyped damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n The caster casts no shadow for 10 minutes per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n Any creature within long range of the target or center of the target area that is in an area of dim or lower illumination takes 1 point of negative energy damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n The ambient light level with the caster's Dark sphere range is reduced by one step unless this reduction would make it darker than dim light. The effect remains centered on the target or target area for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to blind nearby hostile creatures, performing a dirty trick combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Dirty Trick and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n The caster is unable to detect any creature currently affected by his Dark sphere abilities or spells with the darkness descriptor for 1 round per caster level. This includes special senses such as blindsight and tremorsense. If the caster is included in the effect, the caster cannot see or hear himself, imposing a 25% spell failure chance on any effect requiring somatic or verbal components. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the light blindness monster ability for 1 minute per caster level. Creatures with light blindness are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. Such creatures are dazzled as long as they remain in areas of bright light. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n The caster's shadow attempts to trip nearby creatures, performing a trip combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Trip and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the target or center of the target area for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within partial concealment. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n The target or any creature in the area of the effect when it is cast must succeed on a Fortitude save or begin to absorb all light, appearing perfectly black for 1 hour per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n The caster gains the see in darkness monster ability for 1 round per caster level but is blind in anything brighter than dim light. The creature can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by the deeper darkness spell or the Pure Darkness talent. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects of the Light sphere or with the light descriptor originating from allied creatures within long range of the caster have their caster level reduced by 1.

If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n An area out to long range of the caster is plunged into darkness as the Dark sphere with both the Pure Darkness talent and the Midnight advanced talent. This effect remains stationary and persists for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to pilfer items from nearby hostile creatures, performing a steal combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level and storing any items successfully stolen in the caster's gear. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Steal and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n Creatures other than the caster subject to the effect receive the half of any healing the caster receives for the duration of their time subject to the effect. This healing is redirected from the caster, reducing the amount he heals by an equal amount. Multiple affected creatures divide this healing equally. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n The caster becomes blind in any area with less than normal light for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 93 \\n Any creature that enters a blot or darkness created by the caster benefits from any melds active on the caster for as long as they remain in the effect. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all creatures within areas of dim light or lower within medium range of the caster take half damage from all sources except for force effects as their bodies partially discorporate into living shadow. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n The caster's shadow is animated and immediately absconds with any items held in the caster's hands.

When reanimating piecemeal undead this way, use the statistics of an appropriately sized animated object  with the undead construction flaw and no other construction point abilities or construction flaws. Piecemeal undead otherwise count as an undead creature you reanimated, count against the total number of reanimated creatures you may have active at any one time normally, and obey your commands as normal for an undead you reanimated. A piecemeal undead will usually be anywhere from three sizes smaller to approximately the same size as the original corpse. See Table: Piecemeal Undead to determine the appropriate animated object size for a piecemeal undead. A piecemeal undead is not a skeleton or zombie and cannot be modified by the Expanded Necromancy talent, except as described below. Piecemeal undead do not count as animated objects for the purposes of Enhancement sphere talents, feats, and other abilities. Infuse Piecemeal Undead:  You can grant an intact undead under your control the ability to split off parts of itself to create piecemeal undead as described in the Reanimate Piecemeal Undead ability. As a standard action, or as a free action when reanimating one or more undead, you may spend a spell point to grant one undead within your dominion range the ability to split off a part of itself. If you possess Mass Death Magic, you may spend an additional spell point to grant this ability to 1 additional undead per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). An undead granted the ability to split off a part of itself can spend a full-round action to create a piecemeal undead of an appropriate size to the body part used into an adjacent, unoccupied space (such as a zombie tearing off its own arm or hand, or the skull of a skeleton popping off). You must be able to control the Hit Dice of a piecemeal undead created this way or it fails to be created. Piecemeal undead created this way share the duration of the reanimate effect which initially created the intact undead it was separated from and possesses any properties (including defensive abilities, special abilities, and special attacks) possessed by that undead, subject to GM discretion, but does not increase any existing defensive abilities it would possess as a piecemeal undead (such as damage reduction or natural armor). This can include abilities granted by a variant, such as those from the Expanded Necromancy talent, allowing for a bloody skeleton to separate its arm from itself to create an appropriately sized \\\"bloody\\\" piecemeal undead with the fast healing and deathless qualities from the bloody skeleton variant. Only undead raised from intact corpses, such as those normally available without this talent, can be granted the ability to split with this talent; piecemeal undead can never be granted the ability to split off parts of themselves. An intact undead can only separate a single part of itself as a piecemeal undead at any given time, but can spend a move action when within reach of the piecemeal undead created from its body to rejoin with it. When an undead separates a part of itself to create a piecemeal undead, it loses a number of hit points equal to the piecemeal undead's hit points, to a maximum of half the intact undead's current hit points. If the body part used grants the intact undead a natural attack (such as a skeleton removing its arm), that undead loses that natural attack until it rejoins with the piecemeal undead. If the body part is one of the intact undead's legs or wings, it reduces its movement speed with the appropriate movement type by 10 feet until it rejoins with the piecemeal undead.

The target receives a +4 bonus to their saving throw if you would move them into a location that is directly harmful to them (such as onto a bed of spikes, out of a window, etc.).

For the duration of this effect, the target suffers the effects of this ghost strike at the start of its turn, taking damage and being forced to move.

The target takes a penalty on all Diplomacy and Handle Animal checks equal to 1/2 your caster level. All creatures begin with an attitude of unfriendly towards you (unless their attitude would start worse). Any animals the target interacts with react wildly, with prey animals running away and predator animals baring fangs or even attacking the target.

On a failure, the target falls prone. \\n Extreme Hunger:  The target must eat and drink three times as much as normal every day or begin suffering from thirst and starvation. \\n Fumble:  Anytime the victim picks up or retrieves an object (including drawing a weapon or ammunition), there is a 50% chance that he immediately drops it. If ammunition is dropped, the attack being made is lost. Any remaining attacks in a full attack action may still be attempted. \\n Greater Pain:  Whenever the victim takes damage, he is staggered for 1 round. \\n Magically Conductive:  When the victim is adjacent to the area of a damaging spell or spell-like effect, the area expands to include the victim. \\n Old Age:  The target gains the penalties (but not the benefits) of advancing to the next age category. This does not actually increase their age. \\n Phobia:  The target is cursed with a fear of a concept, chosen by the caster (such as crowds, spiders, rats, thunder, loud noises, etc.).

A target cannot be frightened by the same phobia's manifestation more than once per hour (such as the same spider, the same crowd, etc.) but new instances of the phobia work normally. GMs should determine if a phobia is appropriate by considering how frequently the target may encounter it. A phobia which would constantly trigger, such as a phobia towards \\\"skin\\\" or \\\"all clothing\\\", would be more debilitating than the chance to take no action from the Curse (ghost strike)'s base options, and would not be appropriate. This curse is a mind-affecting effect. [Gravecaller's HB] \\n Repel Healing:  The victim cannot heal naturally, and magical healing heals the victim by only half the usual amount (minimum 1 point).

The target must be within range of your ghost strike in order for you to use this ability on them (or within close range if you do not possess the ability to use ghost strike). If the creature is dying but alive and fails its saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, it can still resist this effect by attempting a Will save as if it were still alive. The value of the soul gem created depends on the nature of the creature it is made from (see below). Soul gems created by this effect crumble to dust after 1 day per caster level, releasing the trapped soul to travel on to the afterlife. Only one soul gem can be created from a dying creature. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a magical skill check against your MSD. Failure results in the resurrection having no effect, while success shatters the target's soul gem and returns the creature to life as normal. If you possess the Death sphere Soul Trap advanced talent, you may transfer a soul contained in a soul gem into an appropriate gemstone as a standard action by spending 3 spell points. If a creature does not possess a soul, they are unaffected by this talent. If a creature's soul is already pledged to another entity such as a god or outsider, said entity may seek to reclaim the soul somehow. The Value of Souls Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). It is worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice may be considered evil or an affront to the natural order in certain settings unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within). Life Force:  A souls' life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested x 1000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature is 1000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp. Age:  A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no Intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp. Flavor:  As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of a chaotic good deity might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly to chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way. A soul's value can be used as currency when purchasing favors from outsiders or may be used as the materials to craft items. Other uses such as spell, ritual, or incantation components may exist at GM discretion. Oath of Loyalty and Souls When a being who has sworn an Oath of Loyalty dies, the being or organization which they have sworn the Oath of Loyalty to (referred to as the claimant) may claim the character's soul. A claimed soul cannot be resurrected by any means short of a wish or miracle spell (unless the claimant wishes otherwise) and the claimant is automatically aware of any successful resurrection of a soul they have claimed. A claimed soul resurrected in this way is considered to have forsworn any Oaths of Loyalty they have previously sworn.\"\n",

You must create the undead creature or animated object as usual, but by placing the spirit into the target, the spirit is brought back to life within this new body. The object or undead creature gains the mental attributes, personality, memories, etc. of the selected spirit, but otherwise is normal for its new creature type. (At the GM's discretion, a spirit bound to a permanent animated object or undead creature may recover or gain class levels over time, but loses at least 1 level per CR of its new form.) An undead creature or animated object created in this way is not automatically under your control. \\n If you possess the Resurrection advanced Life talent, you may place the spirit into a new body, bringing the soul back to life, even if you do not have the target's body, it is missing vital components, or the target has been dead for longer than the time limit. You must possess either a soulless body (such as one created through the Fleshcraft and Create Materials advanced Creation talents), or else a body assembled from other, recently slain bodies. (Assembly requires either the target's body with one additional body for every replaced vital component, or else a minimum of six different bodies\\u2014one for each limb, the torso including head, and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required.) You may bring the target back to life with the Resurrection advanced Life talent. The target retains its ability scores and class levels (even those dependent on blood, such as sorcerer levels) but its race and appearance depend on the body possessed. Death Sphere Feats\"\n",

You must possess the Death sphere to choose living or the Life sphere to choose undead.

This prevents a character from benefiting from both the Hallow (word) against evil and the Hallow (word) against undead, as modified by this feat, against the same target or effect. Likewise, a regular Serendipity consecration and the Living Bastion-modified Serendipity consecration's effects would not stack, despite granting different bonus types. Note:  For the purposes of this feat, a living creature is any creature with a Constitution score. Example:  A Fate sphere caster uses the Divine Force (consecration) talent. Instead of using the Fate sphere caster's alignment, the caster chooses living and affects any undead, regardless of their alignment, and does not affect living creatures. That same caster uses the Enmity (word) talent, choosing undead and targeting a living creature.

In addition, undead you control can benefit from morale bonuses granted by your totems and rallies. Necrosis Feats Necrosis feats represent ongoing necromantic modification, corruption, or experimentation the character has made on her body to bring it closer to undead anatomy. Necrosis feats are distinct from more common feats in two ways. Tainted:  Upon taking a necrosis feat, the character's body becomes contaminated with negative energy. From that point on, if the character dies, returning him to life proves to be more difficult. Any spellcaster who attempts to bring the character back from the dead must attempt a magical skill check (DC = 10 + the slain character's Hit Dice) or have the effect fail. Effects that may only bring a creature back that has died within 1 round (such as the Resuscitate talent) gain a +5 to this check. Each necrosis feat beyond the first increases this DC by 1. Greater Power:  Necrosis feats increase in power relative to the number of necrosis feats a character possesses. Most necrosis feats grant far greater effects to characters with at least four necrosis feats. For necrosis feats that require an immediate action to activate them, you may activate as many necrosis feats as you desire as part of the same immediate action (although you must spend the required spell points for each activated feat). Note:  Characters use their Death sphere caster level when determining the effects of any necrosis feats they possess (such as when determining range) unless otherwise stated.\"\n",

This is resolved before the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 41 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d4 + CL/2 points of Strength damage that disappears after 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 43 \\n The caster is compelled to exhume the body of 1 creature of the humanoid type per 3 caster levels (minimum 1). This compulsion will not cause the caster to deliberately enter dangerous situations, but overrides all other concerns. This effect persists for one day per caster level or until the compulsion is fulfilled. \\n \\n \\n 44 \\n All creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area must succeed on a Fortitude save or become exhausted. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n Nearby dead invertebrates of Tiny size and smaller animate as undead and follow the caster for 10 minutes per caster level. Their noise imposes a penalty on Stealth checks equal to half caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d4 + CL/2 points of Dexterity damage that disappears after 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n All corpses within long range of the caster (other than those targeted by the triggering effect) become undead per reanimate for 1 round per caster level. These undead are hostile toward the caster. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n The caster takes a -4 penalty on all saves against disease for 10 minutes per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Will save or be paralyzed for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, all living creatures find the caster unsettling. A Handle Animal check with a DC equal to 10 + caster level/2 is required to make any animal approach within 20 ft. of the caster and all creatures interacting with the caster have their disposition drop by one step until the end of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n (Combat) All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be paralyzed for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster emits an aura out to close range that forces all living creatures that end their turn within it to succeed on a Fortitude save or contract a random disease. Roll 1d10 to determine which disease (1 blinding sickness, 2 bubonic plague, 3 cackle fever, 4 filth fever, 5 leprosy, 6 mindfire, 7 red ache, 8 shakes, 9 slimy doom, 10 roll twice and take both, ignoring further results of 10). The caster is excluded from this effect. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n Undead creatures created by the effect or within close range of the caster when it is cast, for 1 hour per caster level afterwards, will explode in a miasmic cloud when destroyed. When such an undead creature is destroyed, it creates a cloud out to close range, as the heavy mist option of category 2 rain per the Weather sphere for 1d6 rounds. Any creature that starts its turn inside this cloud must save against filth fever, using your Death sphere DC in place of the disease DC. \\n \\n \\n 54 \\n The caster takes a -4 penalty on all saves versus death effects for 10 minutes per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n Effect receives a +2 bonus to caster level. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster emits an aura out to close range that forces all living creatures that end their turn within it to succeed on a Fortitude save or contract a random disease. Roll 1d10 to determine which disease (1 blinding sickness, 2 bubonic plague, 3 cackle fever, 4 filth fever, 5 leprosy, 6 mindfire, 7 red ache, 8 shakes, 9 slimy doom, 10 roll twice and take both, ignoring further results of 10). The caster is included in this effect. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n The spirit of a dead ancestor appears behind the caster for 1 hour. This shade is a ghost, but with no magic or touch attacks; it has no ability to interact with the world at all except for speech and sight. There is a 50% chance the ghost will serve and aid the caster as best it can, but otherwise the ancestor is critical of the caster's life choices and will spend the entire time loudly critiquing the caster's decisions, preventing any form of stealth or sleep. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n The casting time increases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n (Combat) The caster is stunned for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d4 + CL/2 points of Strength damage that disappears after 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n A harmless ghost follows the caster for 10 minutes per caster level, loudly lamenting its fate but taking no other actions. This ghost has hit points and saves per a Conjuration sphere companion of the effect's caster level and reforms 1 minute after it is destroyed, continuing its lament. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n The caster emits an aura out to close range for 1d4 rounds, dealing 1d6 points of negative energy damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures in that area, including the caster. A Fortitude save halves this damage, though the caster does not receive a save. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, the caster leaves behind a shadowy trail of negative energy. Any creature that enters a square that has been occupied by the caster since the beginning of the caster's previous turn takes negative energy damage equal to caster level. Creatures healed by negative energy are instead healed. A creature may only be affected by this ability once per turn. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 temporary negative level. This increases to 1d2 negative levels at caster level 5 and by one additional die size every 5 caster levels thereafter. These negative levels last for 1 minute per caster level and cannot cause the creature's negative level total to equal or exceed the creature's Hit Dice. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n All undead creatures within medium range of the target must succeed on a Will save or attack the caster to the best of their ability for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels. This effect applies to any undead created by the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n For 1 day per caster level, one of the caster's limbs (usually an arm) becomes skeletal. This has no mechanical effect, but may cause negative reactions if not concealed. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n (Combat) The caster is dazed for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n The caster becomes imperceptible to undead creatures for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n Undead creatures created by the effect or within close range of the caster when it is cast lose their immunity to mind-affecting effects for 1 hour per caster level. For the purpose of such effects, treat them as if they were the creatures they were in life. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n The caster emits an aura of pestilence out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, including the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves against disease. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n All creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area must succeed on a Fortitude save or become fatigued. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster becomes unable to control undead creatures by any means. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n For 1 day per caster level, one of the caster's heads becomes skeletal. This has no mechanical effect, but may cause negative reactions if not concealed. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n The caster emits an aura of death out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, excluding the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves versus death effects. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n The caster becomes unable to perceive undead creatures for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n For 1 round per caster level, the caster emits an aura out to close range that forces all living creatures that end their turn within it to succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 temporary negative level. All negative levels from this effect stack. The caster is excluded from this effect. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n As an instantaneous effect, all dead creatures within long range of the caster are animated as skeletons per the reanimate ability of the Death sphere. The caster has no control over these creatures and they do not count against the number of undead he can active at one time with his reanimate ability. These skeletons are hostile to all living creatures. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n As an instantaneous effect, all dead creatures within long range of the caster are animated as zombies per the reanimate ability of the Death sphere. The caster has no control over these creatures and they do not count against the number of undead he can active at one time with his reanimate ability. These zombies unerringly seek out the caster to attack him until destroyed. \\n \\n \\n 83 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, all creatures within long range of the caster when this result is triggered exude the scent of decaying flesh, attracting the attention of carrion feeders and causing most creatures interacting with them to have their disposition drop by one step until the end of this effect. \\n \\n \\n 84 \\n The caster is fatigued. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n The caster emits an aura of death out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, including the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves versus death effects. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 87 \\n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n The caster and the nearest creature that is a valid target switch bodies for 1 round per caster level. This functions as the Possession advanced talent. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are lost. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n (Combat) All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 93 \\n The caster emits an aura of pestilence out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, excluding the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves against disease. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster emits an aura out to close range that forces all living creatures that end their turn within it to succeed on a Fortitude save or become fatigued. Fatigued creatures are unaffected. The caster is excluded from this effect. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n Wailing spirits fill an area out to long range of the caster with their cries for 2d4 rounds. All concentration checks within this area suffer a penalty equal to half caster level (minimum 1) and all spells with verbal components suffer a 10% chance of failure. Deaf creatures are immune to this effect. \\n \\n \\n 96 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 97 \\n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 98 \\n The caster is exhausted. \\n \\n \\n 99 \\n (Combat) All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or be sickened 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 100 \\n All corpses within long range of the caster (other than those targeted by the triggering effect) become undead per reanimate for 1 round per caster level. These undead are helpful toward the caster. Gamemastering Necromancy and Morality When you are a living creature, death can be scary. Death is the end of the world we know. For many people, this association between fear and death often leads to avoidance and disgust of all things connected with death - corpses, graveyards, mortuaries, and the like - and a mistrust of those that willing associate themselves with such things. As widespread as these attitudes are, there are people, cultures, and worlds with other ways of conceptualizing their relationship with death. What follows are three possible ways to handle this situation, though they are not mutually exclusive: A GM could create multiple sources of power over undeath and allow players to choose between them.\"\n",

      "            \"benefits\": \"For an alternate world-building seed, consider a world in which a judge-like god of the dead and community rules necromantic magic: The reanimate ability gains the [lawful] descriptor. To create an undead is to honor the life and work of a person and deem them worthy of reanimation. To continue to use the reanimate ability, a caster must maintain the favor of the deity. This includes participating in a ritual feast at least once each year in which the forebears of a community are awakened to walk the streets to inspire the living and renew collective identity. Skeletons and zombies are always lawful neutral. Access to items and abilities that allow living creatures to be healed by negative energy are widespread. Necromancy and Society When including necromantic players, NPCs, and activity in your games, remember that people don't have to base their opinions on necromancy purely on alignment. A good or neutral metropolis might allow necromancers to practice in their university - even in a world where raising the dead is utterly evil - to allow other casters to keep an eye on their activity and not excessively provoke them. Even in a world where the Death sphere is neutral, a farming community might be fine with an adventuring party reanimating the bandits that were harassing them, but might object to raiding the mausoleum and leaving with the remains of their ancestors. Wrestling with the complicated ethical questions or reveling in the moral gray areas situations like these provide is often one of the attractions of playing a necromancer. Creating robust and varied attitudes towards undead will give your players more chances to engage in the roleplaying side of walking around with a bag of bones. Here are some sample ideas: Venerated:  Undead and those who can create them hold the highest positions in society. Powerful forces within the setting may attempt to ally with necromantic PCs to gain credibility or attempt to quietly dispose of them to nip a new rival in the bud. Regulated:  Undead are welcome, but must be registered with the proper authorities, have a license from the authorities, and pay nominal dues. Some undead (particularly those that can replicate themselves violently) may be outlawed entirely. Sophisticated systems to detect and control undead exist. Chain gangs of zombies pull huge wagons for public transportation or turn mills to grind grain. Curiosities:  Undead are extremely uncommon on nonexistent in this area. Reactions vary: Friendly questions, amused denial, or deep suspicion are all likely. Death magic might just be poorly understood - or it might be suppressed by nearby arcane energies. Contraband:  Undead are a hot, illegal commodity. Labor might be scarce, or work might need to be done that is impossible for the living (mining at the bottom of a lake, hauling toxic cargo, etc.). Having a necromancer is as vital for a criminal group as having a lockpick or a fence. Their legal status might be due to the origin of the corpses, the use of the undead, past tragedy, or religious tension. Craftsmanship:  Creating undead is seen as a form of expression, similar to music or sculpture. Pristine, sparkling skeletons in royal regalia stand at key points, ready for a use of Necrotic Senses to quickly observe distant locations. Ballets involving dozens of elaborately-costumed zombies are popular entertainment. Hunted:  Out of hatred, duty, or sport, a cabal of undead-hunters scours the area. They may or may not care about apprehending the necromancer behind the reanimation, so long as they're able to take down their quarry.\"\n",

You may spend a spell point to increases this effect to making the target exhausted for 1 minute per caster level (Fortitude negates). On a successful save, the target is still fatigued for 1 round. Unlike regular fatigue and exhaustion, these conditions end as soon as the duration expires. Reanimate [Core] As a standard action, you may touch an intact dead body and spend a spell point to reanimate it as a zombie or skeleton (depending on the composition of the body in question) for 1 minute per caster level. This creature gains the zombie or skeleton template and obeys your commands, although only simple commands such as \\\"go\\\", \\\"stay\\\", \\\"attack\\\", or \\\"guard\\\" are understandable. A reanimated body cannot speak and has no knowledge or ability to think and so cannot answer questions or reveal anything it knew in life. When the duration expires, the body collapses until reanimated again. It does not regain hit points between reanimations. If reduced to 0 hp, the body collapses and is destroyed; it cannot be reanimated again. You may have a total number of reanimated creatures active at any one time whose combined Hit Dice does not exceed twice your caster level. If you attempt to reanimate a creature that would push your total beyond this limit, your reanimated creatures cease to be reanimated sequentially from oldest to newest until the Hit Dice total is low enough to permit the new reanimated creature. You cannot reanimate a creature with more Hit Dice than twice your caster level, and creatures with more than 20 racial Hit Dice can never become skeletons or zombies. Death Talents\"\n",

You deliver 2 surges, each requiring a melee touch attack or a ranged touch attack within range. A ranged surge counts as a ray attack. Each surge may be delivered at the same or different targets, but all surges must be delivered simultaneously. Determine the damage dealt by each surge by distributing the damage dice dealt by your destructive blast between each surge. A surge must deal at least 1 damage die or you do not create that surge. If you spend an additional spell point, you may deliver one additional surge, plus 1 surge for every 6 caster levels you possess. Even if this (blast shape) damages a target more than once, this (blast shape) only counts as damaging a target once for the purposes of (blast type) effects and the Cascade Failure talent. Additional effects from a destructive blast modified with this blast shape only affect a creature once regardless of how many times they are damaged. Example:  A destructive blast which deals 7d6 damage could be distributed between the two surges as 3d6 and 4d6, 1d6 and 6d6, or any combination the caster chooses. Each surge must deal at least 1d6 damage, or the caster does not create it and the burst is lost. A caster would only make a single disarm attempt against a creature struck multiple times by this blast shape when modified by the Static Blast blast type, and only applies additional effects from the Admixture talent or admixture feats to the damaged creature a single time. Effects not caused by the destructive blast, such as additional damage caused by the Fate sphere Harm (word), would trigger on each successful surge. Additional damage from other sources (such as the bonus damage from the Primal Blast feat) would apply to each surge. Sneak attack is never applied multiple times, as per the normal Paizo FAQ on spells and sneak attack, regardless of whether you are delivering melee or ranged surges. Author's Note: - Blast Salvo and Spell Combat  The Blast Salvo talent cannot be used alongside a magus's spell strike to deliver multiple surges; surges must be used as part of the same initial action (either casting, the initial spellstrike, etc.) or are lost. This talent is otherwise meant to be an analog to scorching ray with a melee option, not chill touch, and is not synergistic with spell combat or similar abilities.\"\n",

Assign each of these blast types a single number which could be rolled on a d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20 with the die used corresponding to the number of talents you have selected (a d6 if you selected 6, etc.). When you use Erratic Blast, after deciding on your target(s) but before rolling attack rolls or saves, roll a die corresponding to the number of talents selected. Use the talent corresponding to the die roll result to determine the damage die, damage type and additional effects (including feats or class abilities such as Fan The Flames, Frozen To The Bone or elementalist's favored element) to determine the effects of the destructive blast on the target(s). Erratic Blast costs a number of spell points equal to the greatest spell point cost of the blast types selected. If you possess the Admixture talent, you may choose to make the maximum possible value of the die (8 for a d8, for an example) be an admixture of two other blast types which you have selected for the talent. Roll twice more on the table, ignoring any repeat rolls or any further maximum rolls. The next two results rolled are used together as an admixture at no increased spell point cost. If you have the Greater Admixture talent, you instead roll three times and use the next three results rolled for the admixture. You cannot use the Admixture talent with an Erratic Blast. If you possess any Admixture feats, you may select any effects that you could apply to an admixture (such as ghost strikes if you possess Ghostly Admixture).

The new sphere effect is still subject to spell resistance if the destructive blast would not be, and the target makes a new, separate saving throw against the new effect.\"\n",

Archetypes Specializing in Destruction Admixture Savant The Admixture Savant is an  Elementalist  that specializes in the use of the Admixture talent, gaining new abilities to maximize their use of this power. Blaster The Blaster is an  Armorist  that gains the use of a powerful arm cannon that can make destructive blasts. Doomblade The Doomblade is a  Mageknight  that transforms their destructive blasts into a weapon they can wield. Elemental Scion The Elemental Scion is a  Shifter  with added skill at elemental transformations and destructive blasts that match their element. Entropic Sage The Entropic Sage is a  Hedgewitch  that focuses on using the Energy Strike talent to overcome their foes. Kinetic Scourge The Kinetic Scourge is a  Mageknight  that can use the Energy Tether talent in a variety of creative - and destructive - ways. Scion Scions are kineticists who channel powerful destructive energies. Soulfire Master The Soulfire Master is a  Thaumaturge  that can burn through their vitality to improve and empower their spells. Wandslinger The Wandslinger is a Gunslinger that can create and use wands keyed to the Destruction sphere. Adaptation While there are many blast type talents, it is neither possible nor desirable to publish every imaginable combination of damage type, die size, and additional effect. If a combination that has not been published is desired, players and gamemasters are encouraged to invent new abilities appropriate to the needs of the character. A blast type talent has four components: 1. Damage Type:  What form does the damage take? This is key for determining what resistances impact the total damage. DR/slashing is useless against fire, while a fire elemental will take full damage against a shrapnel blast. So far, acid, cold, electric, fire, force, negative energy, nonlethal, physical (blunt/piercing/ slashing), sonic and untyped damages have been used. Types uncommonly resisted are more valuable than commonly resisted types like fire or cold. Sonic and force damage are almost never resisted, making them prime choices from an optimization perspective, a benefit that must be considered when balancing the final talent. \\n 2. Additional Effect:  Not all status effects are created equal. Dazzled is fairly trivial and thus could be applied for multiple rounds without a save, while paralyzed can lead to immediate death by coup de grace. Stone Blast bypasses spell resistance, which, combined with its ability to bypass weapon type-based DR, accounts for its lack of additional effects. The duration of these effects and the presence or absence of a saving throw is critical in balancing your new talent. Permanent effects are solely the province of advanced talents. \\n 3. Die Size:  What dice do you roll to determine the blast's damage? Largely used as a balancing factor, such as Crystal Blast, which inflicts a fairly long duration of a reasonably powerful condition, entangled, as well as creating difficult terrain, useful for controlling the battlefield, has its damage reduced to d4, yet remains one of the most useful blast types. For contrast, Searing Blast deals a commonly resisted damage type, fire, and has no additional effects, thus has its damage die increased to d8. The average damage is the same as with Acid Blast , but the lack of the delay on part of the damage is desirable, somewhat offsetting the less desirable damage type. \\n 4. Spell Point Cost:  Do you need to pay additional spell points to use it? As force damage is rarely resisted and useful for its ability to damage incorporeal creatures, Force Blast, which also carries the additional effect of knocking foes prone on a failed save, costs an additional spell point to use. A blast that deals bludgeoning damage with the same die size and additional effect would not have to carry this additional SP cost. For example, a player has a ice themed thaumaturge, taking the destruction sphere, as well as the creation sphere and the nature sphere with water geomancing. Now, after a few levels, the player has decided that the thaumaturge's battlefield control needs some improvement, since long adventuring days have made the heavy use of creation undesirable, but doesn't want to break the ice theme. Changing crystal blast to fit with an ice-themed character is simple enough. A single type of physical damage, piercing, is hindered by most types of damage reduction (DR), while cold damage is one of, if not the, most resisted energy damage types, so simply changing the damage type should allow a reasonable power without further adjustment. Alternatives would be reducing the duration to one round and removing the difficult terrain effect, reasonably allowing a return to the default d6 die size. Removing the Reflex save on the entangle effect, however, would require returning the die size to d4 and an additional spell point cost. For increased damage, a similar damage substitution with searing blast could be made, since fire and cold damage suffer from similar frequencies of resistance, or with acid blast, which is less commonly resisted than cold, for lingering damage. The new talents could be described in a reasonably thematic way, such as more intense cold or lingering frostbite respectively. Creating New Blasts Rather than filling a site with repetitive variations of the different possible combinations, a system for creating blast talents is presented below. This system is expressly optional and only to be used with the approval and participation of the GM. Careful attention should be paid to creating new blast types for characters with the focused energy drawback, as the penalty of the drawback is reduced with each additional blast type available. Choose the desired damage type and additional effects, then adjust duration, die size and cost.  Final result should be between 9-11 points.  Spell point cost should not exceed 1 SP unless designing an advanced talent. Effects beyond those listed may require an advanced talent. Responsibility for the final result making sense (entangling flame blasts, cold setting targets on fire) rests solely with the user. Any novel talent must of course be approved by the gamemaster. New blast types can take the place of existing base blast types of similar type (acid, frost, etc.), be added as additional options to the existing groups, or be made into entirely new blast type groups. When making a new blast type groups, it is best to have a minimum of three blast types to populate it, even if this means simply adapting existing blasts to fit the theme by changing their name and tweaking descriptive text. Some effects, especially those that deny standard actions such as nauseated, dazed, or stunned, should always incur a spell point cost.

If a combination that has not been published is desired, players and gamemasters are encouraged to invent new abilities appropriate to the needs of the character. A blast type talent has four components: 1. Damage Type:  What form does the damage take? This is key for determining what resistances impact the total damage. DR/slashing is useless against fire, while a fire elemental will take full damage against a shrapnel blast. So far, acid, cold, electric, fire, force, negative energy, nonlethal, physical (blunt/piercing/ slashing), sonic and untyped damages have been used. Types uncommonly resisted are more valuable than commonly resisted types like fire or cold. Sonic and force damage are almost never resisted, making them prime choices from an optimization perspective, a benefit that must be considered when balancing the final talent. \\n 2. Additional Effect:  Not all status effects are created equal. Dazzled is fairly trivial and thus could be applied for multiple rounds without a save, while paralyzed can lead to immediate death by coup de grace. Stone Blast bypasses spell resistance, which, combined with its ability to bypass weapon type-based DR, accounts for its lack of additional effects. The duration of these effects and the presence or absence of a saving throw is critical in balancing your new talent. Permanent effects are solely the province of advanced talents. \\n 3. Die Size:  What dice do you roll to determine the blast's damage? Largely used as a balancing factor, such as Crystal Blast, which inflicts a fairly long duration of a reasonably powerful condition, entangled, as well as creating difficult terrain, useful for controlling the battlefield, has its damage reduced to d4, yet remains one of the most useful blast types. For contrast, Searing Blast deals a commonly resisted damage type, fire, and has no additional effects, thus has its damage die increased to d8. The average damage is the same as with Acid Blast , but the lack of the delay on part of the damage is desirable, somewhat offsetting the less desirable damage type. \\n 4. Spell Point Cost:  Do you need to pay additional spell points to use it? As force damage is rarely resisted and useful for its ability to damage incorporeal creatures, Force Blast, which also carries the additional effect of knocking foes prone on a failed save, costs an additional spell point to use. A blast that deals bludgeoning damage with the same die size and additional effect would not have to carry this additional SP cost. For example, a player has a ice themed thaumaturge, taking the destruction sphere, as well as the creation sphere and the nature sphere with water geomancing. Now, after a few levels, the player has decided that the thaumaturge's battlefield control needs some improvement, since long adventuring days have made the heavy use of creation undesirable, but doesn't want to break the ice theme. Changing crystal blast to fit with an ice-themed character is simple enough. A single type of physical damage, piercing, is hindered by most types of damage reduction (DR), while cold damage is one of, if not the, most resisted energy damage types, so simply changing the damage type should allow a reasonable power without further adjustment. Alternatives would be reducing the duration to one round and removing the difficult terrain effect, reasonably allowing a return to the default d6 die size. Removing the Reflex save on the entangle effect, however, would require returning the die size to d4 and an additional spell point cost. For increased damage, a similar damage substitution with searing blast could be made, since fire and cold damage suffer from similar frequencies of resistance, or with acid blast, which is less commonly resisted than cold, for lingering damage. The new talents could be described in a reasonably thematic way, such as more intense cold or lingering frostbite respectively. Creating New Blasts Rather than filling a site with repetitive variations of the different possible combinations, a system for creating blast talents is presented below. This system is expressly optional and only to be used with the approval and participation of the GM. Careful attention should be paid to creating new blast types for characters with the focused energy drawback, as the penalty of the drawback is reduced with each additional blast type available. Choose the desired damage type and additional effects, then adjust duration, die size and cost.  Final result should be between 9-11 points.  Spell point cost should not exceed 1 SP unless designing an advanced talent. Effects beyond those listed may require an advanced talent. Responsibility for the final result making sense (entangling flame blasts, cold setting targets on fire) rests solely with the user. Any novel talent must of course be approved by the gamemaster. New blast types can take the place of existing base blast types of similar type (acid, frost, etc.), be added as additional options to the existing groups, or be made into entirely new blast type groups.

This sensor can be detected as though it were a scrying sensor (Perception DC 20 + caster level) and dispelled. When you create a sensor, you may choose to either divine for creatures, detecting any creature which enters the sensor's range, or divine with a (divine) effect which locates information in an area (such as the base Divination sphere effect, the Divine Undead alternate divination, or the Detect Spellcaster talent, but not the Ultravision alternate divination or the Augury talent). The sensor constantly divines the area for the chosen information as though you were divining, and the sensor's ability to divine is modified by any effects that alter your divine ability (such as the Limited Penetration or Shaped Divination drawbacks would affect the alarm's ability to penetrate materials or require you to choose a direction in a cone or line when creating the alarm). The sensor does not pinpoint or reveal the location of something it divines, but otherwise reveals the presence, number, and power of each detected piece of chosen information (such as revealing the presence, number, and power of all fey with Detect Faetouched, but not their location). Optionally, when creating a sensor, you may choose to set any combination of an audible alarm, a mental alarm, or a password. An audible alarm produces a gentle sound, centered on the sensor's location, whenever the sensor detects something, such as a chime or bell. This sound can be heard within the sensor's range, but can be muffled by walls and doors, reducing the range of the sound by 10 feet for each interposing door or wall. Silence effects can muffle this sound. \\n A mental alarm alerts you with a mental \\\"ping\\\" whenever the sensor detects something and you are within 1 mile of the sensor. This ping can awaken you from sleep, but otherwise does not disturb concentration. Silence effects cannot muffle this ping. \\n A password is a phrase chosen when creating a sensor with this talent.

Like alternate divinations, this advanced talent grants additional divinations depending upon what other spheres you know. Unlike alternate divinations, however, this advanced talent grants new sense abilities instead of divine abilities. Creation: Material Sense:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain material sense, automatically detecting the presence of a single material you could create or alter within close range as if you could see it (the material is chosen when you cast this sense). A character can use material sense to distinguish color or visual contrast so long as the distinct components are perceptible if one can only see the specific materials sensed (for example, a character who selects ink with material sense could read documents written in ink but could not see goldfoil illuminations). However, the character is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character can detect creatures who have the material as part of their body but does need line of effect to detect objects made of the material. Material Sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent. Dark: See in Darkness:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain the see in darkness ability. The creature can see perfectly in all darkness, including magical darkness that otherwise might obstruct darkvision. Death: Spirit Sense:  You may spend a spell point to gain the spirit sense ability, which allows you to know when immortal or deathless beings are nearby. You automatically sense the presence of undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures within close range, as if you could see them. A character cannot use spirit sense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive noncreature nonliving material using spirit sense but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Spirit sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent. Life: Lifesense:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain lifesense, automatically detecting the life force of beings within close range as if you could see them. A character cannot use lifesense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material or nonliving creatures (such as constructs or undead) using lifesense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Lifesense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent. Mind: Thoughtsense:  You may spend a spell point to gain the thoughtsense ability. You automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within close range who you could target with your Mind sphere abilities as if you could see them. If you spend an additional spell point, you may detect and locate all types of conscious creatures, not just those that you could affect with mind-affecting effects. Nondetection, Unplottable, and similar effects block thoughtsense. Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and nonsentient (Intelligence 1\\u20132) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects. Creatures lacking an Intelligence score, or with a score less than 1, cannot be detected or located with thoughtsense unless you have selected that creature's type with the Recondite Stimuli talent. A character cannot use thoughtsense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material using thoughtsense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Thoughtsense can be foiled by illusions with the Implausible Deniability feat. Telekinesis: Touchsight:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain the touchsight ability. You gain the ability to \\\"feel\\\" your surroundings even when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your touchsight field emanates from you out to close range. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though you must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You automatically detect and pinpoint all creatures within close range as if you could see them. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with touchsight is enough to tell you the difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures. A character cannot use touchsight to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. Touchsight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusionary Touch talent. Weather: Storm Vision:  You may spend a spell point to gain a special sense granting the ability to negate any concealment, miss chance, and penalties to Perception directly caused by weather such as rain or fog (be they magical or natural).\"\n",

The abilities granted by this talent are improved if you possess certain alternate divinations. These additional options are noted as expanded options. If you possess the Divination sphere Greater Divine talent, the range of the sphere effects granted by this advanced talent increase by 1 step (1 mile to 10 miles per caster level, 10 miles to 100 miles per caster level). Divine Chart You may spend 2 spell points to divine a location within 1 mile per caster level, granting you vision of the specified location in up to a 1,000-foot radius as though viewed with a map. You gain accurate knowledge of the terrain and topography, including buildings and other structures, although fine topographical features or concealed or hidden locations are not revealed. In addition, all normally visible creatures are located, but no identifying characteristics of those creatures are known, appearing as an indistinct speck. This effect does not reveal invisible or incorporeal creatures or give any information about the interiors of locations (such as buildings or caves). Only information as viewed from above is made known to the caster. Expanded Options: If you possess the Divine Allegiance alternate divination, obvious war camps and contingents of troops are also made known to the caster with a symbol of their banner (if they openly carry such a symbol). \\n If you possess the Divine Illusions or Divine Force alternate divinations, the locations of invisible or incorporeal creatures are located respectively, as though detecting a normal creature. \\n If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, the locations of extraplanar gates, teleportation circles, and other permanent magical teleportation effects are made known to the caster (although where they connect to is not revealed). This sphere effect is instantaneous and does not adjust for changes that occur after this effect is cast. When casting this sphere effect, a blank piece of parchment or other reasonably flat surface may be used as an optional focus component, the divined information is scribed as a readable map. Alternatively, a sufficiently large table with a malleable substance (such as clay or sand) or bowl of water or other liquid may be used to instead create a still model of the divined area, which crumbles if the table or bowl is disturbed. Lay of the Land You may spend 2 spell points to divine the surrounding lands within up to 10 miles per caster level, extending underground and through objects without hindrance (unless you possess the Divination sphere Limited Penetration sphere-specific drawback). You instantly learn 2 facts + 1 fact per 4 caster levels about any of the following information pertaining to the surrounding lands: terrain, plantlife, minerals, bodies of water, people and civilizations, animal populations, the presence of powerful and unnatural creatures, supernatural phenomenon and landmarks (such as ley lines, fairy rings, extraplanar portals, etc.), or even the general state of the natural area. Expanded Options: If you possess the Divine Elements alternate divination, you may learn 1 additional fact about any element you could divine information for (such as air or water quality, active fires, etc.). \\n If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, when you learn a fact about a nearby supernatural phenomenon, if that supernatural phenomenon is connected to another location by a permanent teleportation effect, you learn the type of plane or location it connects to (such as geographical traits, if the same plane, or planar traits if extraplanar). \\n If you possess the Divine Weather alternate divination, you may learn 1 additional fact about the weather in the area, including past weather patterns or an accurate forecast of the natural weather for the next day per caster level. This fact is only accurate to naturally occurring weather, not any magical occurrences which could change the weather. This sphere effect provides facts and information which can pertain to any relevant information about the surrounding lands, subject to GM discretion, but should generally be limited to the topography, natural features, and overall qualities about such information (such as total population numbers, locations of major natural bodies, categories of and presence of plant life or minerals, including rare resources, general locations of animals or unnatural creatures, etc.). This sphere effect does not provide precise information about the nature of communities, signs of civilization, or constructed locations, but may reveal their general locations (such as knowing there is something man-made and constructed located inside a mountain, but not being aware of the nature of the construction, such as being a dungeon, shrine, or tower). Pathfinder You may spend 2 spell points to divine the shortest, most direct physical route to a prominent and specific destination, such as a castle, city, lake, crypt, or dungeon. The destination can be outdoors or underground as long as it is prominent. If no specific destination is named (such as \\\"a nearby lake\\\" or \\\"the nearest city\\\", instead of \\\"Fort Lotheed\\\"), this sphere effect locates the nearest destination which meets the description (subject to GM discretion). This sphere effect has no maximum range, but is limited to a destination on the same plane as the caster. This sphere effect is blocked by effects which protect against scrying and other forms of divination (such as not locating a dungeon which is warded against divination effects). Expanded Options: If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, you may designate an extraplanar gate, teleportation circle, and other permanent magical teleportation effect leading to a specific plane as your destination. If no such effect exists, this ability fails and grants no directions. For 1 day per caster level, the caster gains knowledge of the destination's general location and the destination's distance and direction from the caster. In addition, the caster gains a supernatural sense for any actions which must be taken to reach that destination (such as which corridor in a cavern to take). This sphere effect otherwise functions as the find the path spell for the purposes of interactions with the maze spell. Pathfinder Example:  The caster could not specify a specific cabin or home, but could specify the specific logging camp where the structure is located (such as \\\"The Maple Forest Logging Camp\\\"). Subject to GM discretion, sufficiently prominent individual buildings (such as landmarks or a noble's mansion) may qualify as a prominent destination if it is notable or unique to the location.\"\n",

If the ally does not have line of sight to the caster, the caster is treated as being blind. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n The caster gains insight into the future and may negate one attack against him within the next hour as an immediate action, but is blinded for 1 round after using this ability. \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n As an instantaneous effect, the caster gains knowledge of the location and quantity of all food (as determined by the caster's race) within divination range. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster believes that he gains an innate knowledge of the direction to the nearest source of potable water larger than 1 cubic foot. This belief is incorrect, giving a result opposite the actual location of such a source. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are not lost. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster may only communicate via obtuse poetry in dactylic hexameter. Even if they share a language, those listening must succeed a Linguistics check with a DC equal to the caster's save DC in order to understand him. \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all hostile creatures within long range of the caster gain the benefit of any special senses (blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, etc.) the caster possesses (whether naturally, from items, or from ongoing effects) but lose the benefit of any they would normally possess. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, all creatures within long range of the caster add 1/2 caster level (minimum 1) to their Hit Dice to determine the strength of their auras. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all creatures within long range of the caster gain the benefit of any special senses (blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, etc.) the caster possesses (whether naturally, from items, or from ongoing effects) but lose the benefit of any they would normally possess. \\n \\n \\n 54 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are lost. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n The caster receives a vision of being slain by the nearest hostile (or likely to become hostile) creature. If the caster encounters that creature during the next 1 hour per caster level, the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n The caster becomes aware of how many words have been spoken in the past 24 hours by all creatures within long range. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the caster is plagued by vague, indecipherable visions of the future, imposing a -1 penalty on concentration checks. This penalty increases by 1 every 5 caster levels. \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster receives flashes of the future, granting a +2 insight bonus to AC and attack rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n The caster receives a vision of a trusted ally stealing from him. For the next 24 hours, the caster takes all reasonable precautions to prevent allies from robbing him and does not treat that ally as an ally for the purpose of free movement and flanking. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n The caster gains instantaneous knowledge of the number of seconds until the next solar eclipse and feels compelled to immediately record this number, which requires writing implements and 1d6 full-round actions. This compulsion overrides all other concerns except personal safety and does not end until the compulsion is satisfied. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, to the caster's perception, all sources of water within long range shed light as a torch. Water contained in living bodies does not glow. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all allied creatures within long range of the caster gain the benefit of any special senses (blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, etc.) the caster possesses (whether naturally, from items, or from ongoing effects) but lose the benefit of any they would normally possess. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n The caster is exhausted. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the caster receives false flashes of the future, imposing a -2 penalty to AC and attack rolls. This penalty increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, creature's hostile to the caster within medium range become unable to perceive the caster. This effect ends for each individual creature after taking damage from a creature that could not be perceived due to this effect. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, the caster is flat-footed from the end of his turn until the start of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n The caster gains an augury regarding his next intended action. The result is accurate (weal or woe). \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster's allies within medium range become unable to perceive hostile creatures. This effect ends for each individual creature after taking damage from a creature that could not be perceived due to this effect. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster gains an innate knowledge of the direction to the nearest source of potable water larger than 1 cubic foot. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n The caster is convinced that hostile creatures appropriate to the area are within long range and takes appropriate action. This lasts for 10 minutes per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n For 10 minutes per caster level, physic pulses emanate from the caster. All non-mindless creatures within medium range may pinpoint the caster's square as a free action. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n As an instantaneous effect, the caster becomes aware of the location and quantity of all books, scrolls, and other written documents within divination range. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n The caster takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n (Combat) All creatures act in the reverse order of their initiative for 1d6 rounds. Affected creatures cannot take the delay action. \\n \\n \\n 83 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster reduces all distance penalties on Perception checks by caster level, but takes a penalty on saving throws against effects with the (light) and (sonic) descriptors equal to 1/2 caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 84 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster is unable to perceive creatures of his own creature type. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster gains tremorsense out to 30 feet. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n For 1 hour, the caster feels the pain of a blow before it lands, unconsciously flinching away. This grants a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves but imposes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. \\n \\n \\n 87 \\n The caster takes untyped nonlethal damage equal to caster level. This damage does not force concentration checks to cast or maintain sphere effects or spells. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster can speak and write only meaningless gibberish. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the caster loses the ability to speak and understand his native language(s) (those granted by race). \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, creature's hostile to the caster within medium range become unable to perceive the caster or his allies. This effect ends for each individual creature after taking damage from a creature that could not be perceived due to this effect. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n Effect receives a +2 bonus to caster level. \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n The caster is dazed for 1 round as he receives a vision of the most recent violent death of a humanoid within 1 mile per caster level. The caster learns the approximate direction and distance to the place this occurred. \\n \\n \\n 93 \\n The caster's mind is flooded with information. All Knowledge checks made in the next 10 minutes per caster level receive an insight bonus equal to caster level but require a full-round action to make. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n (Combat) The caster is dazed for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster becomes unable to perceive his allies. \\n \\n \\n 96 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 97 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, all creatures within close range of the caster may choose to share the caster's sensory information as a free action. Any creature using this ability is flat-footed until the start of their next turn. \\n \\n \\n 98 \\n The caster is dazed for 1 round and shaken for 1 round per caster level as he receives a vision of the nearest hostile (or likely to become hostile) creature. The caster learns the approximate direction and distance to this creature. \\n \\n \\n 99 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster is deafened. \\n \\n \\n 100 \\n The caster is assaulted by horrific visions of the past, nauseating him for 1 round. These visions grant a +4 bonus on Knowledge checks regarding the history of the caster's current location.\"\n",

Animated Objects For the most part, a player creating an animated object does not get to choose what construction points and flaws it possesses. Instead, it's construction points and flaws are determined by the GM to best reflect the type of object that was animated.

Special Abilities Construction Points Animated objects have a number of Construction Points (CP) used to purchase abilities and defenses in addition to those presented above. A Medium-sized animated object has 2 CP; differently sized animated objects have CP totals as detailed on the size chart on this page. If an animated object spends more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Construction points allow an animated object to approximate the object being animated; if a cloth shirt is being animated, it should possess the cloth flaw. If an iron bar is being animated, it should possess the 'metal' option listed below. Additional Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains an additional slam attack. Additional Natural Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains an additional natural attack. The animated object must have an appropriate appendage or part for the natural attack. Additional Movement (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed. Augmented Critical (Ex, 1 CP):  Increase the threat range for the animated object's melee attacks by 1 or the threat multiplier by 1. This cannot combine with itself or with the piercing attack or slashing attack animated object abilities. Armor (Ex; 2 CP):  The animated object is a suit of armor. When worn by another creature, it ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, any damage the wearer takes is dealt to the animated object instead; if the animated object loses all of its hit points, then the armor bonus it grants is reduced to +0. While worn, it grants its armor bonus to AC, as well as the benefits of any special abilities, as normal. As long as the animated object is still animated, it may be donned as a full-round action and removed as a swift action. Burn (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains burn (1d6) with its slam attacks. This can be applied multiple times. Its effects stack. Note:  Most objects that deal elemental damage do so by being on fire (such as a lit torch or candlestick). If an object might deal another type of damage, such as an animated bottle of acid, use the Burn quality and replace the damage type as appropriate. Constrict (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains constrict with its slam attacks (the animated object must have grab before it can take this ability). Durable (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object is exceptionally durable. It gains 5 additional hit points for each size category it has beyond Tiny, to a maximum of 30 additional hit points for Colossal animated objects. This can be applied multiple times, and its effects stack. Exceptional Reach (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains +5 feet of reach with one melee attack. Increase reach on all attacks for an additional +1 CP. Faster (Ex, 1 CP):  One of the animated object's movement modes increases by +10 feet. Fluid (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object is unusually fluid; it may squeeze through tight spaces as if it were two sizes smaller than it actually is. Garrote (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object strangles creatures it grapples - it gains the strangle special attack (the object must have grab before it can select this ability). Grab (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains grab special attack with slam attacks. Graft (Su; 1 CP):  The animated object can serve as a replacement limb for a creature two size categories larger than it. While attached to a creature, the animated object ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, the creature benefiting from the graft ignores any penalties due to missing that limb, and gains one of the animated object's natural attacks. If the animated object possesses any special attacks modifying that natural attack, the beneficiary of the graft gains it as well, using their size in place of that of the animated object. An animated object with graft may be attached to a creature with a DC 20 Heal check. Hollow (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object gains the swallow whole special attack with its slam attacks; creatures swallowed by the animated object do not automatically take damage (the animated object must have grab before it may select this ability). This can be applied multiple times, each time increasing the animated object's size category for the purposes of what creatures and objects it can grab and swallow by one. Improved Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  All the animated object's melee or ranged attacks do damage as though it were one size category larger. A crafter must purchase improved attack separately for melee and ranged attacks. Magic Item (Su; 1 CP):  The animated object is some description of magic item. It may activate itself as if it were holding or wearing itself. Magic weapons may apply their enchantments to one of their natural attacks (for example, an animated +1 dragon bane longsword would have a +1 dragon bane slam attack). Material Properties (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object's natural attacks are considered to be weapons made from the animated object's special material. The animated object must have metal or special material before it may select this ability. Metal (Ex, 2 CP):  The animated object is made of common metal. Its hardness increases to 10, and it gains a +2 increase to its natural armor bonus. Mithral animated objects cost 4 CP, and gain hardness 15 plus a +4 increase to natural armor. Adamantine animated objects cost 6 CP, gain hardness 20, and receive a +6 increase to natural armor. Special Materials (Ex; 1+ CP) The animated object's hardness is equal to the hardness of the Special Material it is made from. In addition, the animated object gains a natural armor bonus equal to the CP cost of this ability. This ability costs 2 CP for every +5 increase to hardness gained from this ability, rounded up. If the special material has a hardness less than 10, it costs 1 CP instead. If the material the animated object is created from has a hardness less than 5, use the Fragile flaw instead. Piercing Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  Replace one melee attack with an attack that does the same amount of piercing damage and has a \\u00d73 multiplier. Replace all melee attacks for an additional +1 CP. Animated object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on piercing attacks. Pull (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains a pull (5 feet) special attack with slam attacks (the animated object must have grab before it can take this ability). Ranged Attack (Ex, 2 CP):  Replace one slam attack with a ranged attack. It does the same amount of damage, and has a range of 20 feet. Replace all attacks for an additional +2 CP. Animated object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on ranged attacks. Resistance (Ex, 2 CP):  The animated object gains resistance 5 to one type of damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) chosen at the time of the animated object's creation. This effect can be applied multiple times. Its effects do not stack; each time it is applied, it applies to a different type of damage. Slashing Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  Replace one slam attack with an attack that does slashing damage and has either a 19\\u201320 threat range (for blade-like attacks) or a \\u00d73 threat multiplier (for axe or scythe-like attacks). Replace all melee attacks for an additional +1 CP. Animated object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on slashing attacks. Stone (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object is made of stone or crystal. Its hardness increases to 8 and it gains a +1 increase to its natural armor bonus. Toxic (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object is coated with a contact or injury poison. It gains the poison special attack with its slam attacks. The crafter may spend an additional CP to have that poison apply to all of its natural attacks instead. Trample (Ex, 2 CP):  The animated object gains the trample special attack. Trip (Ex, 2 CP)  The animated object gains the trip special ability with one of its slam attacks. Construction Flaws Animated objects can gain more CP by applying flaws, which hamper the animated object but provide additional CP to spend on beneficial abilities. If the CP gained in this way is not spent on beneficial abilities, its CR decreases by 1 for every 2 CP conserved. Aberration (Ex; +2 CP):  The animated object is made from squirmy flesh instead of inorganic substances; change its type to aberration, give it a Constitution score equal to its Strength score, replace construct traits (Ex) with amorphous (Ex) and darkvision 60 feet, and replace its hardness with an equal amount of damage reduction bypassed by magic. It is still mindless. Brittle (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object gains vulnerability to cold. Cloth (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object is made of thick cloth. Its hardness decreases to 0. Clunky (Ex, +1 CP):  Treat the animated object as though it had the staggered special quality. Flammable (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object gains vulnerability fire. Fragile (Ex; +1 CP):  The animated object gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Haunted (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object is haunted by a malevolent spirit. It takes damage from positive energy as if it were an undead creature and can be detected by detect undead. Immobile (Ex; +2 CP):  The animated object has a base land speed of 0 feet, and may not have abilities or flaws applied which alter its base land speed or grant it new movement speeds. Noncombatant (Ex; +1 CP):  The animated object does not possess a slam natural attack and cannot take hostile actions. If the animated object ever gains an Intelligence score, as a free action at the start of its turn, the animated object can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the caster's Enhancement sphere DC to defy this construction flaw for 1 round. [Gravecaller's HB] Slower (Ex, +1 CP):  One of the animated object's movement modes decreases by \\u2013 10 feet. Undead (Ex; +1 CP):  The animated object is made of corpse materials such as flesh or smooth bone; change its type to undead, adjust its Charisma score to be equal to its Strength score, replace construct traits (Ex) with undead immunities (Ex), and replaces its hardness with an equal amount of damage reduction bypassed by bludgeoning damage. It is still mindless. This flaw cannot be applied alongside the aberration flaw.  Special:  If the animated object also possesses the haunted construction flaw, the animated object is stunned for 1 round whenever it fails a saving throw against a positive energy effect. This bypassesses any immunities the animated object may possess. [Gravecaller's HB] Wild Magic\"\n",

For inanimate targets, treat this as the Bestow Intelligence talent. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n For 1 round per caster level, all weapons wielded by hostile creatures within close range of the caster gain the fragile quality, even if they are magical or masterwork. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the target gains a temporary enhancement bonus to Charisma equal to half the effect's caster level.

If you animate an enemy's armor or clothing, the enemy becomes entangled and must pass a Reflex save each round or also be staggered that round.

When worn by another creature, it ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, any damage the wearer takes is dealt to the object instead; if the object loses all of its hit points, then the armor bonus it grants is reduced to +0. While worn, it grants its armor bonus to AC, as well as the benefits of any special qualities, as normal. As long as the object is still animated, it may be donned as a full-round action and removed as a swift action. \\n Durable (Ex; 1 CP) \\n The object is exceptionally durable. It gains 5 additional hit points for each size category it has beyond Tiny, to a maximum of 30 additional hit points for Colossal animated objects. This can be applied multiple times, and its effects stack. \\n Fluid (Ex; 1 CP) \\n The animated object is unusually fluid; it may squeeze through tight spaces as if it were two sizes smaller than it actually is. \\n Garrote (Ex; 1 CP) \\n The object strangles creatures it grapples - it gains the Strangle special attack (the object must have Grab before it can select this ability). \\n Graft (Su; 1 CP) \\n The object can serve as a replacement limb for a creature two size categories larger than it. While attached to a creature, the object ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, the creature benefiting from the graft ignores any penalties due to missing that limb, and gains one of the object's natural attacks. If the object possesses any Special Attacks modifying that natural attack, the beneficiary of the graft gains it as well, using their size in place of that of the object. \\n An object with graft may be attached to a creature with a DC 20 Heal check. \\n Hollow (Ex; 1 CP) \\n The animated object gains the Swallow Whole special attack with its Slam attacks; creatures swallowed by the object do not automatically take damage (the object must have Grab before it may select this ability). This can be applied multiple times, each time increasing the object's size category for the purposes of what creatures and objects it can grab and swallow by one. \\n Magic Item (Su; 1 CP) \\n The object is some description of magic item. It may activate itself as if it were holding or wearing itself. Magic weapons may apply their enchantments to one of their natural attacks (for example, an animated +1 Dragon-Bane longsword would have a +1 Dragon-Bane slam attack). \\n Material Properties (Ex; 1 CP) \\n The object's natural attacks are considered to be weapons made from the object's special material. The object must have Metal or Special Material before it may select this ability. \\n Toxic (Ex; 1 CP) \\n The object is coated with a contact or injury poison. It gains the Poison special attack with its Slam attacks. The crafter may spend an additional CP to have that poison apply to all of its natural attacks instead. \\n New Flaws \\n Aberration (Ex; +2 CP) \\n The object is made from squirmy flesh instead of inorganic substances; change its type to Aberration, give it a Constitution score equal to its Strength score, replace Construct Traits (Ex) with Amorphous (Ex) and Darkvision 60 ft., and replace its Hardness with an equal amount of DR bypassed by magic. It is still Mindless. \\n Centralized (Ex; +2 CP) \\n The object has weak points, and loses its immunity to critical hits. \\n Immobile (Ex; +2 CP) \\n The object has a base land speed of 0 ft., and may not have abilities or flaws applied which alter its base land speed or grant it new movement speeds. \\n Fragile (Ex; +1 CP) \\n The object gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. \\n Animating Structural Features \\n As it stands, Animate Object abruptly stops scaling at approximately level 10 for anyone who wants to bring the animated object into a dungeon or other enclosed space with them. While there are ways around this problem (such as the Fluid ability, or using Alteration to shrink an animated object down to size), they ultimately cut into some of the fun of making a house smack people. \\n With this variant rule, Animate Object can be used on portions of structures, allowing casters to animate a hallway within a castle or the front door of a cottage. Objects animated in this way always have the Immobile flaw. Additionally, such objects are rigidly attached to the rest of the structure, reducing its Reach as if it were two size categories smaller than it actually is. \\n In exchange for this limitation, the animated portion of the structure may attack creatures that are within reach of any of its surfaces, and is immune to any effect that would move it that couldn't also move the structure it is a component of. \\n Elemental Objects \\n Currently, the sole form of energy damage you may add to the slam attacks of an animated object is fire. This makes sense for animated candlesticks, but what about animated flasks of acid or more exotic objects? As such, you may choose to replace the fire damage from the Burn ability with another type of energy damage when animating objects that are potentially dangerous due to some elemental hazard. \\n Objects of Exceptional Size \\n By default, the maximum size of objects that may be animated is Colossal. However, Drop Dead Studios has used three sizes past Colossal in previous products - namely Colossal+, Colossal++, and Colossal+++. \\n This variant expands the higher end of what's possible with animated objects as follows: \\n \\n \\n Caster Level \\n Size \\n Hit Dice \\n Maximum Construction Points \\n \\n \\n 30 \\n Colossal+ \\n 16d10+100 \\n 7 \\n \\n \\n 36 \\n Colossal++ \\n 19d10+120 \\n 8 \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n Colossal+++ \\n 22d10+150 \\n 9 \\n \\n \\n Other Materials \\n By default, the only options for an animated object's Metal ability are \\\"common\\\" metals, mithral, and adamantine. Similarly, the Stone ability offers a choice of generic stone or crystal. However, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game has introduced a vast number of special materials over the years; therefore, the following ability is introduced to cover any of those materials. \\n Special Materials (Ex; 1+ CP) \\n The animated object's hardness is equal to the hardness of the Special Material it is made from. In addition, the animated object gains a natural armor bonus equal to the CP cost of this ability. \\n This ability costs 2 CP for every +5 increase to hardness gained from this ability, rounded up. If the special material has a hardness less than 10, it costs 1 CP instead. \\n If the material the animated object is created from has a hardness less than 5, use the Fragile flaw instead.\"\n",

You may gain this fey-blessing multiple times, gaining this bonus in a different terrain each time. Magic talents marked as (fey-blessing) grant additional fey-blessings. Some (fey-blessing) talents have the polymorph descriptor. A creature may be under multiple of these fey-blessings at one time if they are from the same source. Rule Notes Alteration Sphere:  Some fey-blessings have the polymorph descriptor. A willing creature under the effects of one of these abilities may still be targeted by the shapeshift ability of the Alteration sphere. Each such fey-blessing maintained during the shapeshift reduces the number of traits that may be assigned as part of the shapeshift by 1. Unthreatening Form functions as a base form and may have traits added to it as if it were blank form. Fey creatures and Fey-Blessings:  Creatures with the fey type are unaffected by the base function of fey-link, but its duration is still needed for determining the length of time fey-blessings remain active. Due to their inherent connection, creatures of the fey type (naturally, not via fey-link) may begin a fey-link on themselves (and only themselves) as a free action. Fey-Blessing with Differing Caster Levels:  Fey-link and the fey-blessings applied to it do not necessarily have to have the same caster level. The duration and any other parameters based on the caster level of the fey-link are determined by the caster level with which it was cast. Likewise, any variable parameters of each individual fey-blessing are determined by the individual casting. Targets with Non-Ability Scores:  Some creature types lack certain ability scores, such as constructs and undead lacking a Constitution score. If such a creature is under the effects of fey-link, any non-ability score is treated as being 10, with the exception of Intelligence, which is treated as being 1. Do not recalculate the creature's hit points, saves, or skills, and do not grant any feats. Note that changing creature type can have a significant effect on type-based immunities; the creature under the fey-link may find itself susceptible to many effects it was previously immune to.

Lullaby:  You may play a peaceful lullaby to inflict a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against effects that cause sleep or the staggered condition on all hostile creatures. Performing one of these songs will occupy limbs and voice appropriate to the instrument (if any) such that they cannot be used to for other performances (such as bardic music) at the same time.\"\n",

The pouch is weightless and may not be used to hold anything other than the fairy dust it contains. If the pouch is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends. Destroying the pouch fills a 10-ft. radius with the chosen fairy dust, affecting all creatures in the area, including the caster. A successful saving throw against any effect that allows it grants the affected creature immunity to that effect from that caster for 24 hours. You gain knowledge of two types of fairy dust when you gain this talent; you may activate any one type of dust that you know when activating this fey -blessing. Choose from the following options: Amnesia:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or forget the past minute. This otherwise functions as the Amnesia talent of the Mind sphere. You must spend an additional spell point for this option. Bleed:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or bleed profusely when wounded. The next time the creature takes hit point damage, it begins taking bleed damage equal to your caster level. These bleed damage may be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or by receiving any amount of healing. If this dust is applied to a weapon, the weapon attack triggers the bleed damage. Blind:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Reflex save or treat all other creatures as having concealment for 1 round per caster level. Charm:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or have its disposition toward you increase by 1 step to a maximum of friendly for 1 minute. Fear:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or be shaken for 1 round per caster level. You may spend an additional spell point as part of activating the fey-blessing to instead have affected creatures be frightened for 1 round per caster level on a failed save and shaken for 1 round on a successful save. Glitter:  For 1 round per caster level, affected creatures take a penalty to Stealth equal to caster level and do not gain concealment from any effect that provides invisibility. Poison:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or suffer from itching poison, being compelled to scratch at the wound for 1 round (treat this as being dazed) and taking 1d2 Strength damage per round for 1 minute or until they succeed on a Fortitude save. You must spend an additional spell point for this option. Sleep:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1 round per caster level. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). You must spend an additional spell point for this option. As a standard action, you may fill a 5-ft. cube within close range with the dust, affecting any creature in that space. As a move action, you may apply fairy dust to a weapon, natural weapon, or piece of ammunition, or to a number of weapons or pieces of ammunition equal to your casting ability modifier (minimum 2) as a standard action. A creature that is struck by the weapon within 1 round per caster level of it being so treated suffers from the effects of the dust. You may chose to end this fey-blessing early, drawing and throwing the pouch to create a 20-ft. radius spread of fairy dust within close range, affecting all creatures within the area. The duration of multiple applications of dust stack. The pouch replenishes itself as a free action for the duration of the fey-blessing, then disappears when it ends. You may have multiple instances of this fey-blessing active at once; select a different option you know for each. Each instance creates a separate pouch. You may select this talent multiple times; each time you gain two more types of fairy dust. If the pouch is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you can summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. If you possess Fairy Flight, you also gain the following option: Flight:  For 1 minute per caster level, affected creatures gain the benefits of your Fairy Flight fey-blessing. This flight speed requires maintaining the proper frame of mind; if an affected creature is under the effects of an emotion or fear effect while flying, its fly speed from this ability is suppressed and it falls at a rate of 50 ft. per round until it lands (taking falling damage as normal) or the emotion or fear effect ends.\"\n",

Whenever you use this ability, you may choose to target a single creature rather than affect all creatures in the area. Cait Sidhe Taigham:  You demand tithe and tribute from others. As a standard action, you may compel one adjacent creature to deliver an object you designate (held in their hands or on their person) to you during their next turn. An affected target uses their standard action to deliver the requested object during their next turn. You may receive the object with an unoccupied hand, otherwise the object is set down in front of you. A successful Will save negates this effect; a creature may only be the target of this fey-blessing once every 24 hours. Grimalkin's Shade:  When you activate this fey-blessing, you summon a small grimalkin shade (or \\\"shade\\\") which takes the form of a cat's shadow in an unoccupied, adjacent square. This shade acts as an independent creature, listens to your commands, and will attempt to fulfill them to the best of its ability. The grimalkin cannot speak normally, but understands any language you speak and may communicate normally with you or anyone who can speak to a cat. While not in combat or not being ordered to complete a task, the shade behaves much like a cat, and may be affectionate or cold to those around it at its discretion. The shade acts on your initiative and must remain within medium range of you or have its tether to your magic become greatly weakened. If the shade would take damage while outside of this range and weakened, it is immediately dismissed and this fey-blessing ends. You may only have a single shade summoned at one time; if the shade would die, you may summon a new shade as a full-round action. When this fey-blessing ends, the shade is automatically dismissed. Grimalkin Shade The grimalkin shade is a creature which has simplified statistics using the caster's statistics or caster level, determined when the fey-blessing is cast.

The grimalkin makes a melee touch attack (5 + your caster level). If successful, the target takes 1d4 untyped energy damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d4) and must attempt a Will saving throw or be shaken for 1 round (using your Fallen Fey sphere DC). If the target is already shaken and fails their saving throw, the target is instead frightened for 1 round. This touch attack may be made while corporeal or incorporeal, and may be used as a standard action attack or attack of opportunity. \\n Vanish (Su):  The grimalkin may spend a swift action to become incorporeal. The grimalkin may remain incorporeal indefinitely and may become corporeal as a standard action. While incorporeal, the grimalkin may attempt a Stealth check to hide in any dim light or darkness, even while observed. Other Information and Statistics \\nThe grimalkin does not possess feats and does not possess skill ranks, but does possess skill bonuses as indicated in its core statistics. Despite being a size Small creature, other creatures may freely move through a square the grimalkin occupies without penalty, and the grimalkin may share its space with other creatures.

The target creature must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is alive, you must make a successful coup de grace attack to steal its skin. Should the creature survive this, it is nauseated as a pain effect, takes Constitution bleed of 1d4, bleed damage equal to three times your caster level, and takes a -10 penalty on saves against disease until its skin is regrown by regeneration or a similar effect. Should this bleed damage be halted by any means, it restarts in 1d4 rounds. You then may don or remove the stolen skin as a move action. When wearing a stolen skin, you take on the likeness of the skin's original owner, including the victim's voice, build, and size, but gain none of the creature's abilities. The stolen skin grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature, with none of the usual penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen skins are preserved for the duration of the fey-blessing and remain as supple as living skin. You may only have a single skin stolen at a time; stealing another forces you to discard any previously stolen skins. Discarded skins rot and decay normally. Discarded skins may not be reused.

      "            \"benefits\": \"Fairy rings can be found in any wilderness. They are never present in any developed area unless deliberately created. A ring is usually within 1d6 miles of any given wilderness location. If using a 6 mile hex map, each hex that lacks a settlement of city size or larger will have 1d2 natural fairy rings. Hexes with cities or larger settlements will have only 1 natural fairy ring. The fairy ring consists of a circle 5 to 10 ft. in diameter, consisting of coral (salt water oceans only), mushrooms, small stones, or wildflowers. Noticing the formation requires a DC 10 Perception check (modified for distance) and identifying it requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If exploring a hex, any fairy rings in that hex can be located with a DC 10 perception or Knowledge (nature) check as part of the normal exploration. Once located, rings may be opened using the Open Fairy Ring ritual or by those with the Faerie Ring Traveler advanced talent. Once opened, the gate formed to faerie remains open for 1d6 minutes, though fey creatures of sufficient power can hold it open longer or close it sooner. Rings tend to serve as focal points for local fey activity as well as attracting magical beasts native to the area. Accessing the ring may prove difficult without bargaining with the local fey and magic beast population. There is a 70% chance of a random encounter appropriate to the environment at each end of the fairy ring. Creatures larger than the size of the ring may have difficulty passing through; most rings are of Medium or Large size, occupying squares accordingly; a creature whose size is no larger than the size of the circle may pass through unimpeded. Creatures of one size larger may pass by squeezing. Creatures of two or more sizes larger cannot pass unless they possesses an ability allowing them to squeeze through small openings. Fairy rings can be broken if a section of them is destroyed. Each 5-ft. square that contains a ring or part of a ring can be targeted individually. The ring has an AC and touch AC of 10, with hardness 0 for flowers and mushrooms or 10 for coral and rocks, and each square has 30 hit points. Once broken, a ring cannot be opened until it is repaired. A fairy ring counts as a magic item with a caster level of 5 (higher level rings can exist) for the purposes of restoring its hit points, repairing it, or suppressing it's magic. The region of faerie the ring opens into is not apparent before crossing through, though the local fey are usually knowledgeable (if accurate information can be obtained from them) and may even be willing to open the way to favored persons. The connection point of a given ring may drift with time; using the same ring days apart is reliable, but over the course of a month it may change somewhat (roll 1d3; on a 1, move the random location result up one entry, on a 2 it is unchanged, on a 3 move down one entry) and over a year it may change significantly (re-roll).

The denizens of Faerie might populate entire cities, and look upon an intruder from the material plane with as much distrust as a mortal city might look upon a visiting ogre. As such, while the PCs might have incredible adventures in the realm of Faerie as determined by them and the GM, most mortal visitors to the world of Faerie do so only temporarily; using Faerie as a shortcut for their desired travels in the mortal world. Once in Faerie, the travelers must locate a fairy ring that connects to a spot near their desired destination. Friendly denizens of the plane may be willing to help and indifferent ones may be bribed or persuaded to give directions. Once the return ring's location is known, reaching it requires crossing 1d12 miles. There is a 25% chance each mile that the terrain will change (roll on Table 7.1). Random encounters are rolled for each hour of travel. When the destination is reached, just as with entering, there is a 70% chance of a random encounter appropriate to the environment at either end of the fairy ring.

In building or modifying a setting, it is important to ask what you want different elements to do. In some types of game, the fey are simply a creature type, more magical than humanoids, less strange than aberrations, and less aligned than outsiders. If that is all you need, the rest of this chapter may be of little interest. Fey creatures could also be representatives of the natural world. If so, there isn't necessarily a need for them to originate elsewhere; they are simply spirits tied to trees, streams, and rocks. Some work very well for this, such as dryads with their bond to trees and their nature magic. Others are less obvious. In addition to or instead of representing nature, they can represent other things, selecting creatures as appropriate. Not every creature is appropriate for every setting and selecting or modifying creatures to suit the desired framework is a valuable tool for setting-building. Having a separate plane offers some benefits. Adventures can be based on traveling through Faerie and having an entire plane makes room for all kinds of fey that may not fit well with narrower themes. Plots can also involve the relations between planes. Is Faerie at risk of invasion from the abyss?

There may be many regions with or without a separate plane and each may have separate and even competing structures. There is no need for all fey to be tied to a court; court politics may only be of interest to a limited set of fey. Possibilities range from having one or two high fey that dominate a rigid structure all the way down to the lowliest brownie and gremlin to there being multitudinous 'courts', each based around a creature slightly more influential than the others, with membership in constant flux. Moving towards the former emphasizes structure and the incredible power of alien beings and can work for showing how they are bound by rules, even if those rules are incomprehensible to mortals, while the later emphasizes the chaotic and variable nature frequently ascribed to fairies.\"\n",

In temperate climates, this could simply give you summer and winter courts, mapped roughly over the seelie and unseelie mentioned previously, or could be expanded to give spring, summer, fall, and winter courts. Spring naturally carries themes of birth and rebirth, youth, growth, and change. The days are getting longer and the future is bright. On the darker side, the young are weak, the nights are still cold, and the melting snow can uncover buried secrets or cause sudden floods. Summer is reaching adulthood, heat, and possibly drought. It is most often a time of plenty and the long days are filled with light. Areas tied to summer have towering trees, summer flowers, and may never see sunset. By contrast, they can also be battered by terrible storms. Autumn also carries themes of change and transition, though mixes them with preparation, exemplified by the harvest. The dark and hunger of winter are in sight. Autumn regions are brilliantly colored in yellows, oranges, and red, with fruit hanging low from trees, but the wind is cool and there is an underlying unease. Winter is the death of the world, a time of cold and hunger. Winter region are filled with snow and ice. Food is scarce and the inhabitants see others as either predators or prey. If the setting is more focused on other regions, the fey there could instead be tied to wet and dry seasons, with a court of rain, flood, or monsoon opposed to a court of drought. Island fey may be divided between courts of land, sea, and storm, or even further divided between freshwater and saltwater. In any case, the courts do not necessarily require moral alignments; a summer tornado and a winter blizzard can both deal death and destruction and both are equally natural. Wild Magic\"\n",

Benefits:  Whenever a Fate sphere effect you create would use an alignment, you may instead choose living or undead. Living and undead are considered opposite alignments that are 3 steps away from each other and do not have an alignment aura (such as determining additional penalties to the saving throw associated with the Enmity (word) talent or the Reveal Alignment (consecration) revealing whether the creatures inside are living or dead). You must possess the Death sphere to choose living or the Life sphere to choose undead. You may treat yourself as either living or undead when creating a consecration to exclude yourself from its effects (as you would normally be your own alignment and unaffected). In addition, whenever you use the Serendipity consecration, you may modify it with one of the following: Living Bastion (requires Life sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to sacred and only grants bonuses to living creatures (or penalizes undead creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any living creature healed by a magical effect inside this consecration heals up to an additional +1 hit point per Hit Dice they possess (to a maximum of the original amount healed). \\n Unliving Bastion (requires Death sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to profane and only grants bonuses to undead (or penalizes living creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any undead created inside this consecration gains an additional +1 hit points per Hit Dice they possess. Sphere effects modified with this feat are still treated as the original talent for all purposes, and as such, do not stack with those same talents unmodified by this feat. This prevents a character from benefiting from both the Hallow (word) against evil and the Hallow (word) against undead, as modified by this feat, against the same target or effect. Likewise, a regular Serendipity consecration and the Living Bastion-modified Serendipity consecration's effects would not stack, despite granting different bonus types. Note:  For the purposes of this feat, a living creature is any creature with a Constitution score. Example:  A Fate sphere caster uses the Divine Force (consecration) talent. Instead of using the Fate sphere caster's alignment, the caster chooses living and affects any undead, regardless of their alignment, and does not affect living creatures. That same caster uses the Enmity (word) talent, choosing undead and targeting a living creature.

GM Advice Rules Clarifications and Expansions Descriptors Unlike spells, talents in various Spheres of Power releases mostly lack descriptor tags. While in most cases the appropriate tag can be inferred for a given talent or entire sphere, for several options it is helpful to explicitly specify which talents bear the curse descriptor. Death Curse (ghost strike) Fate Curse (word) \\n Geas \\n Harm (word) \\n Mark of Judgment \\n Mercy (word) \\n Pain (word) \\n Serendipity (consecration), when used with Greater Serendipity \\n Truth (word) Alignment and Spheres of Power Unlike the core magic system, Spheres of Power mostly avoids associating alignment with magic\\u2014Fate, the sphere that actually has alignment as a core theme, being the notable exception. The reanimate ability of the Death sphere is not given the evil descriptor like animate undead, nor is applying the hallow word to protect against evil creatures good like protection from evil even though you must be good to do so. This is intentional. Spheres of Power was designed to be setting-agnostic, allowing GMs to have the magic in their game fit the feel of their world. Undead are not evil in all possible settings and in some warding against evil is more prudent than good. It is simple enough for a GM to add alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power, or to allow special abilities like the touch of evil granted power from the evil domain to function with sphere abilities as if they had alignment descriptors. They are most easily applied to alignment- dependent talents in Fate, the reanimate ability of the Death sphere (which would be evil in most settings), and the Summoning advanced talent of the Conjuration sphere (which would have the alignment descriptors, and possibly the elemental descriptors, of whatever is called). Certain rituals and incantations would also have an alignment descriptor\\u2014it is hard to justify Ragnarok as anything but evil, for instance, and any ritual duplicating a spell with an alignment descriptor should probably also have that descriptor. If a GM wishes a game in which alignment plays a more key role in magic, they also could add the good descriptor to all Life talents, evil to all Death talents, and chaos to all Destruction talents. In a setting where tampering with the mind is inherently evil, the Mind sphere could have the evil descriptor. And, of course, the GM could mix and match any or all of these suggestions to fit the setting. One other concern a GM ought to decide if adding alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power is to determine exactly how severe an evil act it is to use an evil talent and how great a good act it is to use a good talent. Does creating a zombie instantly change your alignment? Does it take a few castings? Or is it readily counteracted by using the zombie to rescue orphans and defeat demons? Different GMs have different opinions on this, and even different source books have offered different answers. Because of this, players may come into a game with very different expectations. It isn't fun for most players to suddenly become evil because of a single act when you weren't expecting it, so, like many rules interpretations, it's usually a good idea to discuss your decision with your players before it comes up. Other rule systems Removing Alignment Alignment is a foundational rule of Pathfinder, with many spells and abilities dependent on it. Even Spheres of Power, which makes minimal assumptions about alignment, uses it extensively in the Fate sphere and some feats. Pathfinder Unchained offers options, however, for excising alignment from the game and replacing it with loyalties. In a campaign using these rules, several adjustments to Spheres of Power should be made. Affected classes Ordained hunter (inquisitor archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Ordained hunters must have a loyalty to an alignment (or radiant or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The ordained hunter's empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms a critical hit against a creature whose loyalties are directly contrary to the ordained hunter's highest loyalty or reduces such an enemy to 0 hit points or lower. If using the subjective alignment variant, the ordained hunter is not required to have any particular loyalty and her empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms any critical hit or reduces any enemy to 0 hit points or lower. Utterdark Champion (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Utterdark champions must have a loyalty to evil (or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The utterdark champion's tenebrous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the utterdark champion's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the utterdark champion is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his tenebrous smite ability affects any creature caught in his area of darkness. The DR 10/ good granted by the unholy champion ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/radiant, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Warrior of Holy Light (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Warriors of holy light must have a loyalty to good (or radiance, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The warrior of holy light's luminous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the warrior of holy light's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the warrior of holy light is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his luminous smite ability affects any creature he attacks with his empowered weapon. The DR 10/evil granted by the warrior of the holy light ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/shadow, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Affected Feats Align Spell:  Replace with Fervent Spell, below. Anathema feats : The anathema ability affects any living or undead creature with loyalties opposed to your highest loyalty, even if positive energy would not normally damage the target.\"\n",

If the spell does not have variable, numeric effects, it instead has its saving throw DC and effective spell level decreased by 2 against creatures sharing one of the selected loyalties and increased by 2 against creatures with loyalties that directly contradict one of these loyalties (even if they share the other loyalty).

The effects of fervent spells are modified based on all loyalties chosen. If you lose a loyalty you chose for this feat, you may immediately choose a different loyalty you have to use it with. Alignment effects While removing alignment-based spells is suggested as an option in Pathfinder Unchained, removing alignment- based talents would make Fate much less attractive than other spheres. Instead, if you decide to remove alignment-based spells you should treat Fate talents as if you were using the subjective morality variant: Fate talents that affect an opposing alignment instead affect anyone with loyalties that directly contradict the caster's own. The talents Enmity and Metaphysical Cloak, because they interact with the default alignment system, should be removed in such a campaign.

GM Advice Rules Clarifications and Expansions Descriptors Unlike spells, talents in various Spheres of Power releases mostly lack descriptor tags. While in most cases the appropriate tag can be inferred for a given talent or entire sphere, for several options it is helpful to explicitly specify which talents bear the curse descriptor. Death Curse (ghost strike) Destruction Branding Taboo (blast shape) Fate Curse (word) \\n Geas \\n Harm (word) \\n Mark of Judgment \\n Mercy (word) \\n Pain (word) \\n Serendipity (consecration), when used with Greater Serendipity \\n Truth (word) Alignment and Spheres of Power Unlike the core magic system, Spheres of Power mostly avoids associating alignment with magic\\u2014Fate, the sphere that actually has alignment as a core theme, being the notable exception. The reanimate ability of the Death sphere is not given the evil descriptor like animate undead, nor is applying the hallow word to protect against evil creatures good like protection from evil even though you must be good to do so. This is intentional. Spheres of Power was designed to be setting-agnostic, allowing GMs to have the magic in their game fit the feel of their world. Undead are not evil in all possible settings and in some warding against evil is more prudent than good. It is simple enough for a GM to add alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power, or to allow special abilities like the touch of evil granted power from the evil domain to function with sphere abilities as if they had alignment descriptors. They are most easily applied to alignment- dependent talents in Fate, the reanimate ability of the Death sphere (which would be evil in most settings), and the Summoning advanced talent of the Conjuration sphere (which would have the alignment descriptors, and possibly the elemental descriptors, of whatever is called). Certain rituals and incantations would also have an alignment descriptor\\u2014it is hard to justify Ragnarok as anything but evil, for instance, and any ritual duplicating a spell with an alignment descriptor should probably also have that descriptor. If a GM wishes a game in which alignment plays a more key role in magic, they also could add the good descriptor to all Life talents, evil to all Death talents, and chaos to all Destruction talents. In a setting where tampering with the mind is inherently evil, the Mind sphere could have the evil descriptor. And, of course, the GM could mix and match any or all of these suggestions to fit the setting. One other concern a GM ought to decide if adding alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power is to determine exactly how severe an evil act it is to use an evil talent and how great a good act it is to use a good talent. Does creating a zombie instantly change your alignment? Does it take a few castings? Or is it readily counteracted by using the zombie to rescue orphans and defeat demons? Different GMs have different opinions on this, and even different source books have offered different answers. Because of this, players may come into a game with very different expectations. It isn't fun for most players to suddenly become evil because of a single act when you weren't expecting it, so, like many rules interpretations, it's usually a good idea to discuss your decision with your players before it comes up. Other rule systems Removing Alignment Alignment is a foundational rule of Pathfinder, with many spells and abilities dependent on it. Even Spheres of Power, which makes minimal assumptions about alignment, uses it extensively in the Fate sphere and some feats. Pathfinder Unchained offers options, however, for excising alignment from the game and replacing it with loyalties. In a campaign using these rules, several adjustments to Spheres of Power should be made. Affected classes Ordained hunter (inquisitor archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Ordained hunters must have a loyalty to an alignment (or radiant or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The ordained hunter's empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms a critical hit against a creature whose loyalties are directly contrary to the ordained hunter's highest loyalty or reduces such an enemy to 0 hit points or lower. If using the subjective alignment variant, the ordained hunter is not required to have any particular loyalty and her empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms any critical hit or reduces any enemy to 0 hit points or lower. Utterdark Champion (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Utterdark champions must have a loyalty to evil (or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The utterdark champion's tenebrous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the utterdark champion's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the utterdark champion is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his tenebrous smite ability affects any creature caught in his area of darkness. The DR 10/ good granted by the unholy champion ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/radiant, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Warrior of Holy Light (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Warriors of holy light must have a loyalty to good (or radiance, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The warrior of holy light's luminous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the warrior of holy light's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the warrior of holy light is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his luminous smite ability affects any creature he attacks with his empowered weapon. The DR 10/evil granted by the warrior of the holy light ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/shadow, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Affected Feats Align Spell:  Replace with Fervent Spell, below. Anathema feats : The anathema ability affects any living or undead creature with loyalties opposed to your highest loyalty, even if positive energy would not normally damage the target.\"\n",

Choose an end of the alignment spectrum (good, evil, lawful, chaotic); you must choose an alignment that you possess. The target of this word gains a +1 sacred bonus (profane bonus if you are evil; if you are neither good nor evil you must choose whether you grant sacred or profane bonuses with this sphere) to attack rolls, AC, and saving throws made against targets of your opposed alignment (evil for good, lawful for chaotic, etc.). This bonus increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels possessed. The target also gains immunity to any spell or sphere effect that possesses or exercises mental control over them (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects), so long as that effect originates from a creature who possesses your opposed alignment. If the target is already under the influence of such an effect, the target is allowed to make a new saving throw against the controlling effect. Success means the effect is suppressed for the duration of this word, but resumes when this word expires. This does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or projected spirit), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. Some Fate talents are marked (word).

This is only a curse effect when used with Greater Serendipity. Fate talents marked (consecration) grant you additional consecrations. Motifs Less precise than divination, but more proactive, (motif) talents give an auspician a glimpse at the pattern of Fate's tapestry and allow her to nudge one or two threads in a direction she chooses. Unless otherwise noted, a talent with the (motif) tag is cast as a standard action on a target with a range of touch and costs one spell point. A successful Will save negates the effect. While they normally have a duration of 1 hour per level, the target can also discharge a (motif) talent as an immediate action to gain an instantaneous or short-lived benefit, after which the effect ends. A given creature can never have more than one instance of a particular (motif) talent active on them at a time; a second casting at a higher caster level replaces the first, while a second casting at an equal or lower level has no effect.

      "            \"benefits\": \"You may create a glamer that makes a creature or object appear as something else. This allows you to attempt a Disguise check as part of casting the glamer, even without a disguise kit. This disguise is magical for the purposes of detecting magic or for spells and effects that allow a target to see through magical effects and illusions, and interacting with it allows for a Will save to disbelieve. You may disguise a target as something larger than itself (up to your maximum illusion size) but can only make something appear to be one size smaller than it actually is. Special Considerations Disbelief and Interaction:  When a creature interacts with an illusion, they may attempt a Will save to disbelieve. Generally speaking, simply observing an illusion is not enough; in order to 'interact' with an illusion a creature may spend a move action to carefully study the illusion. Additionally, any action that requires at least a move action and similarly engages directly with the illusion counts as interaction. For example, if there were a figment of a dragon, a character who tried to attack the dragon would receive a saving throw to disbelieve, as would a character who spent 1 minute attempting a Diplomacy check on the dragon. A character who just traded witty banter with the dragon as a free action would not, nor would a character who simply cast spells on herself or her allies and never directly confronted the illusory dragon. For a glamer, interacting generally works the same as for a figment, except that the interaction must be limited to something the glamer affects. For instance, grabbing a creature's ear would be an interaction for a human using disguise self to appear as an elf, but not for someone using a glamer to change their hair color. Similarly, visually studying someone would not grant a save against a glamer that purely changed their voice. Additionally, if you or a creature who has made their saving throw against one of your illusions declares that the illusion is, indeed, an illusion, other creatures so informed gain an automatic saving throw against the illusion. While multiple declarations from multiple creatures can produce multiple saving throws, only one saving throw can be generated per illusion by any single creature; if a declaration was unconvincing, the same person simply insisting again is not helpful. Sustained Disbelief:  Allies do not automatically disbelieve your illusions, but if they have been informed about and are familiar with your particular artistry and illusion style they gain a +5 circumstance bonus to all saves made to disbelieve your illusions. You may suppress this bonus by changing your personal style if you so desire. Creatures who successfully identify a sphere effect as belonging to the Illusion sphere as it is being cast, such as with a Spellcraft check or detect magic spell (or similar ability), also gain this +5 circumstance bonus to any Will saves made to disbelieve that illusion. If the GM feels it is appropriate, a creature who has interacted with multiple illusions in a day (especially if they have come from the same illusionist), might gain this bonus as well, to reflect how they are looking for patterns and checking and double-checking everything in front of them to avoid being fooled 'again'. This bonus would not apply when taking 10, taking 20, and would disallow checking a location multiple times in a row; double-checking is reflected in the bonus. Multiple Senses:  By default, the only sense that can be affected by a basic illusion is sight. However, certain talents marked with (sensory) allow the caster to create illusions that also produce illusionary sound, taste, smell, or even touch. The more complex an illusion is, the more talents it requires to be convincing, with the chart below serving as a guideline and the GM serving as the final arbiter for what talents are required to create a specific illusion. Creating an illusion without the necessary (sensory) talents often leads to disbelief; whenever a creature interacts with an illusion in a way that requires a (sensory) talent it does not possess, they may attempt a Will save to disbelieve with a +5 bonus. This bonus is cumulative for each missing (sensory) talent. This is in addition to simply learning the sensory experience is not there (for example, if a creature walks through an illusionary wall they will learn they can pass through that wall whether or not they discover the reason why is that the wall is illusionary). If the GM deems it appropriate, certain other situations might allow a target to gain a similar +5 bonus to their Will saves (for example, a creature being damaged by illusionary 'fire' that is normally immune to fire damage). Table: Example Illusions Example of Illusion \\n Additional Required Talents \\n \\n \\n An illusionary wall \\n Illusionary Touch (if felt) \\n \\n \\n A glen full of trees \\n Complex Illusion \\n \\n \\n A warrior blocking the target's way \\n Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch (to engage in combat with target) \\n \\n \\n A table laden with food \\n Illusionary Odor, Illusionary Touch (if consumed by target) \\n \\n \\n A room filled with fire \\n Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch \\n \\n \\n An army of orcs chasing the target \\n Complex Illusion, Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch (to engage in combat with target) Cover and Concealment:  Figments and glamers provide concealment if they block line of sight. A figment of a wall, for example, would grant total concealment unless the attacker disbelieved the illusion, whereas a figment of fog would only grant partial concealment. Glamers that are used to change the size of a creature to appear larger than it is grants a 10% miss chance for each size increase due to concealment. If a creature is glamered to appear larger and its larger size would provide a cover bonus to another target, it instead grants this same concealment bonus to miss chance. Glamers and figments with the shadow descriptor which grant a miss chance or concealment also grant soft cover. Illusionary Creatures:  If creating an illusionary creature, your illusion has an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and an AC and touch AC equal to 10 + its size modifier + 1/2 your caster level + your casting ability modifier. An illusionary creature may provide a flanking bonus against targets who fail to disbelieve it. Any creature who strikes an illusionary creature in combat (unless augmented by Illusionary Touch) receives the standard +5 circumstance bonus to disbelieve it, and any creature struck by the illusionary creature receives the same bonus (unless augmented by Illusionary Touch 2x). All actions that an illusionary creature performs must be contained within the figment of the illusion that created it, regardless of the size of the illusionary creature itself. Powerful Senses:  Senses such as see in darkness, x-ray vision, mistsight, or greensight that are designed to penetrate specific sorts of occlusion or display vision differently do not automatically interact with illusions the way they do unaltered reality, and thus tricking a character with such a sense is a difficult task, but not impossible. For example, when creating an illusionary wall to fool a creature with x-ray vision, one could create an illusion that 'looks' like a wall being looked through with x-ray vision. However, creating an illusion that would trick such senses can create obvious signs of trickery with those that do not possess that sight (for example, the illusion of a forest would look suspicious to a character with greensight if he could not see through it, but making the illusionary forest transparent would look suspicious to any of their allies who do not possess greensight). The Selective Illusions talent can be helpful in overcoming this problem in certain situations. Complex and Exotic Senses:  Illusions can foil all forms of perception, even unusual forms that a creature might possess. Use the following list when dealing with unusual senses. Blindsense:  Illusionary Odor and Illusionary Sound \\n Blindsight:  Illusionary Odor, Illusionary Sound, and Illusionary Touch \\n Detect Magic:  Manipulate Aura \\n Echolocation:  Illusionary Sound through air, Illusionary Touch through water \\n Scent or Keen Scent:  Illusionary Odor \\n Lifesense:  Manipulate Aura, Illusionary Touch \\n Thoughtsense or Detect Thoughts:  Implausible Deniability feat \\n Tremorsense:  Illusionary Touch For figments, if you do not possess all of the indicated (sensory) talents required to convincingly create the illusion, creatures with that sense are automatically treated as interacting with your figment the first time the figment comes within range of that sense, and any Will save made to disbelieve the figment while within range of that sense is made with the standard +5 circumstance bonus for each missing talent. For glamers, every sensory talent you lack to fool the listed sense causes the creature affected by that glamer to suffer a -2 penalty to any skill bonus or Disguise check granted by that glamer vs. that creature, and reduces any miss chance granted by the glamer by 10%. If the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature may ignore all other effects of the glamer. For Suppressions, if all senses that make up the complex sense are suppressed by the effect, the complex sense fails to penetrate that area. Trick As a standard action, you may create small, simple illusions called tricks. Unless otherwise stated, a trick persists for 1 minute per level or until dismissed.\"\n",

Using this trick a second time immediately end the duration of the previous casting of this trick. As an illusion you may create a distorting figment. This creates a figment that causes a distortion as described above. As an illusion you may create a distorting glamer. This functions in all other ways as the trick except it does not allow for a Will save to ignore the miss chance and has the duration of a standard illusion. As a glamer, the miss chance only applies to attacks made against the target. Author's Note:  Blurs created with this talent do not need to be visual, or purely visual; They can incorporate elements that distort other forms of perception based upon what (sensory) talents you possess. A creature can ignore the miss chance granted by blur if they lack senses for every (sensory) effect you incorporate into the effect; A purely visual blur can have its miss chance ignored by a creature that closes its eyes. To determine if a sense is sufficiently possessed by a creature when determining if they can ignore the miss chance provided by the blur effect, they must be capable of pin-pointing the space of a creature only using that sense; For example, humans do not normally qualify as possessing the necessary senses to pin-point a creature by smell or taste alone (unless they gain other senses such as scent, keen scent, or some forms of blindsense).\"\n",

The combined size and range of these figments must still be within your maximum illusion size, but each component can appear differently and behave differently. While each component can be given its own set of programmed instructions, you can only actively control one component at a time. For example, when creating an illusion of a tavern, a creature with this talent could create a bustling group of people inside the tavern as part of the same illusion. The caster could only control one such illusionary person at a time though; and the rest would only perform their last set of instructions. Giving a component a new set of instructions is a move action. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a complex illusion, it sees through the entire figment rather than only one component part. When creating glamers, you may spend an additional spell point to affect multiple different targets with the same glamer so long as they are all within your illusion range and the combined size of affected targets does not exceed your maximum illusion size. For example, if your maximum illusion size is Large, you could affect with this talent 2 Medium-sized targets or 4 Small-sized targets with your glamer.

Note:  If you suppress every sense required to fool a complex or exotic sense, that sense cannot automatically detect that creature. Invisibility:  When suppressing vision, you allow the target to attempt Stealth checks to hide even while being observed. This does not grant the invisible condition, but counts as invisibility for effects that interact with it (such as spells that negate it), and therefore does not stack with the invisibility spell or other, similar effects. The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks per caster level (maximum 20). Objects cannot attempt Stealth checks, but become difficult to see, requiring a Perception check to find with a DC equal to 10 + their size bonus + your caster level. If you are undetected by a creature, you gain total concealment against it, as well as a +2 bonus to attack rolls against it, and you may ignore its Dexterity bonus to AC. Silence:  When suppressing sound, you cause the creature to become muffled. The target loses its armor check penalty to Stealth and reduces the penalty associated with sniping by 1 per caster level (minimum 0). However, the target also suffers a 5% chance of arcane spell failure per caster level (maximum 100%) when using magic that requires verbal components or is language-based. Touchless:  When suppressing touch, it becomes difficult to detect the target by feel. If the target touches or makes a melee attack against a creature from Stealth, that creature must succeed at a Perception check to even feel that they have been touched or attacked (DC 10 + 1 per caster level, -1 per point of damage dealt). The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus per caster level (maximum +20) to Sleight of Hand checks made to pick pockets. Odorless:  When suppressing taste and smell, the affected target inflicts other creatures attempting to track it or discover it through smell (such as with the scent special ability) a penalty to their Perception or Survival checks equal to -1 per caster level (maximum 20). This also applies to checks made to detect poison or identify the target via smell or taste. Additionally, if the target attempts to use smell to affect other targets (such as making them sickened or nauseated through the stench ability), targets gain a +1 bonus per caster level (maximum 20) to their saving throws.

You cannot create or lower an aura's perceived caster level more than up to twice your caster level. Making an aura appear to have a caster level of 0 completely conceals a magical aura as if the target was non-magical. You may make these changes as part of creating an illusion (including altering or erasing the aura of the illusion itself), or independently as a trick with a duration of up to 1 day per caster level. As you create a figment or a glamer, you may apply this sensory talent to change what sphere of magic it belongs to for the purpose of people identifying the school of magic or sphere effect via the Spellcraft skill or detect magic (or similar spell or ability). For example, if you change the apparent sphere from Illusion to Destruction, any attempt to identify the sphere effect with the Spellcraft skill will reveal it as belonging to the Destruction sphere, not the Illusion sphere. Instead of 'disbelieving' a manipulated aura, a target examining this aura through detection magic must succeed at a magic skill check against the creator of the aura. If the check succeeds, the detection effect functions normally detecting both the true aura and this trick, but on a failure the detection magic believes the manipulated aura and does not detect this trick. Effects that grant bonuses to Will saves against illusions add those bonuses to this magic skill check. Artifacts are too powerful to have their auras hidden or altered in this manner.

Surreal Feats Surreal feats are feats that use or rely upon the irrational and unpredictable substance known as shadowstuff. All surreal feats are spell-like abilities that are treated as (figment, shadow) illusions for the purposes of interacting with other effects. Characters with the Shadow Infusion talent or the create reality class feature may spend spell points in place of shadow points to activate abilities granted by surreal feats. The first time you gain a surreal feat you also gain a shadow pool as the fey adept class feature, except it only contains a number of shadow points equal to the total number of surreal feats you possess.

Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n An illusory wind surrounds fills the caster's illusion range, acting as per the category 3 wind of the Weather sphere + 1 category per 7 caster levels.

Illusionist's Guide A common misconception with illusion magic is that an illusion is not real. This is only partially correct. Illusions are real, they just are not what they appear to be. They do have an effect on reality, but rely heavily on belief to complete the effect. What is an illusion? Mostly it is whatever is convenient at the time. An illusion contains elements of many other spheres, but is its own unique effect. Illusions alter perception, but are not a mind affecting, so do not require a mind or even the physiology needed to process the sensation. Illusions alter light and sound but are not dark, light, or sonic effects. Investigating and Interacting In a world deeply entrenched in magic there is almost nothing that is \\\"obviously\\\" trickery. If part of your person was to go through a wall it is equally possible that you are incorporeal as it is that the wall is an illusion. If a fire was unable to be doused by water it is equally likely that the flames are supernaturally hot through the power of destruction magic as it is that the inferno is imaginary. Senses have a way of justifying their input no matter how alien. In anything but the most extreme circumstances, interaction and investigation is a better model for creatures interacting with illusions. It would be impossible to categorize every potential interaction and expected result but as a general rule \\\"interacting\\\" occurs when a creature takes an action based on assumed qualities, such as the appearance or sensation of an illusion. If the illusion fails to possess those qualities interaction has taken place. Upon interacting with a figment, a creature is allowed to make a Will save to disbelieve the effect. For each subsequent interaction the creature gains a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus to the Will save for that specific figment. This bonus is lost if a creature spends a round without interacting with the figment. Upon interacting with a creature or object under the effects of a glamer, a creature acts as if any skill bonus granted by the glamer is two lower and any miss chance granted by the glamer is reduced by 10%. If the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature automatically succeeds on further checks against the same glamer and may ignore all other effects of the glamer. Glamers with the shadow descriptor cannot have their granted skill bonuses or miss chance reduced to lower than half (rounded up) by creatures interacting with them. As a move action a creature may investigate suspected figments. This becomes an interaction with any and all adjacent figments.\"\n",

Anyone who finds obvious evidence of trickery (ex: throws a rock through an illusionary wall) automatically disbelieves the illusion. You may only create visual illusions although certain talents may be taken to add more senses. The more complex an illusion is, the more talents it requires to be convincing, with the chart below serving as a guideline and the GM serving as the final arbiter for what talents are required to create a specific illusion.

This functions in all other ways as the trick except it does not allow for a Will save to ignore the miss chance and has the duration of a standard illusion. Stacking Miss Chance:  There are several sources that potentially cause an attack to automatically miss that stack. Rolling percentile three or more times for each attack against a well-prepared target can definitely slow down combat. Alternatively, when calculating multiple miss chances from separate sources, a single roll will suffice to produce the same probability of a miss. Greatest counts for full. Second-highest counts for 1/2. Third-highest counts for 1/4. Fourth-highest counts for 1/8. And so on, rounded down to the nearest 5%. When using this method, the miss chance may become greater than 50%, but should never be allowed to be higher than 95%.

It is assumed that the \\\"dragon\\\" would attack any creature it was aware of in the room, but the thief has not confirmed that the \\\"dragon\\\" is actually aware of his presence so no interaction has taken place when the \\\"dragon\\\" remains stationary. The Warrior:  Loudly rushes into position to flank the \\\"dragon\\\" while screaming a battle cry. It is assumed this would alert the \\\"dragon\\\" but it does not move.

Affecting Complex or Exotic Senses Illusion can foil all forms of perception, even unusual forms that many creatures possess. Use the following list when dealing with unusual senses. Detect Magic:  Manipulate Aura (Sensory: Magic) \\n Blindsense:  Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell) and Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound) \\n Blindsight:  Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell), Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound), and Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) \\n Darkvision:  Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) (However, keep in mind that darkvision is monochromatic. To fool darkvision at the same time as full colored vision should require Complex Illusion to maintain colored and non-colored elements separately.) \\n Color Blindness:  Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) (same caveat as darkvision) \\n Echolocation:  Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound) through air, Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) through water \\n Scent or Keen Scent:  Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell) \\n Lifesense:  Manipulate Aura (Sensory: Magic) (unless the description of the specific sense is extraordinary or mentions/ implies heat, in that case Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) is required instead) \\n Low-light Vision:  Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) \\\"sight\\\" that can see through objects: Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) (Senses such as See in Darkness, X-Ray Vision, Mistsight, Greensight that can penetrate specific sorts of occlusion only require sight to be fooled. However, creating an illusion that they would be expected to penetrate is suspicious enough to count as obvious signs of trickery.) \\n Thoughtsense or Detect Thoughts:  Implausable Deniability feat (Sensory: Mind), also Phantom Mind despite not being a sensory talent as a side effect may create figments that interact with these senses as a creature with an Int score up to half of the level of the caster. For glamers, Manipulate Aura can hide or modify the apparent intellect of a creature adding or subtracting up to twice their caster level. For this purpose creatures with an Intelligence 0 are treated as invisible to thoughtsense. This does not render your mind immune to being read. \\n Tremorsense:  Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) \\n Trueseeing:  Effects that automatically see through illusions such as the truesight fey adept class feature or the true seeing spell (or True Seeing advanced talent) are only half as effective against (shadow) illusions. For (shadow): Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight), Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound), Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch), Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell) and Manipulate Aura (Sensory: Magic). Keep in mind that the skill bonus granted by the glamer is already halved. Trueseeing has no effect on (suppression) talents. For figments, if you do not possess all of the indicated (sensory) talent(s) associated with that form of perception, creatures with that sense are automatically treated as interacting with your figment the first time it comes within range of the sense. Interacting in this manner allows for a Will save to disbelieve the illusion with a +2 circumstance bonus for each missing talent. For glamers, every sensory talent you lack to fool the listed sense, the creature acts as if any skill bonus granted by the glamer is two lower and any miss chance granted by the glamer is reduced by 10%. If the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature may ignore all other effects of the glamer. For suppressions, if all senses that make up the complex sense are suppressed by the effect, the complex sense fails to penetrate that area. When using Silence as a glamer, the affected creature treats all complex senses with all their base components suppressed as having range of 0. Illusions That Create Cover Or Concealment Figments and glamers provide concealment if they block line of sight. A figment of a wall for example would grant total concealment unless the attacker disbelieved the illusion, whereas a figment of fog would only grant partial concealment. Shadow Figments that grant a miss chance or concealment also grant soft cover. Glamers that are used to change the size of a creature to appear larger grants a 10% miss chance for each size increase due to concealment. If a creature is glamered to appear larger it would provide a cover bonus to another target it grants the same concealment bonus to miss chance. Shadow Glamers that grant a miss chance or concealment also grant soft cover. Based on the description of their manifestation, at the GM's discretion other glamers modified by the shadow descriptor (such as Illusionary Disguise) could instead grant up to a +2 bonus to AC of any type reflected by the description of the glamer. Mastering Deception Illusion is among the most versatile of magics, and as such odds are illusion can solve almost any problem. If you possess Shadow Infusion, time and spell points you definitely have all the tools you need to handle 90% of non-combat situations. Contrary to popular belief illusion magic is actually one of the better combat options despite a lack of burst damage for offense.\"\n",

Illusions, even simple tricks, can be used to collaborate and communicate over long distances, through barriers, and with clever application of the right talents (such as Manipulate Aura) even across large gulfs of time. Often, the best use of a battlefield illusion is to have enemies commit bold errors, not dissuade action. Have your illusionary allies or decoys soak up attacks of opportunity and readied actions. This a quick and easy way to allow your party to move unimpeded and engage in what would otherwise be very risky tactics, such as breaking an enemy line. Generally it is a better use of an illusion, especially a trick, to make a foe waste time, energy, and resources than it is to prevent them from acting at all. Gently guide your enemy to give them neither the time nor reason to test for deception. It is usually best to avoid the total obstruction of fully solid wall that will come into question the moment opposition reaches it and has nothing better to do than investigate it. Instead it is better to leave overt openings or obvious detours to direct foes to a choice location rather than risk one lucky Will save that will reveal your barrier as the illusion it is.

The intended purpose of a figment need not be only one of these things, universally applicable or even uniform throughout the entire space occupied by the figment. As an example: A wall with windows and a doorway. Most of the wall could be described as an obstruction, the windows being tactically attractive for ranged combatants who wish to use them for their low cover without blocking their fire and the doorway attractive to melee combatants who see it as the path of least resistance to close distance with their foes. This entire wall could be sitting over a deadly fall making the entire area appear to be \\\"safe\\\". Thematics and Theatrics There is not nor should there be any assumed fluff for how the sensation of an illusion manifests. Illusionists should be free to be creative when explaining how the mechanical benefit without shying away from personal flair. Some examples of the freedom that should not only be allowed but encouraged are given below. Decoys need not follow the model of the mirror image spell and be limited to strictly being exact copies of the creature that they are attached to. There is no reason the mechanical effect cannot be expressed as a small squad of orcish bodyguards, a handful of taunting fey, frightening spirits or animated objects interposing themselves between you and attacks while looking menacing. Blur (despite sharing a name with a spell that describes the effect as making a creature hazy with their outline shifting and wavering) can be expressed as anything that could be expected to interfere with clearly observing a target. Shattered glass, refractions, falling leaves, swarms of insects or a flock of sparrows could all create a concealment miss chance. Disguises don't have to be used for deception solely to hide an appearance, they could also add to the original form. Applying a disguise for other benefits such as Hostile Glamers could manifest as the original target but on fire. Perhaps you want to make a disguise with Shadow Infusion to gain the cover bonus to armor class, this could manifest as the original target but with an ominous spirit interposed upon their form. Illusionary Labyrinth implies getting lost or being forced to turn around in confusion, but it need not be the only explanation for using an illusion to control the movement of a victim. This could instead be black tentacles extending from a non-euclidian void dragging their horrified victims to unknown destinations. A mass of webs, tar or thorns that prevents movement could equally explain a victim believing that they are unable to move. Illusionary Terrain not only doesn't have to be a change of the ground, but only describing it that way fails to explain how it also applies to other kinds of movement such as flight, levitation or swimming. A space filled with slime, tornados or half manifested spiritual hands clawing at all who enter the space however does. To summarize, whatever the mechanics say an illusion does is what it does mechanically only. The explanation of how or why the illusion appears to work, however should not only be the duty but the pleasure of the illusionist that created it. The more strange, comical, horrifying and personally thematic that explanation is the better. As always, do respect the tone and themes of the game you are playing and more importantly the work your game master puts into maintaining a sense of atmosphere and the suspension of disbelief. Immunity and Susceptibility There is a rare creature on occasion that notes that it is completely immune to illusions. This is usually based on the presumption that an illusion is a purely visual effect. GMs should be encouraged to evaluate why a creature may be immune to illusions and see if the rules provided for complex senses are more applicable. If a creature is still deemed to still be immune to illusions use the rules for trueseeing (as described in the section entitled: Affecting Complex or Exotic Senses). Sensation for the purposes of illusion magic is a separate thing from the mind or biology and neither a mind nor the necessary biology is required to be affected by an illusion. Constructs, plants, oozes, undead and many vermin lack eyes, ears, noses, nerves and anything that we would recognize as a mind, but have always been affected by illusion magic as easily as any other creature. Unless specifically noted, normally lacking the ability to experience a sensation created by an illusion does not render a creature automatically unaffected by it. Clarifications\"\n",

The hypervitalized creature gains the following benefits: Immunity to bleed, death effects, damage from positive energy effects, disease (magical and non-magical), paralysis, poison, sleep effects, aging effects, and stunning. \\n Not subject to nonlethal damage of any kind. Immunity to damage or drain to its ability scores, as well as to exhaustion and fatigue effects.

The target is not at risk of death from massive damage, not disabled at 0 hit points, and at negative hit points is unconscious but stable, even if exceeding the Constitution score. It can only be killed if the body is deliberately destroyed, such as being immolated or disintegrated, or by allowing the effect to expire while at negative hit points greater than their Constitution score. Creatures that possess abilities that allow them to stay conscious at 0 or fewer hit points still fall unconscious if they would normally die from the amount of damage they have received. \\n Does not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep.\"\n",

You must possess the Death sphere to choose living or the Life sphere to choose undead. You may treat yourself as either living or undead when creating a consecration to exclude yourself from its effects (as you would normally be your own alignment and unaffected). In addition, whenever you use the Serendipity consecration, you may modify it with one of the following: Living Bastion (requires Life sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to sacred and only grants bonuses to living creatures (or penalizes undead creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess.

Likewise, a regular Serendipity consecration and the Living Bastion-modified Serendipity consecration's effects would not stack, despite granting different bonus types. Note:  For the purposes of this feat, a living creature is any creature with a Constitution score. Example:  A Fate sphere caster uses the Divine Force (consecration) talent. Instead of using the Fate sphere caster's alignment, the caster chooses living and affects any undead, regardless of their alignment, and does not affect living creatures. That same caster uses the Enmity (word) talent, choosing undead and targeting a living creature.

This does not stack with any fast healing it might already have. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n For one minute, the caster gains fast healing equal to half caster level.

This is a positive energy effect. Creatures harmed by positive energy take an equal amount of damage with a Will save to reduce the damage by half. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n The next time within 1 day per caster level that the caster is slain by hit point damage, he is restored to 1 hit point at the start of his next turn. This ability otherwise works as the Resuscitate talent. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n All creatures within long range receive temporary hit points equal to caster level.

If this expunge is used on a creature that is already spellburned, they immediately suffer the normal spell point damage, plus the amount of spell point damage they suffer each round due to being spellburned. Multiple instances of this expunge do not stack; use the highest caster level when determining the spell point damage. A creature may spend a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity to re-center their magic, ending the effects of this ability without making a save. Table: Spellburned Caster Level \\n Burn Size \\n \\n \\n 1st \\n 1d2 \\n \\n \\n 5th \\n 1d3 \\n \\n \\n 9th \\n 1d4 \\n \\n \\n 13th \\n 1d6 \\n \\n \\n 17th \\n 1d8 \\n \\n \\n 21st \\n 2d6 Note:  The expunge ability is created with the intention of being used upon other spellcasters that utilize the Spheres of Power system of magic, but can be made to work with other systems of magic as well. When used against a spellcaster that utilizes the core system of magic in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a GM may allow it to damage spell slots or spells prepared. To calculate which spells are affected, total the number of spell point damage taken. The caster suffering from the spell point damage talent may then choose an amount of spell slots or prepared spells to lose. They must choose an amount of spells that amount to the points cost, following this list to determine the value of each spell level in spell points: Level 1-2:  1 spell point,  Level 3-5:  2 spell points,  Level 6-8:  3 spell points,  Level 9:  4 spell points. If there is an amount of spell points remaining that the spellcaster cannot sacrifice spells of a level to make up for without going above the amount (for example, only losing 1 spell point but not having any 1st or 2nd level spell slots/prepared spells left), they may ignore the remainder without sacrificing additional spell slots. When used on creatures with psionic manifesting (Psionics Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press), the creature loses a number of power points equal to the number of spell points that would have been lost multiplied by 1 + its Hit Dice/4. Manabond You can create a manabond between yourself and the targeted creature as either a swift action made as part of successfully using an (expunge) or (manipulation) talent that costs a spell point and targets a creature, or as a move action by touching a creature and spending a spell point. A manabond lasts for as long as you concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. You cannot create a manabond with yourself. Concentration on a manabond only requires a swift action, which cannot be further reduced unless otherwise specified. When creating a manabond, you may add a single (manabond) talent that you possess to the effect. When creating a manabond, you are considered the host of the manabond, and the target considered the recipient. You can only be the host of a single manabond, and cannot be the recipient of multiple manabonds at the same time. If a caster attempts to place a second manabond on a target, they must succeed at a magic skill check. If they succeed, the other manabond is suppressed, causing it to remain active and ongoing as long as it is maintained, but having no effect on the recipient until the suppressing manabond has ended. If they fail, their manabond is suppressed, and the original manabond remains active. Even when suppressed, a host may still pinpoint the location of the recipient. A manabond is a direct, invisible and intangible line of energy that connects the host and the recipient, and remains active up to close range, beyond which the manabond breaks, and the effect ends. You can always pinpoint your recipient's exact location (although this does not negate any concealment they may possess). When you gain the Mana sphere, you gain the following (manabond) talent:\"\n",

When creating this manabond, you can choose to apply either a +1 competence bonus or a -1 penalty to their caster level with all sphere effects from a single sphere, chosen at the time of casting. This bonus and penalty increases by 1 for every 8 caster levels you possess, and cannot reduce a creature's caster level below 1. Manipulation/Amp You learn to bend the rules of magic to your advantage. As a standard action, you may use any (manipulation) that you possess, up to a range of close. You must remain within this range when maintaining a (manipulation) through concentration. When you gain the Mana sphere, you gain the Shuffle manipulation. Some manipulations are also marked (amp). (Amp) talents modify the nature of a sphere effect as it is cast, or amplify the next sphere effect cast that it can apply to. (Amp) talents cannot modify sphere effects that are modified by metamagic feats, and likewise a sphere effect modified by an (amp) talent cannot be modified by a metamagic feat. Only a single (amp) may affect a sphere effect at any time; if multiple (amp) effects are used on a single sphere effect, the spherecaster creating the sphere effect must decide which functions. (Amp) talents may also not be affected by other (amp) talents, nor may metamagic feats be applied to them. Unless otherwise specified, you can activate (amp) talents as an immediate action made as part of creating a sphere effect that it can be applied to, acting as an extension to that sphere effect rather than creating two sphere effects. If you fail to cast the sphere effect, the (amp) is wasted and does not carry over to any other sphere effect you attempt to create. Alternatively, you can spend a standard action to allow a willing ally within range of your manipulate to gain the benefits of that (amp) talent on the next eligible sphere effect they cast before the start of your next turn. Some (amp) talents reduce an effect's caster level. If the caster level would be reduced to 0 or lower, the sphere effect fails and any spell points or actions spent are wasted. Any saving throws required by (amp) talents use your Mana sphere caster level, unless otherwise specified.\"\n",

The caster of an effect changed by this ability is allowed a Will Save to ignore the effects of Shuffle for that effect. Choose one of the following effects to apply to the area at the time of casting: Chaotic Rewiring:  By actively ruining magical cohesiveness in the area of your shuffle, magic becomes trickier to control. When a spherecaster targets one of their allies with a targeted sphere effect in the area of their shuffle, it instead randomly selects a target from all targetable allies within the area, even if they are otherwise out of range. If the spherecaster targets an enemy with a targeted sphere effect, it instead targets a random targetable enemy within the area. At 10th caster level, any sphere effect that targets a creature within the area of the shuffle randomly targets an enemy or ally within the area, regardless of the original target, as long as they would otherwise be able to be targeted. If the sphere effect targets an area centered within your shuffle, it instead randomly changes its targeted location to a nearby area 10 feet away from the original point it targeted in a random direction (roll 1d8 to determine, moving clockwise). This distance increases by 5 feet for every 4 caster levels you possess. \\n Elemental Rewiring:  Choose two energy types from the following list: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You convert all energy damage of the first damage type into the second damage type. At 7th caster level, you add sonic to this list. At 12th caster level, you add force to this list. Only one shuffle can be in effect in an area at a time, with any attempt to overlap areas requiring a magic skill check against the MSD of the initial shuffle effect. On success, the initial shuffle effect is dispelled, but on a failure the shuffle effect fails to cast. Mana Talent Types Some talents are marked (expunge). These grant you additional ways to expunge energy. Some talents are marked (manipulation). These grant you additional ways of manipulating energy. Some manipulation talents are also marked (amp). These modify the nature of a sphere effect as it is cast, or amplifies the next sphere effect it can apply to. Some talents are marked (manabond).

      "            \"benefits\": \"Prerequisites:  Mana sphere, caster level 5th. You can modify magic in such a way that it understands language, and becomes more like a pact. Oathbreaker's Spell (amp):  You can spend two spell points to modify a non-harmless sphere effect so that it punishes those who break an agreement. As part of casting the amplified sphere effect, the spherecaster must select a target. The target of the amplified sphere effect must be willing, or else the amplification fails to modify the sphere effect. An agreement, written or verbal, must be struck between the target and the spherecaster that created the amplified effect. So long as the target abides by this agreement, the sphere effect does not take effect. If at any time the target violates the agreement, the sphere effect immediately triggers as if cast, targeting the creature who violated the contract or their current location if it does not target creatures. This ability recognizes the spirit of the agreement, and does not trigger the sphere effect if the agreement is violated unknowingly or unwillingly. The magical agreement only lasts for up to 1 day per caster level, after which the amplified spell is discharged harmlessly. At 15th caster level, the agreement may last for as long as the spherecaster desires, even indefinitely. The amplified sphere effect gains the (curse) descriptor. \\n Contracted Spell (amp):  You can spend two spell points to modify a harmless sphere effect that targets one creature so that its benefits are tied to an agreement. As part of casting the amplified sphere effect, the spherecaster who created the sphere effect must strike a written or verbal agreement between themselves and the target of the amplified sphere effect must accept the conditions. This agreement can be a promise, a goal that must be achieved before the amplified sphere effect ends or a task to be repeated intermittently, or a warning to not commit a certain prohibited behavior. If the agreement is violated (or not completed in time), the amplified sphere effect immediately ends and all of its effects are reversed (even instantaneous effects; afflictions removed will return, hit points healed will be undone and so forth). This amplification understands the spirit of the agreement, and will not consider it a violation if the target unwillingly or unknowingly violates the agreement. The target always knows if a specific action they take will trigger a violation of the agreement. The magical agreement lasts for as long as the amplified sphere effect, or up to 1 day per caster level if the sphere effect had a duration of instantaneous. At 15th caster level, the magical agreement may last for as long as the spherecaster desires, even indefinitely. \\n Written Spell (amp):  You can spend a spell point to convert an instantaneous sphere effect that targets either one creature or an area and allows for a saving throw to avoid its effects into magical writing. The sphere effect remains dormant and does not trigger until a creature approaches its range and reads the magical writing, where it then activates, targeting the creature that read it or their square. Only one piece of magical writing can be written on a surface or parchment, and a creature can only trigger one magical writing each turn. You can instruct creatures on how to read the magical writing without triggering it as a standard action. The magical writing remains for 1 day per caster level but the spherecaster who created the sphere effect cannot regain any spell points spent on the sphere effect until it triggers. The writing is treated as a magical trap and may be disabled with Disable Device check (DC = 10 + the spherecaster's caster level + the spherecaster's casting ability modifier). Both you and the spherecaster who created the effect can remove and dispel the writing as a standard action without a check. At 15th caster level, the magical writing remains indefinitely or until removed.\"\n",

      "            \"benefits\": \"Prerequisites:  Mana sphere; Protection sphere, War sphere, Life sphere (Diagnose) or Mind sphere (Project Thoughts). Benefits:  Through use of specialized magic, you can enhance all of your manabonds. You may apply the effects of the following abilities to any manabond you create if you possess the associated sphere or talent. Protection sphere:  Recipients of your manabonds are considered as if they were under the effects of your aegis for the purposes of effects such as the Community and Status talents. \\n Mind sphere (Project Thoughts):  All recipients of your manabonds may communicate telepathically with you and any other recipient of your manabonds. \\n War sphere:  You may rally recipients of your manabond as if they were within range of one of your totems. \\n Life sphere (Diagnose):  Instead of a swift action, you may spend a free action to learn the condition of all recipients of your manabond. You may spend a spell point once per turn as a free action to learn the exact details of these conditions, as per the Diagnose talent. If you also possess the Soulmate talent, you may always redirect healing as per the talent when you have an active manabond with a creature, even if it is not a Soulmate manabond. Archetypes Specializing in Mana \\n Arcanopulser  [CS] \\n Arcanopulsers are Elementalists who specialize in mana blasts. \\n Corteggiare \\n Corteggiare are Bards who are particularly good at blending magic into their music. \\n Spellvampire \\n Spellvampires are Shifters who can steal the magic and powers of their foes. \\n \\n Wild Magic \\n Wild Magic Generator \\n \\n Wild Magic Table \\n \\n \\n d100 \\n Result \\n \\n \\n 1 \\n The caster becomes blind, but gains 60 feet blindsight that can only be used to see creatures that can store spell points, as well as any magical effects, terrain or items. This lasts for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n The caster's target (if any) can always sense the location of the caster for 1 hour per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 3 \\n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of their choice from any sphere they qualify for for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 4 \\n A flux of magic enhances all effects. An area of potent magic is created in a 20-foot radius around the caster, which remains for 24 hours. Any effects cast within this radius are treated as if any variable components rolled their maximum possible number. \\n \\n \\n 5 \\n Mana becomes as clear as light. You detect magic constantly as the base Divination sphere ability for 1 hour per caster level, and any attempt to identify magic items or effects with a Spellcraft check are treated as if you rolled a natural 20 on the check. \\n \\n \\n 6 \\n Until the end of the caster's next turn, all spell point costs the caster must pay are waived. \\n \\n \\n 7 \\n Magic becomes obvious. Any creature being targeted by a magical effect within close range of the caster automatically knows the type of effect and the source of the effect. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 8 \\n Antimagic bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid antimagic, removing 1 spell point from any creature that walks into it (or applying a -1 penalty to a random mental ability score if they do not have spell points), but granting them a +2 bonus to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 9 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 10 \\n Your manabonds fuse incredibly easily. You may create a manabond as a free action to any creature within close range until the end of your next turn. Unwilling creatures get a Will save to resist this. \\n \\n \\n 11 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 12 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls are ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 13 \\n The effect's spell point cost is reduced to 0. \\n \\n \\n 14 \\n Power becomes absolute. All penalties or bonuses to caster levels, magic skill bonuses and magic skill defenses are negated in a close range radius around you. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 15 \\n In a medium range, the weather immediately shifts 1d4 severity levels higher for Precipitation, but the clouds instead rain bright blue globs of mana. If the severity level is at least 4, each round the caster is exposed to the skies, they have a 5% chance of being struck by electrical mana, dealing 1d6 electric damage per caster level, but granting them 1 spell point per 2 caster levels. This lasts until the caster is struck once, or for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 16 \\n The effect is modified by a metamagic feat of the caster's choosing, though they spend 1 additional spell point in the effect in addition to the extra cost of the metamagic feat. The caster may only select metamagic feats they do not possess. \\n \\n \\n 17 \\n The caster's target is stunned for 1 round. Fortitude negates. \\n \\n \\n 18 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 19 \\n The caster is fatigued. If they were already fatigued, they are exhausted. \\n \\n \\n 20 \\n Until the end of the caster's next turn, all spell point costs the caster must pay are waived. \\n \\n \\n 21 \\n The next spell cast within close range of the caster automatically targets the caster, regardless of its maximum range or intended target. This lasts for 1 hour, or until a spell is redirected to the caster. \\n \\n \\n 22 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 23 \\n The caster becomes blind, but gains 60 feet blindsight that can only be used to see creatures that can store spell points, as well as any magical effects, terrain or items. This lasts for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 24 \\n Mana bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round, there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with a 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid mana, granting any creature that walks into it 1 spell point, but bestowing a -2 penalty to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 25 \\n Suffer a -2 penalty to your caster level for 1 day, or until another creature grants a spell point to you, whether temporary or not. \\n \\n \\n 26 \\n Your mana imprints to the floor. A permanent sigil spreading around a 15-foot radius around you is engraved into the floor. Any casters utilizing sphere effects on top of this sigil gain a +2 bonus to their caster level. \\n \\n \\n 27 \\n The effect is fully paid by tomorrow's energy. The sphere effect costs no spell points to cast, but the next time the spellcaster gains spell points, they subtract the amount of spell points they would have spent. \\n \\n \\n 28 \\n You strain your body, using your vitality by mistake. Instead of paying the spell point cost for this sphere effect, you instead take 1 Constitution drain for each spell point you would have spent (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 29 \\n Your magic takes a life of its own - and it does not appreciate your use. The spell effect gains life, as the Bestow Magic Life advanced talent (see the  Enhancement  sphere) and is not cast normally, instead remaining for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. It begins with an attitude initially hostile against you, and will utilize its powers to inhibit the caster for as long as it lives (including using its ability to cast sphere effects on the caster, or to grant spell points to enemies). As long as this creature lives, you cannot make use of the Mana sphere. \\n \\n \\n 30 \\n You confuse yourself, temporarily forgetting how to use your magic. You suffer from the Mark Of Incompetency talent, using your level as its caster level. Randomly determine the drawbacks you gain. \\n \\n \\n 31 \\n Mana bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round, there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with a 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid mana, granting any creature that walks into it 1 spell point, but bestowing a -2 penalty to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n The caster's body becomes transparent for 24 hours, granting them a +5 bonus on Stealth checks as long as they do not wear any clothing and do not hold or carry any items (including backpacks). \\n \\n \\n 33 \\n You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level for 1 hour. You may not lower this spell resistance. \\n \\n \\n 34 \\n For 1 minute, all magic items within long range of the caster shed light as a torch. \\n \\n \\n 35 \\n The casting time increases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 36 \\n Antimagic bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid antimagic, removing 1 spell point from any creature that walks into it (or applying a -1 penalty to a random mental ability score if they do not have spell points), but granting them a +2 bonus to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 37 \\n For 1 minute, all magic items within long range of the caster shed light as a torch. \\n \\n \\n 38 \\n All spellcasters within medium range immediately shed light as a torch, and special orbs revolve around them exposing the exact spheres they know, or magical schools they know spells of. \\n \\n \\n 39 \\n The caster drains a single spell point from any other creature that has spell points within close range. Creatures may attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect. Drained spell points are removed from the drained creature, and granted to the caster as temporary spell points that remain for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 40 \\n A zone of antimagic is created, stretching out in a 10-foot radius from the square the caster is in. The zone nullifies the spell that triggered it, and remains for 1 day per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 41 \\n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n An explosion of mana invigorates everyone. You and all allies within medium range gain 3 temporary spell points that last for 1 hour. Spells cast with these temporary spell points gain a +4 to their caster level to the effect. \\n \\n \\n 43 \\n The caster becomes truly enlightened. They lose half of their maximum spell points, but increases their caster level by 4, and they gain knowledge of one additional talent in each base sphere they possess. This lasts for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 44 \\n The caster suffers 2 ability drain to their casting ability modifier, even if they would normally be immune to ability drain. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n Magic abandons their host. All spellcasters within close range are no longer able to utilize their spellcasting, and for each spellcaster, a random other creature within range gains all of their spellcasting capabilities. This only includes spell points, base caster levels and magic skill bonuses and defense, and not class features. This effect remains for 2 rounds, where the spellcasting capabilities return to their host (not including any spent spell points). \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n The next sphere effect the caster utilizes, they may add a bonus to that sphere effect up to their caster level. The next two sphere effects they cast that costs a spell point has their caster level reduced by the amount the caster chose to increase their first cast by. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n The effect becomes ultrapowered. Increase the caster level of the effect by 10, but increase the spell point cost by 5. If the caster does not have enough spell points to cast the effect, they are exhausted, but the spell effect is still cast. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n You gain 60 feet scent, but can smell magic instead, allowing you to spend a standard action identifying a single creature or object to learn information about magical effects on that creature or object, as the base Divination ability. The use of magic doubles the range of your scent, and dead magic zones reduce it by half. This lasts for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n The casting time increases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n Any manabonds the caster has active immediately become physical, as if casted with the Hardened Bond talent. This remains until the manabond otherwise expires normally. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n For 1 hour, all attempts to utilize a sphere effect within medium range causes a swirling, rainbow colored orb to float around the caster. \\n \\n \\n 54 \\n Your magic blasts away foreign energies. In addition to its normal effects, you may make a free Counterspell attempt (as if you possessed the Counterspell feat) against any effects of your choice that your target has active upon them, and may exclude any effects you know of from this attempt. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n You channel yourself too much into your magic; you become a creature of magic, gaining spell immunity to all spheres except the Mana sphere, but creatures can target you with antimagic effects. If you enter an antimagic field, are targeted by an antimagic effect (such as Counterspell), or otherwise enter a zone of dead magic, you must succeed at a Fortitude save each round or be slain. This lasts for 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n An errant manabond is created. You create a Funnel manabond between yourself and an enemy within close range, if any. That creature is considered the creator of this manabond, and may drain your spell points if they continue to concentrate on it. Use your caster level for the caster level of this manabond. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n A magical sigil engraves on the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any beneficial magical effect cast on a target within this sigil is also cloned and cast upon every other creature standing on the sigil. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of their choice from any sphere they qualify for for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, they are instead dazed until the end of their next turn. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n All creatures you have a manabond with are electrocuted by a sudden wave of mana. Deal 1d4 untyped damage for every odd level you have to yourself and any creature you have a manabond with. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n A hostile sigil engraves into the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any expenditure of spell points within this area causes the creature spending spell points to suffer 1d8 nonlethal damage for each spell point spent. This damage increases by 1 die at 3rd caster level and every 3 levels thereafter. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n Any temporary spell points that any creature possesses within close range suddenly burst in a chaotic puff of energy, dealing 1d8 untyped damage per temporary spell point lost to the creatures that had them. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n You lose your sense of targeting. For 1 round per caster level, every time you utilize a targeted sphere effect, you must randomly decide the target between any creatures within valid range. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n (Combat) Caster is stunned for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n If the effect has a duration longer than instantaneous, it instead only remains for 1 round, but the caster level of the effect is increased by 10. If it is instantaneous, reroll this result. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n All manabonds in close range are immediately subject to a dispel attempt with a result of 11 + the caster's caster level. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n A catastrophic reaction occurs. All creatures within medium range must succeed at a Fortitude save or lose spell points equal to their Hit Dice. The caster loses all of their spell points on a failed save. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n The effect's spell point cost is reduced to 0. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n The ultimate catastrophic decay of internal magic occurs. For each base sphere the caster knows, they must roll a wild magic event on the respective sphere's table, in addition to rolling once on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n The caster's target is stunned for 1 round. Fortitude negates. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n The caster's mana separates from the caster, forming a perfect transparent blue version of themselves that moves with them but is displaced 1 foot to the left. This remains for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls are ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n Magical energies flow away from you easily. The next beneficial spell that is cast upon you is instead granted to a random enemy within close range. The caster is not aware of this effect, and the benefiting creature may choose to not activate this ability if the effect does not satisfy them, instead waiting for a different one to apply it to. This lasts for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level for 1 hour. You may not lower this spell resistance. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n 1d6 random simple weapons suddenly materialize at the caster's feet, though such weapons are made of pure mana and are worthless. They remain permanently. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 83 \\n The effect fails, the action is lost, and spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 84 \\n The caster is exhausted. If they were already exhausted, they fall asleep. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 87 \\n If the effect is instantaneous, the caster level is reduced to 1, but the effect applies again at the start of the target's turn for a number of rounds equal to the caster's casting ability modifier. If the effect is not instantaneous, reroll this result. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n Wild energies infuse your magic. For 1 round per caster level, none of your effects may be negated by counterspells, antimagic fields or similar sources of antimagic. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n For 1 hour, every time you spend a spell point, you suffer untyped damage equal to the caster level of the effect for each spell point spent. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n The caster's hair is recolored to a vibrant blue color permanently. This can be dispelled normally. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n Your magic infuses itself into your target. If you were casting a sphere effect on an ally or willing creature, you reduce their spell resistance by an amount equal to your casting ability modifier (or apply a penalty all saving throws they attempt against magic effects by the same amount). If you were casting on an enemy, you instead increase their spell resistance (or grant them a bonus on such effects). This lasts for 2 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 93 \\n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n Your magic evaporates, with it leaving a leaking hole of mana within you. The spell fails and all spell points are lost, and you lose 1 spell point at the start of each turn until you spend a full-round action restabilizing your magic by spending 1 spell point. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n For 1 minute, each time the caster attempts to utilize a magic talent that is not in the Mana sphere, they are targeted by the base Spellburn talent. Use the caster's caster level and magic skill bonus to determine the effects of this talent. \\n \\n \\n 96 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster, including the caster, display obvious signs of how many spell points they have remaining, as detailed under the Unstable Storage general drawback. \\n \\n \\n 97 \\n The caster suffers from the Vulnerable Caster drawback for 1 day, gaining no benefits for it. \\n \\n \\n 98 \\n Magic becomes a beacon. All spellcasters that utilize a magic effect within medium range suffer a -1 penalty to their armor class for each magic effect they cast for the duration of this effect, and the penalty stacks with itself. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 99 \\n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \\n \\n \\n 100 \\n The caster suffers 1d6 ability damage to their casting ability, even if they would normally be immune to ability damage.\"\n",

The zone nullifies the spell that triggered it, and remains for 1 day per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 41 \\n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n An explosion of mana invigorates everyone. You and all allies within medium range gain 3 temporary spell points that last for 1 hour. Spells cast with these temporary spell points gain a +4 to their caster level to the effect. \\n \\n \\n 43 \\n The caster becomes truly enlightened. They lose half of their maximum spell points, but increases their caster level by 4, and they gain knowledge of one additional talent in each base sphere they possess. This lasts for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 44 \\n The caster suffers 2 ability drain to their casting ability modifier, even if they would normally be immune to ability drain. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n Magic abandons their host. All spellcasters within close range are no longer able to utilize their spellcasting, and for each spellcaster, a random other creature within range gains all of their spellcasting capabilities. This only includes spell points, base caster levels and magic skill bonuses and defense, and not class features. This effect remains for 2 rounds, where the spellcasting capabilities return to their host (not including any spent spell points). \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n The next sphere effect the caster utilizes, they may add a bonus to that sphere effect up to their caster level. The next two sphere effects they cast that costs a spell point has their caster level reduced by the amount the caster chose to increase their first cast by. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n The effect becomes ultrapowered. Increase the caster level of the effect by 10, but increase the spell point cost by 5. If the caster does not have enough spell points to cast the effect, they are exhausted, but the spell effect is still cast. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n You gain 60 feet scent, but can smell magic instead, allowing you to spend a standard action identifying a single creature or object to learn information about magical effects on that creature or object, as the base Divination ability. The use of magic doubles the range of your scent, and dead magic zones reduce it by half. This lasts for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n The casting time increases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n Any manabonds the caster has active immediately become physical, as if casted with the Hardened Bond talent. This remains until the manabond otherwise expires normally. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n For 1 hour, all attempts to utilize a sphere effect within medium range causes a swirling, rainbow colored orb to float around the caster. \\n \\n \\n 54 \\n Your magic blasts away foreign energies. In addition to its normal effects, you may make a free Counterspell attempt (as if you possessed the Counterspell feat) against any effects of your choice that your target has active upon them, and may exclude any effects you know of from this attempt. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n You channel yourself too much into your magic; you become a creature of magic, gaining spell immunity to all spheres except the Mana sphere, but creatures can target you with antimagic effects. If you enter an antimagic field, are targeted by an antimagic effect (such as Counterspell), or otherwise enter a zone of dead magic, you must succeed at a Fortitude save each round or be slain. This lasts for 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n An errant manabond is created. You create a Funnel manabond between yourself and an enemy within close range, if any. That creature is considered the creator of this manabond, and may drain your spell points if they continue to concentrate on it. Use your caster level for the caster level of this manabond. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n A magical sigil engraves on the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any beneficial magical effect cast on a target within this sigil is also cloned and cast upon every other creature standing on the sigil. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of their choice from any sphere they qualify for for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, they are instead dazed until the end of their next turn. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n All creatures you have a manabond with are electrocuted by a sudden wave of mana. Deal 1d4 untyped damage for every odd level you have to yourself and any creature you have a manabond with. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n A hostile sigil engraves into the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any expenditure of spell points within this area causes the creature spending spell points to suffer 1d8 nonlethal damage for each spell point spent. This damage increases by 1 die at 3rd caster level and every 3 levels thereafter. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n Any temporary spell points that any creature possesses within close range suddenly burst in a chaotic puff of energy, dealing 1d8 untyped damage per temporary spell point lost to the creatures that had them. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n You lose your sense of targeting. For 1 round per caster level, every time you utilize a targeted sphere effect, you must randomly decide the target between any creatures within valid range. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n (Combat) Caster is stunned for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n If the effect has a duration longer than instantaneous, it instead only remains for 1 round, but the caster level of the effect is increased by 10. If it is instantaneous, reroll this result. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n All manabonds in close range are immediately subject to a dispel attempt with a result of 11 + the caster's caster level. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n A catastrophic reaction occurs. All creatures within medium range must succeed at a Fortitude save or lose spell points equal to their Hit Dice. The caster loses all of their spell points on a failed save. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n The effect's spell point cost is reduced to 0. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n The ultimate catastrophic decay of internal magic occurs. For each base sphere the caster knows, they must roll a wild magic event on the respective sphere's table, in addition to rolling once on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n The caster's target is stunned for 1 round. Fortitude negates. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n The caster's mana separates from the caster, forming a perfect transparent blue version of themselves that moves with them but is displaced 1 foot to the left. This remains for 24 hours. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls are ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n Magical energies flow away from you easily. The next beneficial spell that is cast upon you is instead granted to a random enemy within close range. The caster is not aware of this effect, and the benefiting creature may choose to not activate this ability if the effect does not satisfy them, instead waiting for a different one to apply it to. This lasts for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level for 1 hour. You may not lower this spell resistance. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n 1d6 random simple weapons suddenly materialize at the caster's feet, though such weapons are made of pure mana and are worthless. They remain permanently. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 83 \\n The effect fails, the action is lost, and spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 84 \\n The caster is exhausted. If they were already exhausted, they fall asleep. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 87 \\n If the effect is instantaneous, the caster level is reduced to 1, but the effect applies again at the start of the target's turn for a number of rounds equal to the caster's casting ability modifier. If the effect is not instantaneous, reroll this result. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n Wild energies infuse your magic. For 1 round per caster level, none of your effects may be negated by counterspells, antimagic fields or similar sources of antimagic. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n For 1 hour, every time you spend a spell point, you suffer untyped damage equal to the caster level of the effect for each spell point spent. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n The caster's hair is recolored to a vibrant blue color permanently. This can be dispelled normally. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n Your magic infuses itself into your target. If you were casting a sphere effect on an ally or willing creature, you reduce their spell resistance by an amount equal to your casting ability modifier (or apply a penalty all saving throws they attempt against magic effects by the same amount). If you were casting on an enemy, you instead increase their spell resistance (or grant them a bonus on such effects). This lasts for 2 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 92 \\n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \\n \\n \\n 93 \\n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n Your magic evaporates, with it leaving a leaking hole of mana within you. The spell fails and all spell points are lost, and you lose 1 spell point at the start of each turn until you spend a full-round action restabilizing your magic by spending 1 spell point. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n For 1 minute, each time the caster attempts to utilize a magic talent that is not in the Mana sphere, they are targeted by the base Spellburn talent. Use the caster's caster level and magic skill bonus to determine the effects of this talent. \\n \\n \\n 96 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster, including the caster, display obvious signs of how many spell points they have remaining, as detailed under the Unstable Storage general drawback. \\n \\n \\n 97 \\n The caster suffers from the Vulnerable Caster drawback for 1 day, gaining no benefits for it. \\n \\n \\n 98 \\n Magic becomes a beacon. All spellcasters that utilize a magic effect within medium range suffer a -1 penalty to their armor class for each magic effect they cast for the duration of this effect, and the penalty stacks with itself. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 99 \\n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \\n \\n \\n 100 \\n The caster suffers 1d6 ability damage to their casting ability, even if they would normally be immune to ability damage.\"\n",

Finally, you may also prevent the usage of any magical ability that requires gestures or somatic components.

As part of the casting, you may make a magic skill check or Bluff check opposed by the target's Sense Motive check (using modifiers as listed for the Bluff skill) to see how firmly the target adheres to this new information; as with a Bluff check, they may not believe this rumor even if they believe that they heard it or read it somewhere. Evidence that conflicts with the implanted memory allows a new Will save to realize that the information is faulty, though failure on a new Will save doesn't mean that the target is compelled to believe the old information (instead believing that they had learned some faulty information). In addition, the Life sphere's Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, any effect that removes the confused condition, or the Amnesia talent's lesser, greater, or powerful charms may be used to either remove false implanted information, or to make the target realize that the information is faulty. Greater Charm:  As the lesser version of the talent, but the target's new memory can relate to things within their own experience or of their own devisement (such as details about friends' lives or current news discussed at a tavern the night before). The new memories will take precedence over the old if they contradict, but the old memories will still remain (for example, a guard may have the memory of a different combination for a combination lock, password for a door, or route through a maze, but nothing stops them from recalling the true information when the implanted memories prove false.) Encountering evidence that contradicts the new memory allows a new Will save to realize that the new memories are false. In addition, the Life sphere's Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, or the Amnesia talent's greater or powerful charms may be used to either remove false implanted information, or to make the target realize that the information is faulty. Powerful Charm:  As the greater version of the talent, though you may now craft entirely new memories of events that the target has personally witnessed (Will negates). These memories are indistinguishable from actual memories, and appear to fit the flow of the continuity of their memories, but do not otherwise remove or alter the previous memories. A contradictory memory offers a +4 bonus to both the Will save to resist the charm and the Sense Motive check to resist believing the new memory. Similarly, memories of creatures doing something that they would not normally do or doing things against their nature give a further +2 or +4 bonus to these checks, respectively. A target's false memories may only be removed or proven false through the Life sphere's Break Enchantment effect if the caster also possesses the Restore Mind talent, or through the wish or miracle spells.

      "            \"benefits\": \"You imbue a creature or object with a field of refracting cogitative energy that makes it difficult to focus on what or where the field masks. Lesser Cloud:  The creature or object becomes difficult to locate intentionally and almost impossible to stumble across accidentally. Disguise checks to recognize a creature and Perception checks required to locate such an object or person have their DCs increased by 1 + 1 for every 2 caster levels, and any creature with this ability placed upon them may immediately attempt to hide even if observed or without cover or concealment. Loud noises, sudden actions, or other typically noticeable events allow creatures near such an effect to make a Perception check (still modified by the lesser charm's boost to DCs) to notice the creature. This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. If the creature makes an attack against another creature, the effect automatically ends. Greater Cloud:  In addition to the lesser effects of Dispersion, a magic skill check may be rolled at the time of casting, prompting a Will save from anyone in the cloud's line of sight. If the check result is higher than any given observer's Will save, then when the target is successfully hidden from direct observation the observer will forget about their active presence in the environment. If the observer is reminded about the target by being told of its presence or directly observing it, the observer gains another Will save to recall the target and the target's significance to the current situation. (Successfully hiding again may, however, cause the observer to forget the target again.) Powerful Cloud:  In addition to the lesser and greater effects of Dispersion, the warded area, object, or creature becomes supernaturally difficult to observe. Even if a creature is aware of the target, they must pass a Will save every round to actively engage with the target, such as through conversation, attacking, searching, or medical treatment. Skill checks that are carried out over the course of minutes, hours, or days (or similar unit of time) instead of rounds impose a Will save for every unit of time involved instead of every round due to the increased intentional focus of the people performing such tasks (up to the duration of the Dispersion effect).\"\n",

If the effect is used to invite creatures, they feel elated and pleased to be in the area of the effect, or desire to touch or possess the affected item. They have an overpowering desire to stay in the area or remain in contact with the item. If the effect is used to repel creatures, they feel an urge to leave the area or avoid the object in question. The creatures will actively shun the area and not willingly return to it while the talent's effect is active. If a save to resist the invitation effect is successful, the creature is unaffected, but they must reattempt the save after 1d6 x 10 minutes if they are still within range and the effect is still continuing. Similarly, if the save to resist the repulsion effect is successful, the creature may remain in the area or in contact with the object, but will feel uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points (to a minimum of 1) until they leave the area of the effect. Lesser Cloud:  The lure effect can invite or repel creatures of up to 1/2 your caster level in HD (Will negates). The effect applies to any creature who comes within close range of the effect. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level. Greater Cloud:  As the lesser cloud, except it can affect creatures of up to your caster level in HD, applies to any creature who comes within medium range of the effect, and lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level.

In addition, failure means that the target is treated as one stage friendlier to you for the purposes of shifting his or her attitude by one step (for instance, changing the attitude of a creature from unfriendly to indifferent normally requires a DC equal to 20 + the creature's Charisma modifier, but would now only require a DC equal to 15 + the creature's Charisma modifier). These effects last a number of hours equal to your casting ability modifier, but the normal rules for the frequency with which a creature may be influenced by Bluff or Diplomacy are still in effect. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.\"\n",

The cosmetic style of your dreamspace is only partially under your control, reflecting your current dreams, state of your mind, and conscious desires. When you use an action to adjust the style it will always reflect your intended changes, but you do not have fine control over its appearance and your unconscious mind may be reflected in its subtler elements. You can choose to have it appear as a castle, but not a specific castle or place you have seen, and if you are worried it may appear to be under siege or shrouded in shadow. You interact with the dreamspace using a copy of your body and all you wear, leaving behind your physical body in the real world. You may also choose to bring up to a heavy load of unattended, inanimate objects within touch range into your dreamspace with you, causing them to disappear when you fall asleep, and may choose to bring them back in a similar manner when you wake. Your dreamspace and any items left within it persist even while you are not in it, though they enter stasis until you return. Because the dreamspace is not a true physical location, you cannot take any actions that would cause you to leave the dreamspace other than waking up, or that would affect your body or the real world. In addition, the dreamspace cannot be entered using normal teleportation or planeshifting effects. At the GM's discretion, effects allowing travel to normal dreams can enter the dreamspace, and it may count as a dreamscape for certain effects.

A mental aura functions as a cloud attached to a creature (with the normal radius of 10 feet in radius + an extra 5 feet per caster level) except that it becomes inactive if that creature is knocked unconscious and is dispelled if they are killed. Mental auras continue to function if they go beyond the range of their creator. The mental aura has a duration of concentration or 1 minute per caster level if you spend an additional spell point. Any creature that enters or starts its turn in a mental aura is affected by a single lesser charm that you can create (chosen at the time you create the aura). At your discretion, you may choose to omit allies or enemies from the effects of the mental aura. Creatures are allowed saving throws as normal to negate the effects of these charms. For effects that are dependent upon input or orders by the caster (such as Suggestion or Command), this input is decided when the mental aura is created. A creature that has been affected by a mental aura cannot be affected by the same aura again (or the charm it replicated) for 24 hours.

An unwilling creature can have a mental aura attached to them as a touch attack and they may attempt a Will save to negate the effect initially.

This is resolved after the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 94 \\n The target perceives all creatures as babies (or nearest equivalent) for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 95 \\n The target is not affected but gains a gaze attack for 1d6 rounds. Any creature affected by the gaze attack is affected by the triggering effect until the target loses the gaze attack.

This result is resolved prior to the attack being resolved. \\n \\n \\n 99 \\n The caster grows tired and must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1 round as the greater charm option of the Sleep talent. On a successful save the caster is staggered for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 100 \\n All creatures that the caster encounters in the next hour that are not immune to mind-affecting effects have their dispositions toward the caster increased by 1 step for 1 day. About Dreamscapes Some of the material on this site will reference dreamscapes, subrealities that exist within the minds of most sentient beings, often whether they are aware that they exist or not. No one knows exactly how or why dreamscapes first came to be, but they seem to exist as interconnected islands of psychic energy separated by an unknown sea of consciousness that has, so far, defied most attempts at classification by scholars of the arcane. The rules for dreamscapes closely resemble the rules for mindscapes as found in Paizo's Occult Adventures, though most fall into the category of overt immersive mindscapes. Dreamscapes similarly assume that they are located not on the Astral plane, but rather on the plane of whoever creates them unless physical travel to one's own dreamscape occurs. These demiplanes may be located through scrying or similar divination effects just as if scrying on the dreamer who causes the dreamscape to exist. For the most part, the material that references dreamscapes will work just as well for the mindscape, but varying outside of the overt immersive category may lead to unexpected results. Dream safely! One noteworthy variation from the mindscape rules is the inclusion of thought constructs. These metaphysical structures of pure thought and dream are usually purely aesthetic, but some provide noticeable benefits (or potentially detriments) to the one who has them in their dreamscape, and they are sometimes built with the intention of protecting a dreamscape (or people within it) from certain kinds of threats, or to allow the dreamscapes to function in new ways. The small number of examples here may be added to with GM permission, either through player research or as a potential story element. The majority of thought constructs are aesthetic and offer no (or negligible) benefits, such as a cottage, windmill, small castle, tree, or even clouds that provide gentle rains. Thought constructs that provide active bonuses or significant changes impart some mental strain, and as such an individual may only have a number of these notably beneficial thought constructs equal to their highest mental ability score modifier. Thought constructs are metaphysically tangible, and have some substance that visitors to the dreamscapes can manipulate. Regular attacks or talents won't hurt them, but for those attacks specifically designed to harm thought constructs or do damage in a dreamscape, treat the \\\"typical\\\" thought construct as having hit points equal to ten times the dreamscape owner's highest mental ability score modifier. Thought constructs designated as resilient may have up to double this amount, and ones designated as fragile as little as half. A thought construct reduced to half its hit points or less becomes non-functional, and one reduced to zero hit points ceases to exist. The constructs will heal themselves over time, restoring health equal to its owner's highest mental ability score modifier every day that the creature doesn't experience extreme confusion, fear, intimidation, or other similarly stressors. Finally, the knowledge of an individual's dreamscape is a powerful thing in the wrong hands, but the complexities involved make keeping track of that knowledge baffling to some. Scrying on an individual, with the intent to discover their dreamscape, is the most common way to learn the coordinates of a dreamscape, as opposed to that which one normally determines via scrying. One's capacity for understanding the metaphysical \\\"space\\\" of a dreamscapes is limited in a manner similar to that of knowing spells (see  Spellcrafting ). Apart from the location of one's own dreamscape, which is always intuitively known, the location of other dreamscapes takes up the same mental space as a spell known via Spellcrafting. Learning a dreamscape's coordinates beyond this limit requires either forgetting a previously known set of coordinates, or copying coordinates into a spellbook as per the Craft Spellbook feat. (For most purposes, treat this as a spell with only the Mind sphere as a prerequisite. For each point of an individual's mental ability modifiers above 3, and each time an individual has the Sphere Focus or Spell Focus feats, increase the complexity of the spell by 1 (as if the theoretical spell required an additional talent)). Example:  An incanter with an Intelligence of 20 and a Wisdom of 18, plus the Sphere Focus (Mind) feat would have the coordinates of his dreamscape treated as a spell with a complexity of 5 (Mind sphere + 4 talents), meaning his coordinates would take up 5 pages and require 5 hours to copy.\"\n",

Lesser Charm:  You may plant a suggestion in a target's mind, which they obey as if the thought had been their own (Will negates). The suggested course of activity must be limited to a sentence or two and must be a very simple request. The creature performs the suggested action until it finishes, or for 1 hour per caster level, whichever comes first. If you choose, you can instead specify conditions the creature should look for, (i.e., \\\"you should search the next person who enters this room, looking for weapons.\\\") If the condition is not met before this duration expires, the activity is not performed. Greater Charm:  This is the same as the Suggestion lesser charm, but may be up to a basic request. Very simple requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty. The target cannot be asked to do anything it would not normally do. Powerful Charm:  This is the same as the Suggestion lesser charm, but the creature obeys any course of action given, so long as the suggestion is not obviously fatal or against the target's nature. Basic requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty, while very simple requests cause the save to be made with a -4 penalty. Some mind talents are designated (charm) talents. These talents grant you additional charms you may place on targets. Cloud Talents marked with the (cloud) tag allow the caster to create clouds of mental energy that emanate from an area, object, or creature. Creatures are not affected by a cloud unless they enter its area, or otherwise interact with the cloud in a fashion designated by the talent. You may imbue an area, object, or creature at close range with a cloud. An imbued item may be no larger than 5 cubic ft. per caster level in size. A creature may be up to the caster's size + 1 size category for every 5 caster levels. It is possible to imbue a portion of an item or creature (a single head of a massive, two-headed dragon or a single segment of a lengthy carpet with blood smeared over it, for instance) but hiding a portion of an item or creature won't prevent the whole of it from being noticed. Unless otherwise specified, a cloud's radius extends from an item or creature as if the creature was the center of an imbued area measured as a radius. An imbued area may either be 10 ft. in radius + an extra 5 ft. per caster level, or a 10-ft. wide area that extends for a length of 10 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level (such as would be appropriate to fill a 10 ft. wide hallway). Establishing a cloud requires a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. As with charms, most clouds have three strengths; lesser, greater, and powerful. Spell point expenditures remain the same for the three strengths, and you may only affect a creature with a cloud if you could also affect it with a charm. Similarly, the Powerful Charm talent is required to use the powerful versions of clouds and you may only imbue the same item, creature, or area with a lesser cloud once per day. With the exception of Group Charm, cloud talents are affected by talents that affect charms. Cognition [Apoc] Some talents are marked (cognition). These talents grant you additional mental powers, increasing your ability to analyze and think. All (cognition) talents are personal range, benefiting only the person that uses them.

Gust Of Wind:  Concentration, requires air. You may create a line-shaped gust of wind emanating out from you out to the edge of your geomancing range, affecting all creatures and objects within that line. The severity level of the wind is 3 + 1 per 5 caster levels (see the Wind category of the Weather sphere for more information). If maintaining Gust Of Wind via concentration, you may spend a spell point as a free action to increase the severity level of its wind by 1 for that round. Walls and other barriers block this wind. Author's Note:  If Gust Of Wind is used in an area of existing wind severity level 3 or greater, the geomancing ability may have different effects depending upon what direction your line-shaped gust is blowing versus the existing weather.

You may affect a normal, non-magical fire, increasing or decreasing its size by one category, plus one per 5 caster levels. This is only a temporary change; once the effect ends, the fire returns to its normal size. Reducing a fire smaller than Fine extinguishes it, in which case it does not return to normal size after the effect ends. The fire consumes fuel and deals damage as appropriate for its new size, according to Table: Maximum Fire Size. Creatures caught in the fire's area are allowed a Reflex save for half damage. The minimum caster level required to affect a fire is also given in the chart. If two casters are affecting the same fire in the same direction (increasing or decreasing) only the strongest change occurs. If two casters attempt to Affect Fire in opposite directions (one making it bigger, one making it smaller), the second caster must succeed at a magic skill check. On a success, their ability functions normally, overlapping the first caster's effect. The fire counts as its altered size for determining if the second caster can affect it. Note:  If multiple fires overlap, or if a Large or larger creature is affected by multiple smaller fires within its area at once, these fires combine to determine the effective size of the fire when determining damage (2 Small fires make 1 Medium fire, 2 Medium fires make 1 Large fire, etc.). If a creature has caught on fire, treat that fire as being Tiny-sized for the purpose of this effect. When you affect a fire on a creature, you also raise or lower the Reflex save DC to put the fire out by 1/2 your caster level (minimum 0).

If a target is within the area of the created fire, they suffer damage as normal for that fire's size and catch fire. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates catching fire. Manipulate Lava:  Instantaneous or concentration, requires lava. You may manipulate lava. This is exactly the same as the Freeze and Vortex powers from the (water) package, except you must spend an additional spell point for each ability, and you must target lava.

      "            \"benefits\": \"Magnetize:  Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard action, you may cause a creature or object within your geomancing range consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to fly towards a creature or object of your choice within your geomancing range. This can only be used on unattended objects, attended objects from willing creatures, or willing creatures consisting mostly of metal. You may choose to throw the item harmlessly (in which case it can either be caught by the target or else lands in an adjacent square), or you may use this as a ranged attack action. This counts as a ranged attack, except you must use your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity. If successful, you deal either the object's 'ore damage', or if it is a weapon, the weapon's damage (arrows and bolts with metal tips count as daggers for this purpose, dealing 1d4 damage). Despite the name of this ability, the target object or creature need not be made of metal. Recover Ore:  Instantaneous, requires dirt or sand. As a standard action, you may create a piece of metal ore by pulling and combining particles of metal from the ground. You must spend a spell point to use this ability, and must have a large enough piece of earth (sand or dirt) to pull the ore from. This piece of ore can be brass, bronze, copper, or tin, and the size of the ore recovered depends both on your caster level and the square footage of earth you pull from. The piece of ore you recover is formed on the ground in an unoccupied space within range and can be of any basic shape (a ball, a rod, a sheet, even a chair) but cannot be anything complex or with moving parts. You may also pull multiple pieces of ore placed in different adjacent squares, so long as their combined size does not exceed your maximum, and each piece of recovered ore must be of the same type (such as copper or tin). For these purposes, 2 Fine-sized pieces of ore equals 1 Diminutive-sized piece, etc. While this effect is instantaneous and thus cannot be dispelled, ore breaks back into particles after 1 hour per caster level. If a piece of ore is used as a weapon, it counts as an improvised weapon, dealing either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen at the time of Recovery. The damage such a weapon deals is listed as 'ore damage' in the chart below. As always, improvised weapons bestow a -4 penalty to attack rolls.

The Value of Recovered Ore:  Ore recovered through the (metal) package from the Nature sphere is of poor quality and degrades quickly, making it impossible to simply create and sell. However, players who possess a metal-based Craft or Profession skill such as Craft (weapons) or Profession (blacksmith) can heat and purify this ore to make it workable. This allows such a character to attempt Craft or Profession checks to earn a wage even without the presence of a market or workshop to work in. Rather than earning money, the check instead creates an amount of raw materials equal to that day or week's wage, which may be sold later or used as raw materials for any metal-based crafting. Reforge:  Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to cause an unattended object (or object that you are holding) consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to be reshaped into a different object of the same size. For example, you could reshape a longsword into a mace. You may not reshape metal objects into forms with complex moving parts. If targeting a magical item, the effect is not instantaneous, but lasts for only 1 minute before the object reverts to its original form. If reshaping a magical item would make it no longer qualify for specific enhancements, those enhancements are suppressed for the effect's duration. Reforge does not function on artifacts.\"\n",

You cause plants to grow rapidly, wrapping themselves around everything in a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. Creatures within this area must succeed at a Reflex save or gain the entangled condition and become unable to move. Creatures that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of each turn you maintain the effect. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can break free as a move action, if they succeed at a Strength or Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the effect's Reflex save DC. This area is also considered difficult terrain for the duration of the effect. If the area contained plants with thorns, all creatures suffer 1 point of piercing damage each round they are within this area. Harvest:  Instantaneous, requires fruit trees, berry bushes, or food crops. You may spend a spell point to cause plants to sprout food spontaneously. You may affect up to 1 plant per caster level within range. Each plant produces enough food to provide 3 Medium-sized creatures or 1 horse with food for a day. Pummel:  Concentration, requires a tree. You cause a tree branch to come alive and attack a foe you designate. The tree cannot move, but it makes one slam attack each round against the designated target until you spend a move action to designate another target or until the target dies or moves out of range. Slam attacks from the pummel deal damage as if it were a primary attack, may be enhanced as a natural weapon as if the tree branch were a creature, and are not subject to spell resistance. You cannot designate a target you cannot perceive. The branch has a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level, and a to-hit modifier equal to your caster level + its Strength modifier + its size modifier. You may animate a Medium branch at 1st caster level, and your maximum size increases by 1 category per 5 caster levels. An entire tree can count as a branch, provided the tree is not larger than your maximum Pummel size. In place of animating a branch of Large-size or larger, you may animate a pair of branches that are two sizes or smaller on the same tree. You can only do this once per branch that you otherwise could animate with pummel. For example, at CL 20, when targeting a Colossal tree, they can choose to animate: 1 Colossal-sized branch, or 2 Huge-sized branches, or 2 Large-sized branches, or 2 Medium-sized branches, etc. Branches are still objects, and as such always fail saving throws, can gain the broken condition (suffering a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls), and are destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Note:  There are very few worlds, even among fantasy, where trees exist that are Colossal+ or larger. However, a caster of particularly high caster level may still subdivide larger branches into smaller branches using Table: Number of Branches Per Size Category of Tree as a guide. For example, a Colossal++ tree would have 1d4 (avg 3) Colossal-sized branches, 3d4 (avg 8) Huge-sized branches, and 9d4 (avg 23) Large-sized branches. Regardless of your caster level, or the size of the tree, you cannot animate a branch that is larger than Colossal-sized. Note:  Primary natural attacks usually get a 1.5x Strength multiplier for their damage. See the rules on natural attacks in the CRB for more information on this.

You may treat a creature susceptible to bleed damage that is taking bleed damage or below half its maximum hit points as being wet for any ability that requires it. You may treat a creature susceptible to bleed damage of at least Large size (count two Medium creatures as a Large creature, two Small creatures as a Medium creature, etc.) that is suffering bleed damage or below half its maximum hit points as a sufficient volume to use the Fog ability. Fog:  Concentration, requires rain, mist, or at least 5 cubic feet of water. You call up a rolling fog, cutting off people's vision within a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). The ability does not function underwater. If using a body of water, the fog must be at least partially over the water itself. If you spend a spell point to maintain this effect without concentration, a moderate wind (11+ mph) will disperse it within 4 rounds. In the presence of a strong wind (21+ mph), you cannot use this ability. Freeze:  Instantaneous, requires water. You may spend a spell point to flash freeze water, turning it into ice. You may freeze a 1 inch thick, 5-foot-by-5-foot square of water per caster level. Alternatively, you may cover a wet Medium-sized creature with 1 inch of ice per caster level. You may increase the size of the frozen area or size/number of the frozen creatures, but divide the ice's thickness by the equivalent number of Medium-sized creatures. Creatures smaller than Medium count as Medium-sized creatures for this effect, with the exception of multiple creatures occupying the same space. Add the sizes of multiple creatures occupying the same space together when determining their size for this purpose. For swarms, count each 5-foot square as being 2 Medium-sized creatures occupying the same space. You may affect both squares and creatures, but all affected targets and spaces must be contiguous and must have the same thickness of ice. Creatures are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being frozen. On a failure, they are encased and cannot move, and suffer 1 point of cold damage per round per inch of ice. To escape, they must succeed at a Strength check or Escape Artist check as a full-round action to escape the ice (DC 15 +1 per inch of thickness) or another creature must break the ice around the trapped creature (3 hit points per inch). While encased, a target can only take mental or verbal actions, or attempt to escape. Being encased in ice blocks line of effect, but not line of sight (the creature may still be targeted, but effects that deal damage to the target must break through the ice first before dealing damage to the target). On a successful save, the target is still entangled for 1 round. Ice melts 1 inch of thickness per minute on the average day. When freezing ice or wet ground, you may also create slick ice. A creature traversing slick ice must spend two squares of movement to first enter a space with ice, and cannot move more than half speed without a successful DC 15 Acrobatic check at the start of the movement, falling prone on a failure. Running or charging requires a DC 20 Acrobatics check, falling prone on a failure, but increasing the runner's move across the ice by 10 feet if successful by 5 or more, though the runner is considered flat-footed until the start of its next turn.).

You may create a spinning vortex in a body of liquid that sucks creatures and objects to its center. This vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, is 10 feet high + 5 feet per 5 caster levels, and is half as wide at the top as it is high. Any creature entering this area must succeed at a Reflex save or suffer bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 0). If the creature is smaller than the vortex, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or be pulled into the middle of the vortex. Creatures in the middle of the vortex suffer bludgeoning damage once per round with no save, and must succeed at a Reflex save each round or be unable to move, and on a success may only move at half their swim speed. A vortex cannot contain more creatures than would exceed its volume. You may move the vortex up to 30 feet per round as part of the action required to concentrate on it. If maintaining the effect through a method other than concentration, you may designate a simple pattern for it to move, which you may alter as a move action. Creatures in the middle of the vortex are carried along with it as it moves. Nature Talent Types Some talents are marked (air), (earth), (fire), (metal), (plant), or (water).

Additionally, you gain the following geomancing abilities: Absorbing Inhalation:  Concentration. You may, as a standard action, grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar cloud-like effect during the duration of the talent. The cloud-like effect can have no larger of a radius than 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a magic skill check to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal breathable air in its place. Gaseous creatures gain a Reflex save to avoid being inhaled. This talent can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to utilize the talent in response. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for as long as the talent remains active, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration (gaseous creatures are immediately and harmlessly exhaled should their gaseous form expire in the nearest empty space). As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60- foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, attempting saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud immediately ends the duration of this talent. If you do not exhale the cloud before this talent's duration expires, you suffer the cloud's effects, automatically fail any saving throw made to resist it, and exhaling any gaseous creatures inhaled into the nearest empty space. Feather Fall:  Concentration, requires air. You cause all falling creatures or objects within a 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels radius to fall slowly, changing the rate at which they fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet). The targets take no damage upon landing while this talent is in effect. Once applied, this effect stays with the individually affected targets until the duration expires.

Your buoyancy does not change based on what equipment you are carrying. As a standard action, you may change your buoyancy again (alongside the buoyancy of any other willing creatures affected by this spirit). Aquatic Mire (geomancing):  You may create fog effects underwater, in which case they function as they normally would in the air. Instead of wind, currents can disperse an underwater fog; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a fog in 1 round. Create Current (geomancing):  If you have the (air) package, you may use the gust of wind ability underwater, creating a current of equal speed and range to the gust of wind you could create (see the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for rules on currents).

Additionally, when you use Breeze, you may add any of the following additional effects depending on what other packages you possess. Air: Stable Winds:  Requires air. You can create incredibly powerful winds, allowing you to walk upon the air with some difficulty as long as you concentrate. You can spend a spell point to allow yourself to walk on air as if walking on solid ground, with moving upward being similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, which is at a rate equal to half your normal land speed. Wind of severity level 3 or higher can blow you away regardless of your size, with any checks required (such as a Strength or Fly check) using your casting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier used for the check. You begin to fall as normal if you stop concentrating on this effect. Earth: Stabilizing Dustveil:  Requires sand or loose dirt. You can create winds made up of fine particles of dust and sand, stabilizing the area around you. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to your CMD against bull rush, reposition, trip, and overrun combat maneuvers made against you. Additionally, you treat the first square of difficult terrain you enter every round as if it were normal terrain. Fire: Warm Breeze:  Your breeze is heated to ward against the chill. Instead of the normal bonus to saves against very hot conditions or severe heat, Breeze instead grants this bonus to saves against very cold conditions and severe cold. Additionally, when used in this way, creatures affected by your Breeze treat the severity of all cold and precipitation weather effects as one step less severe, plus one per 10 caster levels you possess. Metal: Ferrous Zephyr:  Requires metal. You can create a breeze filled with fine filaments of metal. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to your AC and to saving throws against electricity-based effects. Additionally, you ignore the penalties associated with the broken condition with any of your worn or wielded equipment (but is still considered broken regardless) as long as the Breeze is active. Plant: Fragrant Flurry:  Requires grass, vines, or weeds. Your breeze smells of pleasant meadows and flowers, and causes vines and flowers to grow where it touches. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to saving throws against the nauseated and sickened conditions and any harmful effects that rely on smell. Additionally, the DC required to track creatures affected by Breeze increases by an amount equal to the circumstance bonus granted by Breeze. Water: Cooling Breeze:  Requires rain, mist, or at least 5 cubic feet of water.

While this is its own geomancing ability, it may also be combined with another geomancing ability as part of the same action, in which case the second geomancing ability comes into effect immediately, using the created element to meet the second ability's prerequisites. You must pay any costs associated with both abilities to combine them in this manner. Create Nature counts as a geomancing ability or effect belonging to the package being used. Air: Create Air:  You create a cloud of air. This creates one 5-foot cube per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 cube) of breathable air. The created cloud of air will immediately displace other gases, liquids, and vapors in the area, but will shortly thereafter behave as normal air. For example, if this talent is used underwater, the created air cloud will form a bubble that will begin to ascend to the surface. Earth: Granulate:  You create enough loose dirt or sand to cover a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area. You may reduce the spell point cost by 1 (minimum 0 spell points) if you choose to break apart rock and stone within this area (reducing their thickness by 1 inch, +1 inch per 5 caster levels), instead of creating the dirt or sand spontaneously. Collapsing Structures \\nGenerally speaking, single castings of Create Nature (earth) on stone structures will not be enough to compromise the structural integrity of a building. Should half of the structure's load bearing columns, keystones, or walls be reduced to half thickness or less, a weakened area is created. Those who notice the weakened area (with a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) or Knowledge (engineering) check) may exacerbate the situation by destroying half of the structure's load-bearing objects, triggering a cave-in or collapse. Rules for the cave-in and collapse hazard can be found in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide. Fire:  While the (fire) package already has the power to Create Fire, you may now combine Create Fire with another geomancing ability, as outlined above. This can include using Affect Fire and Create Fire at the same time to create truly powerful fires. Unlike the uses listed above, you do not need to spend a spell point to combine Create Fire and other geomancing abilities as part of the same action. Metal:  You may now use Recover Ore in conjunction with other geomancing abilities, as outlined above, though doing so increases the cost of Recover Ore to 2 spell points instead of 1. Hemoglobin:  You may create metal ore out of a living creature's essence. Target a living corporeal creature within your geomancing range. To use hemoglobin, make a ranged touch attack against the target, inflicting 1d2 Constitution damage to the target (Fortitude save for half damage). The die size of the Constitution damage increases by 1 step for every 5 caster levels (1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). Regardless of the creature's size or bodily composition, you Recover Ore of Fine size upon successfully hitting the target. While the name of this ability suggests the target must bleed or have blood, it is not necessary; the only requirement is that the creature be corporeal and living. If the target is immune to ability damage, you still Recover Ore of Fine size. Plant: Grow Plants:  You spontaneously grow plants. This may create one tree (to a maximum size equal to that which you can control through the Pummel geomancing ability) or a field of plants within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area. This may create basic plants (corn, underbrush, ivy) and may be combined with Harvest to create edible food, but cannot create plants with inherent qualities (i.e., you cannot create rare herbs, etc.). Water: Create Water:  You create a pool of water. You create one 5-foot cube per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 cube) of clean water. Using this ability in conjunction with Vortex can create a vortex that travels on land, so long as it is always touching the ground. Using this ability in conjunction with Freeze can allow you to create walls of ice by freezing vertical spaces as you would normally do horizontal spaces. These walls cover the same area and have the same hit points as usual, but may be arranged in a contiguous wall no more than 5 feet high per inch of thickness.\"\n",

You may manipulate the earth surrounding a burrowing or buried creature or object, forcing them to be pushed or pulled 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels each round towards the surface (Fortitude negates). While affected, the target is unable to burrow or earth glide on its own, but is otherwise unimpeded. You may only target a creature or object whose location you have pinpointed (such as with a successful Perception check or with tremorsense). Unless the target has earth glide, the creature cannot be forcefully moved through stone (or lava if the target possesses fire resistance 20+ or fire immunity), but rather only sand or dirt. Each round, the target is allowed a new Fortitude save to end the effect. Sandstone:  Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point to transform dirt or sand into stone in an area within range. The size of the created rock or stone depends both on your caster level and the radius of dirt or sand you target. Alternatively, you may encase a dirt or sand covered target in 1 inch thick stone. Refer to Table: Sandstone to determine the maximum target size to be encased. For every size smaller the encased target is than the required radius of dirt or sand, either double the thickness of the stone or increase the number of encased targets. Creatures and objects are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being trapped in stone. On a failure, creatures or objects caught in the area are encased; to escape, they must succeed at an Escape Artist or Strength check (equal to your Bury geomancing DC) as a full-round action; alternatively, a creature may break free by dealing sufficient damage to the rock or stone. Stone has a hardness of 15 and 2 hit points per inch. On a successful save, affected targets are still entangled and immobilized until they escape or 1 minute per caster level, whichever comes first.

In addition to the fog, this also functions as a Vortex, except it travels over land and extends into the air, and can even leave the ground and travel in the air.

If using Freeze on creatures, this affects the spaces adjacent to where they are standing. Freeze can't create both spikes and slippery ice in the same space. Whenever a creature steps onto an affected square, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half due to its wounded feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration.

The types and forms you can create are determined by your Nature packages, as outlined below: Air: Air Geyser:  Instantaneous, requires air. You may, as a standard action, create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging a Medium-sized or smaller target within range upward into the air (Reflex negates). If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of air hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 x your caster level (or 10 x your caster level if you spend an additional spell point). If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet that the target was not hurled upward. For example, if a creature would be hurled 20 feet into the air but hits a ceiling at 10 feet, the target would take 1d6 damage. After this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as normal. The maximum size of the target increases by 1 size category every 5 caster levels. Earth: Forge Earth:  Instantaneous, requires ground. You may spend a spell point to alter the ground within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. You may raise or lower the terrain up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels, and may create variants within the affected area such as summoning a small wall or creating gradients and stair effects. You cannot both raise and lower the terrain with the same use of this ability and cannot create variants in anything smaller than 5-foot squares (i.e., you cannot create 1-foot diameter holes or create a spike of earth). Targets within this area are not damaged by falling if you lower the terrain, and climbing up the edges of lowered terrain usually requires a DC 15 Climb check. Fire: Move Fire:  Concentration. You may move a fire within your Affect Fire size up to 10 feet per caster level per round in whatever manner and direction you desire. A fire moved in this way continues to burn, even without fuel (although it may be drowned or extinguished otherwise as normal), and dies as soon as the effect ends if not moved to a new fuel source. If you have spent a spell point to make this use of Affect Fire self-sustaining, directing the fire is still a move action. When moving fire to or through a space occupied by a creature, that creature suffers the fire's damage and catches on fire (Reflex for half damage and to not catch on fire). A creature can only be affected once per round by a fire, no matter how many times the fire moves through their space. If you can Affect Fire or Create Fire, you may Move Fire as part of those geomancing effects. Metal: Pin-ball:  When using the Magnetize geomancing ability as a weapon, if the attack hits you may spend a spell point as a free action to Magnetize another creature within range and make a ranged attack at that creature. These additional attacks are not attack actions. The number of granted attacks increases by +1 per 5 caster levels, but if you miss once the pin-ball ability ends without any further attacks. You may not make ranged attacks with the pin-ball ability two or more times in a row against the same target. Plant: Shelter:  Instantaneous, requires tree or branch. You may spend a spell point to reshape a tree to create a shelter. Use the Pummel geomancing ability to determine the hit points and size of a shelter based on the tree used (the radius of the shelter is the reach of the tree or branch used). Creatures and equipment under the shelter suffer no harm from being in a hot or cold environment, and can exist comfortably in conditions between \\u201350 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (-45.5 and 60 degrees Celsius) without having to attempt Fortitude saves. In addition, the shelter provides protection against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth, however the vessel does not protect against any environmental damage such as cold or fire damage. The shelter also provides cover (+4 AC, +2 Reflex saves) to and from those inside, and hostile creatures cannot enter the shelter without first destroying the shelter. However, if the tree or branch used to create the shelter is destroyed, the effects of the shelter immediately end. Author's Note:  The Shelter geomancing ability is intended to work similarly to the Secure Shelter spell. As such, incorporeal creatures should be able enter the shelter without forcing their way in. Similarly, the shelter should not inherently restrict creatures from teleporting into the structure provided that the teleporting creature meets all other requirements, such as line of sight, etc. Water: Wave:  Instantaneous, requires water. You may create a surge in water that pushes targets in its wake. This surge may be created anywhere within range and may face any direction, but once created it travels in a straight line for a distance of 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. This area may extend out of the water and onto land to a maximum of 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. The wave created is 5 feet wide. The width may be doubled by halving the length. This may be done multiple times, but the length cannot become smaller than 5 feet. A target cannot be pushed back further than the wave's length. All creatures within the affected area are pushed as if by a bull rush combat maneuver, except it does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Use your caster level + your casting ability modifier in place of your CMB. If the target is on land and is successfully pushed by this ability, they must also succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone.

In addition, you may cause a branch to perform any of the following actions instead of making an attack. Aggravating Vegetation:  You may instruct the vegetation to focus on antagonizing its target instead of making a regular attack. The branch or tree makes an attack roll as an antagonize check against the target's Psychology DC (10 + Hit Dice + Wisdom modifier; or 10 + Sense Motive bonus, if it is higher). Unlike a normal antagonize check, you do not suffer a \\u20134 penalty on antagonize attempts made against opponents of a different creature type or that are of animal intelligence (Intelligence 1 or 2). Creatures who have been previously antagonized gain a +4 bonus to their Psychology DC. Mindless creatures are immune to the effects of antagonize. Antagonize is a mind-affecting effect. If you successfully beat the target's Psychology DC, the creature, instead of taking damage, gains the antagonized condition against the attacking vegetation. The antagonized condition remains for 1 round. The duration of this condition increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat your opponent's Psychology DC. Antagonized Condition:  The antagonized condition appears in Ultimate Charisma, published and copyrighted by Everyman's Game, LLC. An antagonized creature can only target its antagonist (the one who caused the antagonized condition) with hostile actions. A hostile action is any attack or effect that causes direct harm to an opponent in the form of damage, negative conditions, or any other effect that penalizes or hinders a creature. Furthermore, an antagonized creature does not threaten any opponents except its antagonist: it cannot make attacks of opportunity or be used to determine flanking bonuses against other opponents. A creature is no longer antagonized if its antagonist is helpless, unconscious, or cannot participate in combat. If an antagonizes creature uses an ability that targets multiple creatures, the antagonist must be chosen among these targets. If an antagonized creature uses an ability that targets an area, its antagonist must be within the ability's targeted area. On each round after the first, an antagonized creature may attempt a Sense Motive skill check as a swift action to realize the folly of its actions. This skill check is opposed by the antagonist's original antagonize skill check. If the creature succeeds on its Sense Motive skill check, the antagonized condition ends, but the creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty to the saving throw DC of its abilities and any spells it casts for 1 minute. These penalties do not apply against the antagonist. Sap Conglutination:  Instead of a regular attack, you may instruct the vegetation to excrete a rubbery resin and attempt to coat the target with it. Targets hit by the attack become coated with this sap and gain the fatigued condition until they remove it as a full-round action. If a fatigued creature becomes coated with sap a second time, they gain the exhausted condition until the sap is removed as a full-round action.\"\n",

This bonus or detriment is applied after abilities and feats such as Improved Critical or the keen weapon special ability, and cannot be doubled. If this would decrease a weapon's critical hit threat range below 1, the weapon instead has its critical hit multiplier decreased by 1 for every point it is reduced below 1 (minimum x1 crit multiplier).

Heat Metal:  If you possess the (fire) package, you may heat metal.

Any effect with a descriptor corresponding to the repressed element does not manifest within the area unless the caster succeeds at a magical skill check. Additional effects apply depending on the element repressed. Air: Vacuum Generation:  The area becomes a vacuum, preventing creatures from breathing or sound (including sonic effects) from moving through the area. Characters cannot cast with verbal components in the vacuum. Starting at caster level 5th, all creatures in the area of the created vacuum take 1d6 bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 5 caster levels thereafter.

A creature may only be affected by the damage from vacuum once per round, regardless of how many times they enter or exit the area that turn. Creatures that need air to breathe suffer from suffocation in a vacuum as normal. At caster level 10th, all creatures that suffer damage from the vacuum must succeed at a Fortitude save or become fatigued. \\n Earth: Disintegrate Earth:  Stone and crystalline entities begin to phase out of existence, weakening their defenses. All stone or crystalline objects in the area have their hardness reduced by half your caster level and creatures made of stone or crystal have any DR and natural armor bonuses they possess reduced by half your caster level (minimum 0). Weapons made of stone or crystal deal damage as if they were one size smaller plus an additional size smaller per 5 caster levels (minimum of 1 damage) and AC bonuses granted by armor and shields made of crystal or stone is reduced by half your caster level (minimum 0).

You may move this bubble as if it were a Vortex. An individual air bubble allows a creature to breathe underwater for 1 hour normally, but otherwise does not impede swimming. A larger air bubble traps significantly more air, and allows those inside to remain dry and walk on the ground at the bottom of the body of water as if it were ground. A large air bubble contains enough air for a Medium creature to breathe normally for 6 hours per 5 feet in the bubble's radius.

The movements you can choose are determined by the packages you possess. Air: Air Ball:  You gain a rideable sphere of compressed air, which can support 200 + 20 lbs. per caster level. This ball can float up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels above the ground, and has a movement speed equal to your base land speed. This ball is only usable by you, but others may ride along if the ball can support the weight of all riders. The ball is treated as a mount, but requires no Ride or Fly checks to use and cannot be affected by uses of those skills such as cover or spur mount, nor can be targeted by opponents. Earth: Burrow:  You can tunnel through sand, loose soil, or gravel, at a burrow speed equal to half your land speed (minimum 10 feet) or at a burrow speed equal to a quarter of your land speed through stone (minimum 5 feet). While burrowing with this talent you cannot charge or run. This ability does not grant you the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material, you must hold your breath and take only short trips or else you may suffocate. Fire: Ride the Flames:  You may use heat waves to push yourself, gaining a fly speed equal to your base land speed, with a maneuverability of clumsy. This fly speed only functions on your turn. If you are not on a surface that can support you on the end of your turn, you glide safely to the ground, at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no falling damage. You cannot use this fly speed to hover. Metal: Ironshod:  You become difficult to impede with traps, hazards, and difficult terrain. You reduce any damage you take from traps, hazards, and difficult terrain (including caltrops and spike stones) by your caster level, and you can still 5-foot step through difficult terrain. When moving through difficult terrain, you may completely ignore 5 feet of difficult terrain + 5 feet per 5 caster levels when calculating your movement for a round. Plant: Brachiate:  You gain a climb speed equal to half your land speed (minimum 10 feet), granting you all the usual benefits of a Climb speed, including a racial +8 bonus to Climb checks. In addition, you can move through the upper canopies of jungles and forests with the same ease you move along the ground. You can use your base land speed to move through any heavily forested area without touching the ground by leaping and swinging from tree to tree. You can also use this among the rafters of a building, or even stalactites on a cavern ceiling. Water: Water Walk:  You gain the ability to walk on water. Water and all other liquid becomes solid to you, allowing you to move over it as if it were normal ground. Especially turbulent water (such as during a storm) may count as difficult terrain. You may always choose to sink into the water and swim if you so desire, in which case you are considered to have a Swim speed equal to your land speed, granting you all the usual benefits of a Swim speed, including a racial +8 bonus to Swim checks. This does not, however, grant you the ability to breathe underwater.\"\n",

In addition to the effects that already possess a duration, if you possess the ability to grant (spirit) talent abilities to another you may spend a spell point as a standard action to grant a target the ability to use one of these attacks for 1 round per caster level. The options available are dependent on your Nature packages, as outlined below: Air: Cacophony:  As a standard action you may create a torrent of wind that deals sonic damage equal to 1d4 + 1 per caster level to all creatures and unattended objects within a cone that reaches from you to the edge of your geomancing range. Any creature damaged by the effect must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. Earth: Stone Fist:  As a free action you may encase one or both of your fists with stone for 1 round. While so encased, you cannot hold anything in that hand and suffer a -2 armor check penalty. You also are considered armed when making unarmed strikes with that hand, gain a +1 shield bonus to AC, and your unarmed strikes with that hand deal 1d6 damage Medium (1d4 Small) and ignore hardness less than 8. This damage increases by 1 die size (1d8, 1d10, 2d6, 2d8, etc.) every 4 caster levels you possess, and the shield bonus increases by 1 for every 6 caster levels you possess. This does not stack with monk levels or other effects that increase the damage of unarmed strikes. Fire: Fire Wielder:  As a free action you may create a fire in one or both of your hands. You are considered armed with this fire, and can treat it as a light weapon when making attacks. Attacks with this flame are touch attacks, and deal fire damage equal to the largest fire you can create with Create Fire. This fire cannot be augmented like a normal fire, and attacks with this fire are not augmented by your Strength modifier or effects that increase physical damage such as Power Attack, as flame is immaterial. You cannot be disarmed of this fire, but you may throw it as a ranged weapon attack with no range penalty to a maximum of your geomancing range. Metal: Blade Whip:  As a standard action you may reshape a mostly metal weapon (such as a sword or battleaxe) you are wielding into a cable and perform a trip, disarm or sunder combat maneuver against a target within your geomancing range. This is considered a ranged attack, and you cannot be targeted in return on a failure. You gain a bonus to the check equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). After the combat maneuver check has been resolved, your weapon returns to its original form. Plant: Bramble Strike:  You may spend a spell point as a standard action to cause brambles to burst from any mostly wooden weapon (such as a club, quarterstaff, or spear) you are wielding, or pieces of mostly-wooden ammunition such as an arrow or bolt coming from a ranged weapon you are using, for 1 round per caster level. Once per round when you strike a creature with one of your qualifying weapons, you may cause them to attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, the target becomes entangled for 1 round. For every 10 caster levels you possess, you may use this ability an additional time per round. Escaping this entanglement follows the same rules as escaping from the Entangle geomancing ability. If a creature fails their saving throw while already entangled from this effect, the condition's duration increases by 1 round. Water: Icicles:  You may spontaneously create an icicle in your hand as a free action. These icicles count as masterwork daggers and melt if they leave your hand for more than 1 round. These icicles gain a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels you possess (maximum +5) and deal an amount of extra cold damage equal to 1/2 your caster level.\"\n",

The powerful shockwave created by this ability knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground cannot move or attack. A caster on the ground must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster level) or lose any spell or sphere effect they try to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake depends on the nature of the terrain where it is created. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:  The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area who are below the falling debris and rubble. Cliffs:  The earthquake causes cliffs to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground:  Each creature standing in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the earthquake, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Suffocation rules in Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide for more details). Structure:  Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River, Lake, or Marsh:  Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of this effect, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. After the earthquake ends, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned Beneath Rubble:  Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must attempt a DC 15 Constitution check each minute thereafter until freed or dead, suffering 1d6 points of lethal damage for each failed save.\"\n",

A successful Reflex save halves the damage, but creatures with evasion still suffer 3d6 fire damage on a successful save. Starting in the second round of the geyser's eruption, the rapidly cooling water begins raining down on all targets within 30 feet of the geyser, lasting for the length of the effect +1d3 rounds. Any creature caught in this freezing downpour takes 10d6 points of cold damage each round and is entangled by the layer of frost and ice forming on it. Even creatures affected by the main geyser who failed their Reflex save but left the area of cold rain find themselves entangled as the water on them freezes. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the entangled condition, but still deals 2d6 cold damage to creatures with evasion who successfully save. While a creature outside the affected area finds their entangled condition leaves after 1 round as the ice melts, creatures who remain within the affected area are affected each round, with each additional failed save causing its speed to be reduced by 10 feet.

      "            \"benefits\": \"Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((plant) package, Create Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th. You may spend 3 spell points to create a massive growth of plantlife. This affects up to a 1/2 mile radius area in one of the following ways: Change Terrain:  You may change the terrain in this area to forest or jungle. This does not cause animals native to the forest or jungle to appear, nor does it guarantee that the terrain type will stay that way indefinitely (some areas such as deserts or high mountains cannot support forests or jungles, and a forest or jungle created in these locations may die out over time) but in all other ways, the terrain changes to the selected type. Improve Forest:  If used in an area that already contains a forest or jungle, you may cause the area to grow rapidly. Typical trees become massive trees, all areas become covered in undergrowth, and areas already covered in undergrowth gain heavy undergrowth. A creature standing in the same square as a typical tree gains partial cover, which grants a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves. The presence of a tree does not otherwise affect a creature's fighting space, because it is assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness 5, and 150 hit points. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb a tree. Massive trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hit points. Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them. Space covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees are not mutually exclusive; it is common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth. Increase Yield:  If used in an area of developed farmland, you double the crop production in that area for the rest of the harvest season. This has no effect if used in winter or other times when crops are not being tended.\"\n",

As a concentration effect, you spend 2 spell points to create a wave of water 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide per caster level, and 2 feet tall per caster level. This wave moves in a straight line at 60 feet per round over water (30 feet per round over land), and if not combined with Create Water, must originate from a large body of water. It travels perpendicular to its width, and may be maintained for no more than 5 rounds. Creatures struck by the tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage) and are subject to a special CMB check. The wave's CMB is equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave's CMB check. If a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried along by the wave. Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space\\u2014if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement or the Freedom word prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature. A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.\"\n",

As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to call lava up from deep within the earth. This lava bursts from a 10 feet wide hole in the ground centered within range and creates a spout 10 feet high per 2 caster levels. Any creature in this area or who enters this area takes 10d6 points of fire damage and is hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground, suffering falling damage based upon the height of the volcanic spray (e.g., if the volcano is 80 feet tall, the creature takes 8d6 falling damage) and lands prone in a random square adjacent to the spout. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the fire damage and the creature is not tossed into the air, instead moving to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement. In addition, the volcano sprays lava, smoke, and poison gas in a hemispherical emanation around itself. The radius of this emanation is equal to one half the volcano's height (e.g., an 80 foot spout has a 40-foot radius emanation). All creatures within this area, including yourself, have concealment and suffer 2d6 points of fire damage each round as lava cascades on them. They also suffer 1d6 Constitution damage per round as they inhale poisonous gas (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save), as Vog severity level 7 from the Weather sphere. Even after a creature leaves the lava-filled area, they suffer 1d6 points of damage for 1d3 rounds as the lava already on them cools. A volcano must be created on the ground and cannot be created in other places, such as on the 2nd floor of a building. You can choose to make a smaller volcano than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of lava that's smaller than your maximum.\"\n",

This world generates naturally and consistent across all extradimensional rooms you create as well as your extradimensional storage. The elements of this world take up no space in an extradimensional storage. By increasing the action of geomancing by one step, you can simultaneously open a portal to your world to access the elements within. The world's exact composition depend on the geomancing packages you possess: Air:  Your world possesses a breathable atmosphere and miniature storms. Each round, it produces enough air to sustain a Medium-sized creature or to create a single instantaneous use of air geomancing in an airless environment. Earth:  Your world is formed of soft soil and sand. You may use this soil and sand to generate things like dust storms if you possess that capacity, or you may open a portal beneath a target to form a solid earthen surface underneath them, to a maximum size of a 10-foot square. Fire:  Your world is rich in fuel and produces a constant flame. A Tiny-sized fire burns within it at all times. If it is extinguished, it reignites one round later if conditions permit. Metal:  Your world is shot through with veins of metal. You can use recover ore to extract a Tiny-sized piece of metal ore from your world each day. Plant:  Your world grows plantlife that produces enough food to sustain a Medium-sized creature for a day. These plants can be used for the entangle and harvest abilities any number of times per day, but they are not large enough to count as a tree. Water:  Your world contains rivers and oceans. It produces enough clean water to sustain a Medium-sized creature for a day. You may generate fog from this water any number of times per day, though it is not large enough to produce effects such as a vortex.

The branch or tree makes an attack roll as an antagonize skill check against the target's Psychology DC (14 + 1/2 HD + WIS modifier; or 14 + Sense Motive Bonus, if it is higher). Creatures who are of animal intelligence (1 or 2), or have been previously antagonized gain a +4 bonus to their Psychology DC. Both of these stack. Mindless creatures are immune to the effects of antagonize. Antagonize is a mind-affecting effect. If you successfully beat the target's psychology DC, the creature, instead of taking damage, gains the antagonized condition against the attacking vegetation. The antagonized condition remains for 1 round. The duration of this condition increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat your opponent's Psychology DC. You may not use this ability if you would already deal no damage with your pummel. Antagonized Condition:  The antagonized condition appears in Ultimate Charisma, published and copyrighted by Everyman's Game, LLC. An antagonized creature can only target its antagonist (the one who caused the antagonized condition) with hostile actions. A hostile action is any attack or effect that causes direct harm to an opponent in the form of damage, negative conditions, or any other effect that penalizes or hinders a creature. Furthermore, an antagonized creature does not threaten any opponents except its antagonist: it cannot make attacks of opportunity or be used to determine flanking bonuses against other opponents. A creature is no longer antagonized if its antagonist is helpless, unconscious, or cannot participate in combat. If an antagonizes creature uses an ability that targets multiple creatures, the antagonist must be chosen among these targets. If an antagonized creature uses an ability that targets an area, its antagonist must be within the ability's targeted area. On each round after the first, an antagonized creature may attempt a Sense Motive skill check as a swift action to realize the folly of its actions. This skill check is opposed by the antagonist's original antagonize skill check. If the creature succeeds on its Sense Motive skill check, the antagonized condition ends, but the creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty to the saving throw DC of its abilities and any spells it casts for 1 minute. These penalties do not apply against the antagonist. Attacking Vegetation Under the Effect of Pummel Players and Game Masters alike may require the armor class, hardness, and hit point values of the branches or trees affected by pummel. While particular species of vegetation may cause for variance in these values, the table below are some that are suggested which may be used should such a situation arise. Branches and trees under the effect of pummel are still objects and thus always fail saving throws. Branches as objects gain the broken condition if they lose over 50% of their hit points, and are destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Trees animated through the enhancement sphere should not use these statistics, but rather those provided for animated objects. Size \\n Example \\n Armor Class \\n Hardness \\n Hit Points \\n \\n \\n Medium \\n Secondary Branch or Sapling \\n 7 \\n 5 \\n 5 \\n \\n \\n Large \\n Primary Branch or Young Tree \\n 6 \\n 5 \\n 15 \\n \\n \\n Huge \\n Juvenile Tree \\n 5 \\n 5 \\n 50 \\n \\n \\n Gargantuan \\n Typical Adult Tree \\n 4 \\n 5 \\n 150 \\n \\n \\n Colossal \\n Massive Tree \\n 3 \\n 5 \\n 500 Number of Branches Per Size Category of Tree Tree Size \\n Number of Medium Branches \\n Number of Large Branches \\n Number of Huge Branches \\n \\n \\n Huge \\n 1d4 (avg 3) \\n - \\n - \\n \\n \\n Gargantuan \\n 3d4 (avg 8) \\n 1d4 (avg 3) \\n - \\n \\n \\n Colossal \\n 9d4 (avg 23) \\n 3d4 (avg 8) \\n 1d4 (avg 3) Because trees are objects, it is recommended that destroying a branch also reduces the overall health of each larger branch and tree by an equal amount. For example, if a juvenile tree has 4 medium branches, then destroying all four would reduce the tree's hit points by 20, leaving it with 30 hp remaining. In the case of a massive tree, destroying 1 medium branch would reduce 1 large branch, 1 huge branch and the colossal tree's hit points by 5.\"\n",

Ethereal creatures are technically stopped by the barrier, but can usually find a way around it (as the barrier does not cut through objects, and so usually stops at ground level). Creatures inside a space where a barrier is created are shunted to the nearest empty space on the outside. A barrier has hit points equal to twice your caster level and a Break DC of 15 + 1/2 your caster level. A barrier can hold weight, up to 2,400 lbs. + 250 lbs. per caster level; beyond that, a barrier simply shatters as if broken with a Strength check. If a barrier is broken anywhere, the entire effect ends. If an attack is directed at a target through the barrier, the attack first deals its damage to the barrier itself. If this damage is enough to destroy the barrier, the attack continues on to its intended target, although damage dealt to the barrier is subtracted from any damage done to the target or targets. Burst-effect attacks such as splash weapons, fireball spells, or others attempting to travel through the barrier explode at the barrier's edge and also must overcome the barrier's hit points to damage targets on the other side.

A glyph is cast upon a 5-foot-by- 5-foot area and takes the form of a 6 inch tall symbol, faintly visible on a surface. The glyph lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until activated by a trigger specified by the caster at the time it is created. When activated, the glyph becomes the center point for the ward, and it performs its function for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, and then the ability ends. Once cast, the glyph cannot be moved from its location, unless its complete surface is movable (for example, if cast on the deck of a ship). Destroying the surface the glyph is on destroys it, but does not end the glyph effect once it has been triggered. If you have the Permanent Ward advanced talent, you may make a glyph that is permanent, and will activate with its trigger, stay active for as long as the trigger is active, and shut off afterwards until triggered again. Creating a glyph requires a round per caster level and a spell point. You must also pay the spell point cost of whatever ward the glyph will create, though you do not need to spend a spell point to maintain the ward: the glyph can maintain the ward as if it were concentrating. When you create the glyph, you may decide what area is covered by the glyph's effect; this may be up to close range from the location of the glyph. You set all of the conditions of the glyph when it is created. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when creating the glyph) triggers the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to chaos, evil, good, or law, or to pass those of a particular religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if, for example, a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded. A glyph knows when it has been read, which may be used as part of a trigger. A glyph can only have one trigger, but you can always trigger your own glyph as a free action, provided you are still on the same plane of existence. A glyph can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and can also be detected as a magical trap can be. In order for someone to spot one of your glyphs it requires a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Disabling the glyph requires a Disable Device check with the same DC. Alternatively, destroying the surface the glyph is imprinted on can destroy the glyph, but once activated, destroying the glyph does not dispel the effect, and the glyph activates when damaged if the damage is not sufficient to destroy it.\"\n",

When you create a glyph, you may substitute an ability that you possess from another sphere in place of a ward. This ability must either target an area, or must have the ability to attack creatures. When triggered, the glyph activates the ability. For an ability with a duration, it lasts for 1 round per caster level (even if the original duration of the ability was longer), while an instantaneous ability activates once against whomever triggered the glyph, or a random target within range if that is not applicable. You must pay the full spell point cost of the sphere ability the glyph contains. You do not need to pay a spell point to maintain an effect without concentration - the glyph maintains the effect as if it were concentrated on. A glyph cannot discern automatically between allies and enemies; only those who trigger them and those who have not. This extends to the substitute effects which normally would be able to distinguish between allies and enemies. If you possess the Cantrips feat, you may use any simple magical effect the Cantrips feat can create (such as a simple alarm, or having an illusionary mouth appear and deliver a short message) with the glyph instead of a sphere ability. Counterspell may also be substituted for a sphere ability. Similarly, you may add a non-magical trap (such as those constructed with the Craft skill) to a glyph in place of a sphere ability. A complex glyph uses your caster level with the sphere of the sphere ability to determine the effect of the sphere ability, but uses your Protection caster level to determine its own properties.\"\n",

The Abjurer's Handbook \\n$4.99 Other spells or sphere effects, however, such as teleportation effects, mind-altering magic, and gaze attacks may all bypass this ward. Ethereal creatures are technically stopped by the barrier, but can usually find a way around it (as the barrier does not cut through objects, and so usually stops at ground level). A barrier has hit points equal to 4 + your caster level and a Break DC of 15 + 1/2 your caster level. If an attack is directed at a target through the barrier, the attack first deals its damage to the barrier itself. If this damage is enough to destroy the barrier, the attack continues on to its intended target, although damage dealt to the barrier is subtracted from any damage done to the target or targets. Burst-effect attacks such as splash weapons, fireball spells, or others attempting to travel through the barrier explode at the barrier's edge and also must overcome the barrier's hp to damage targets on the other side. If you maintain your barrier through concentration, its HP is renewed each round on your turn. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, barriers created with the Protection sphere are transparent force effects and block line of effect, but do not block line of sight or teleportation. Barriers can grant cover, but not concealment (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Aegis [Core] As a standard action, you may touch a creature and spend a spell point, granting them an aegis for 1 hour per caster level. Unwilling targets are allowed a Will save to resist gaining an aegis. Multiple aegises of the same talent can be placed on a single creature, and the creature can benefit from them when they are providing different effects. This means Armored Magic can give a target both armor and shield, and Energy Resistance can grant resistance to multiple energy types to the same target.

A glyph is cast upon a 5 ft. by 5 ft. area and takes the form of a 6 inch tall symbol, faintly visible on a surface. The glyph lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until activated by a trigger specified by the caster at the time it is created. When activated, the glyph become the center point for the ward, and it performs its function for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, and then the ability ends. Once cast, the glyph can not be moved from its location, and any attempt to do so fails. Destroying the surface the glyph is on destroys it, but doesn't end the glyph effect once it has been triggered. Creating a glyph requires a round per caster level and a spell point. You must also pay the spell point cost of whatever ward the glyph will create, though you do not need to spend a spell point to maintain the ward: the glyph can maintain the ward as if it were concentrating. When you create the glyph, you may decide what area is covered by the glyph's effect; this may be up to close range from the location of the glyph. A glyph is as intelligent as its caster, and can see and hear as well as a humanoid could with regular senses and a bonus to Perception equal to your caster level, so the trigger can be one of many things, but the glyph runs the risk of being deceived if the trigger is too complicated. A glyph can only have one trigger, but you can always trigger your own glyph as a free action, provided you are still on the same plane of existence. A glyph knows when it has been read. This information may be used as part of a trigger. When a glyph you created activates, its effect begins. The glyph's effect can be any ward you know how to create. If you have the Permanent Ward advanced talent, you may make a glyph that is permanent, and will activate with it's trigger, stay active for as long as the trigger is active, and shut off afterwards until triggered again. A glyph can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and can also be detected as a magical trap can be. In order for someone to spot one of your glyphs it requires a Perception Check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Disabling the glyph requires a Disable Device check with the same DC. Alternatively, destroying the surface the glyph is imprinted on can destroy the glyph, but once activated, destroying the glyph does not dispel the effect, and the glyph activates when damaged if the damage is not sufficient to destroy it.\"\n",

You must succeed at an attack roll using your base attack bonus plus your casting ability against the target. On a successful hit, the target and the bludgeon take damage depending on the bludgeon's size. If the bludgeon is a weapon, the attack deals appropriate damage for that weapon (bolts and arrows are treated as daggers for this purpose). Since weapons are designed to deal damage, they do not suffer damage if used as a bludgeon.\\\" The damage type of Bludgeon depends on the object being wielded, but generally deals bludgeoning damage. However, a spiked grate might deal bludgeoning and piercing damage, while a shaving razor would deal slashing damage. A Bludgeon always deals a form of weapon damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), though it might be used to attack someone with an object that deals additional damage of another type (such as wooden object that has been set on fire). You do not need to be proficient with a weapon to use it effectively as a Bludgeon, and you do not take non-proficiency or improvised weapon penalties to your attack roll with a Bludgeon. When using an object as a bludgeon, any special properties that would apply to wielding it as a weapon apply to it as a bludgeon. A masterwork or enchanted weapon gains its enhancement bonus, and it uses any relevant special weapon abilities. A chunk of adamantine will overcome adamantine-keyed damage reduction and ignore hardness less than 20, and a lit torch will deal fire damage. The GM has final say on whether or not a property functions when the weapon is used as a bludgeon (example: flaming would cause the bludgeon to deal additional fire damage, but throwing would do nothing, as the weapon is the weapon is not being 'thrown' in a traditional sense.)\"\n",

Acceleration Acceleration can benefit from feats or abilities that would give you a full attack at the end of a Charge (such as pounce), but even in conjunction with Divided Mind and/or Mobile Bludgeon you are still limited to your normal number of attacks each round. Dancing Weapon Because dancing weapons are controlled as if you were wielding them, they can threaten the areas around them. However, dancing weapons do not possess the natural reach of a wielder. Instead, a dancing weapon has reach that corresponds to its object size. Tiny and smaller objects only threaten the square they are positioned in, while weapons with the reach gain the normal benefits and drawbacks. Even if you are lifting multiple weapons with Divided Mind, you are limited to your normal amount of attacks of opportunity each round. Table: Dancing Weapon Reach Size \\n Reach \\n \\n \\n Fine \\n 0 ft \\n \\n \\n Diminutive \\n 0 ft \\n \\n \\n Tiny \\n 0 ft \\n \\n \\n Small \\n 5 ft \\n \\n \\n Medium \\n 5 ft \\n \\n \\n Large \\n 5 ft \\n \\n \\n Huge \\n 10 ft \\n \\n \\n Gargantuan \\n 15 ft \\n \\n \\n Colossal \\n 20 ft You can flank with your own Dancing Weapon. Divided Mind When combining sizes to determine how much you can lift with Divided Mind, two objects of the same size category are equivalent to one object of a larger category. For example, two Small objects are equal to one Medium object, and four Medium objects are equal to two Large objects, or one Huge object. When making multiple bludgeon attacks per round with Divided Mind you must use a different object for each bludgeon attack unless you have the Mobile Bludgeon talent. When using multiple lifted objects as a single bludgeon, combine their size and determine damage as if they were a single object of that size. If one or more of these objects is a weapon the size category is effectively one size larger when determining damage. You add all weapon damage types together when using multiple objects as a single bludgeon-\\u2014so a bludgeon composed of blunt objects would only do bludgeoning damage, while if you later added a shortspear to the objects you wielded it would deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. Quick Reference Table: Density of Common Materials Density \\n Material \\n Effective size \\n \\n \\n Superdense \\n Adamantine, lead, gold, silver \\n One size larger \\n \\n \\n Dense \\n Flesh, iron, mithral, sand, soil, stone, water, wood \\n Standard size \\n \\n \\n Light \\n Charcoal, cork, darkwood, flour, hay, snow \\n One size smaller \\n \\n \\n Weightless \\n Balsa wood, featherglass, feathers, shredded paper \\n Two sizes smaller The density table assumes the substance is packed together in a natural manner - if this changes, the density is altered as well. While a hollow sculpture of carefully joined paper sheets is effectively weightless, a bound book of paper sheets is little different in density than the wood it was made from. Similarly, while lightly packed snow is light, a drift from a new, dry snowfall could be weightless, while the snow comprising the terrain of an ancient glacier is dense. In general, density categories follow the density of water as a baseline. Materials or objects ten times as dense as water are superdense, materials and objects half the density of water are light, while materials and objects a tenth the density of water are weightless. Note that a weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. For example, a one-handed club sized for a medium creature is an object of tiny size. In general, adjust size category as follows: Table: Weapon Sizes Weapon Type \\n Size Adjustment \\n \\n \\n Ammunition \\n Three sizes smaller \\n \\n \\n Light Weapons \\n Two sizes smaller \\n \\n \\n One-Handed Weapons \\n One size smaller \\n \\n \\n Two-Handed Weapons \\n Same size This is a general guideline to weapon size rather than a hard rule, and exceptions exist (such as daggers which are three sizes smaller, or shurikens which are four). The exact size of a given weapon is ultimately up to the GM.

This damage does not force concentration checks to cast or maintain sphere effects or spells. \\n \\n \\n 21 \\n The target spins in place violently, receiving a -4 to attack rolls but gaining +2 dodge bonus to AC for the duration of the lift. The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated for the duration of the lift. A new save may be made as a move action each round; success reducing the nauseated condition to sickened. \\n \\n \\n 22 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the weight of the caster's equipment is halved. \\n \\n \\n 23 \\n All creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area are crushed by a telekinetic force, suffering 1 bludgeoning damage per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 24 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster (excluding the caster) are crushed by a telekinetic force, suffering 1 bludgeoning damage per caster level per round for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 25 \\n All hostile creatures within close range of the target are targeted by a bull rush maneuver straight downward as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent.

Any weapon successfully disarmed in this way immediately makes a single attack against its former wielder as the bludgeon ability then drops to the ground. \\n \\n \\n 27 \\n The caster is fatigued. \\n \\n \\n 28 \\n For 1 day per caster level, the caster is immune to falling damage. \\n \\n \\n 29 \\n The caster makes a single magical skill check against all Telekinesis sphere effects within medium range to dispel them as if using the Counterspell feat. This is resolved after the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 30 \\n (Combat) All allied creatures within close range of the caster are targeted by a bull rush maneuver straight downward as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. This deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 ft. a creature is unable to move. \\n \\n \\n 31 \\n All allied creatures within close range of the caster are targeted by a grapple check as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. These grapple attempts persist against each affected creature for 1 round per caster level or until the creature manages to break free of the grapple or the grapple attempt fails. Once grappled, the effect attempts to pin, then deal damage each round. \\n \\n \\n 32 \\n All creatures within close range of the target are bull rushed away from the target as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 33 \\n All allied creatures within close range of the caster have their held weapons targeted by a disarm maneuver as the Steal talent. Weapons successfully disarmed in this way move toward the caster at up to his lift speed then drop to the ground. \\n \\n \\n 34 \\n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 35 \\n One object currently in the caster's hands flies away at his lift speed and attempts to strike the nearest creature (other than the caster) within lift range as the bludgeon ability. The object drops to the ground after one such attack. \\n \\n \\n 36 \\n All creatures within close range of the target are tripped as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 37 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the loads of all creatures within lift range of the target are reduced by 5 lbs per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 38 \\n (Combat) Movement becomes unstable around the caster. For 1 round per caster level, every time a creature (other than the caster) begins their movement within close range of the caster, they must succeed on a Will save or move in a random direction. Their movement pattern stays the same, but the direction moved is determined randomly, as a miss with a splash weapon. \\n \\n \\n 39 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the loads of all creatures within lift range of the target are increased by 5 lbs per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 40 \\n For 1 round per caster level, one weapon in the caster's possession but that is not currently wielded leaves the caster's possession and attempts to stay as far from the caster as possible, to the limits of his lift range. \\n \\n \\n 41 \\n Effect receives a +2 bonus to caster level. \\n \\n \\n 42 \\n The target or creatures in the target area immediately fly 100 ft. in a random direction, (as a splash weapon miss). They move to the furthest safe space in this direction up to this distance and stop; they cannot slam into a wall or pass through or end the movement in an intrinsically dangerous space. \\n \\n \\n 43 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or begin falling upward at a rate of 5 ft. per round. This effect prevents the creature from falling but otherwise has no impact on the creature's movement for that round, provided it has a move speed suitable to its environment (flight if in the air, swim if below water, burrow if underground). This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 44 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all ranged attacks are drawn to the caster, granting a +1 + 1 per 5 caster level circumstance bonus on all ranged attacks made with natural or manufactured weapons targeting the caster. \\n \\n \\n 45 \\n One object currently in the caster's hands flies away at his lift speed and attempts to strike the nearest hostile creature within lift range as the bludgeon ability. The object drops to the ground after one such attack. \\n \\n \\n 46 \\n The casting time decreases by 2 steps. \\n \\n \\n 47 \\n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \\n \\n \\n 48 \\n (Combat) Every creature within close range of the caster is suddenly tied up in any belts, laces, or straps that are part of their clothing. If they are wearing clothing or carrying belts or bags, they become entangled for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 49 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster are targeted by a drag maneuver as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent, moving them toward the caster. \\n \\n \\n 50 \\n The casting time increases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 51 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 52 \\n All hostile creatures within close range of the target are targeted by a drag maneuver toward the target as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 53 \\n Invisible force aids motion. For 1 round per caster level, all squares within close range of the caster cost half the normal movement cost. \\n \\n \\n 54 \\n All allied creatures within close range of the caster have their held weapons targeted by a disarm maneuver as the Steal talent. Weapons successfully disarmed in this way move toward the caster at up to his lift speed and attempt and attack against him as the bludgeon ability, then drop to the ground. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n All hostile creatures within close range of the caster have their held weapons targeted by a disarm maneuver as the Steal talent. Weapons successfully disarmed in this way move toward the caster at up to his lift speed then drop to the ground. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n Once per round for 1 round per caster level, a small unattended non-magical object (stone, twig, spoon, etc.) flies toward the caster's head, inflicting 1 point of nonlethal damage, then falls unharmed to the ground. A successful Reflex save negates this damage each round. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n All hostile creatures within close range of the caster have their held weapons targeted by a disarm maneuver as the Steal talent. Any weapon successfully disarmed in this way immediately makes a single attack against its former wielder as the bludgeon ability then drops to the ground. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the loads of all creatures within lift range of the caster are increased by 5 lbs per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n All creatures within close range of the target are targeted by a bull rush maneuver straight downward as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. This deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 5 ft. a creature is unable to move. \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the weight of the equipment of all creatures within close range is halved. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all ranged attacks near the caster are partially deflected, imposing a -1 - 1 per 5 caster level penalty on all ranged attacks made with natural or manufactured weapons targeting creatures within close range of the caster. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n (Combat) All allied creatures within close range of the target are targeted by a bull rush maneuver away from the target as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 64 \\n All hostile creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area are are targeted by a bull rush check to move them directly away from the target or center of the target area as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 65 \\n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of his choice from this sphere for 1 round. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n The caster immediately flies 100 ft. in a random direction, (as a splash weapon miss). The caster moves to the furthest safe space in this direction up to this distance and stops; the caster cannot slam into a wall or pass through or end the movement in an intrinsically dangerous space. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n All unattended objects of Small size or smaller within close range of the caster begin to spin slowly, like a top, for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n For 1 day per caster level, the caster takes double falling damage. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n For 1 round per caster level, all ranged attacks are repelled from the caster, imposing a -1 - 1 per 5 caster level penalty on all ranged attacks made with natural or manufactured weapons targeting the caster for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n One object currently in the caster's hands flies away at his lift speed and attempts to strike the caster as the bludgeon ability. The object drops to the ground after one such attack. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n Telekinetic forced grab creatures' fists and feet and force them to hit themselves. All creatures within close range of the caster (including the caster) must immediately deal their unarmed strike damage to themselves. \\n \\n \\n 72 \\n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are lost. \\n \\n \\n 73 \\n The caster makes a single magical skill check against all Telekinesis sphere effects within medium range to dispel them as if using the Counterspell feat. This is resolved before the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 74 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the weight of the equipment of all creatures within close range is doubled. \\n \\n \\n 75 \\n Telekinetic force increases the weight of the target creature or object, allowing it to be treated as being 2 sizes larger than it is when calculating its bludgeoning damage. \\n \\n \\n 76 \\n The caster floats 1 inch off the ground for 10 minutes per caster level. This has no impact on movement speeds or falling damage. \\n \\n \\n 77 \\n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 78 \\n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \\n \\n \\n 79 \\n For 1 hour per caster level, the loads of all creatures within lift range of the caster are reduced by 5 lbs per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 80 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster have their held weapons targeted by a disarm maneuver as the Steal talent. Weapons successfully disarmed in this way move toward the caster at up to his lift speed then drop to the ground. \\n \\n \\n 81 \\n All creatures within close range of the caster are bull rushed away from the caster as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 82 \\n The caster spins in place, receiving a -2 to attack rolls but gaining +1 dodge bonus to AC for the duration of the effect. The caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or be sickened for the duration of the effect. \\n \\n \\n 83 \\n Invisible force hinders motion. For 1 round per caster level, all squares within close range of the caster cost double the normal movement cost and 5-foot steps are impossible. \\n \\n \\n 84 \\n The caster has their feet manipulated telekinetically, making them dance uncontrollably. Their movement is halved. \\n \\n \\n 85 \\n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \\n \\n \\n 86 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 87 \\n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \\n \\n \\n 88 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 89 \\n (Combat) All allied creatures within close range of the caster are targeted by a bull rush maneuver away from the caster as the Telekinetic Maneuver talent. \\n \\n \\n 90 \\n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster partially levitates, reducing ground-based movement speeds by half and taking a penalty to CMD against bullrush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers equal to caster level. \\n \\n \\n 91 \\n One object currently in the caster's hands flies away at his lift speed and attempts to strike the nearest allied creature (other than the caster) within lift range as the bludgeon ability.

Weapons successfully disarmed in this way move toward the caster at up to his lift speed and attempt and attack against him as the bludgeon ability, then drop to the ground. Gamemastering Clarifications This section is devoted to elaborating on existing Spheres of Power material, clarifying and offering suggestions for specific situations or uses of the Telekinesis Sphere. Telekinesis Items lifted by telekinesis are considered to be attended or held by the creature lifting them. If a character attempts to use telekinesis on a target that is under the effect of another character's telekinesis, he must make a successful CMB check against their CMD to wrest control of the target. While most things a telekinetic will want to lift are solid, discrete objects, it is possible that you will want to lift a fluid or less cohesive mass, such as a pool of water or a pile of sand. The recommended default is that a telekinetic should be able to lift a mass equal to their standard telekinesis size limit, but under certain circumstances or in different settings a GM might want to impose stricter limits. A GM might choose to rule that some substances are more difficult than normal to manipulate with telekinesis (such as gases or more volatile fluids such as alchemist's fire) and impose an effective size penalty, or say that cannot effectively be lifted with telekinesis at all without the proper skills. In such cases it is recommended that the Telekinetic Tools talent could be used to mimic a sack or bucket to scoop up fluids and fine grains, and the Finesse talent allowed to properly handle volatile chemicals or more tricky materials such as gases.\"\n",

If multiple motes would be created as part of casting the same sphere effect, you may give each temporal mote a different set of conditions. A temporal mote with conditions cannot have their duration ended early as part of a standard action. Example:  Meowlin is a mischievous prankster. He casts a delayed telekinesis effect modified with Divided Mind, targeting a number of vases and other fragile items in his owner's home. Meowlin decides to have the temporal motes last 12 rounds, rather than the full 18 rounds equal to his Time sphere caster level, and gives each one a trigger to \\\"bonk Jennifer when she walks into the kitchen\\\". 1 minute later (10 rounds), Jennifer walks into the kitchen and the temporal motes trigger, causing the multiple objects to fly off the shelves and \\\"bonk\\\" her, behaving as a Bludgeon (although no more Bludgeons than normally capable with Divided Mind). If Meowlin spent an additional spell point to use sustained force on the objects, they would continue to be under his telekinesis. Otherwise, the objects will fall after completing their trigger.\"\n",

This functions as a regular totem, except that it has a radius of 30 feet, it moves with the object it is attached to, and is dispelled if the object is destroyed. totemic emblems continue to function if they go beyond long range of their creator, but the creator can only rally those within that totem if they are within long range. The recipient object must be within range (adjacent to you, or in close range if you possess the Ranged Totem talent). An unwilling creature can have a totem attached to its equipment as a touch attack; no saving throw is allowed, but the Break Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or a similar effect can dispel the totem before its natural duration expires. An object with a totem attached to it still receives any saving throws the totem allows to avoid being affected. A successful save means it is unaffected by the totem, but it remains attached to it and it still affects those within range of the totem. Spell resistance can prevent a totemic emblem from being attached to an object. Failing to bypass the intended target's spell resistance in attempting to attach the totem dispels the totem.

When using the Extradimensional Room talent, you may spend 3 spell points to create your extradimensional room as an instantaneous effect; it becomes a permanent demiplane and cannot be dispelled, no matter who is or is not inside. Alternatively, you may use this ability to create a new portal to a permanent demiplane you have previously created. You may permanently close a portal to your demiplane as a free action, but know that only interdimensional travel can reach a demiplane without a working portal. As a permanent demiplane, you have much more control over the composition, appearance, and contents of your room. The demiplane can be filled with air or water (your choice), and could have an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \\\"walls\\\" and \\\"ceiling\\\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. While it is still generally featureless, you may transplant plants or animals to your demiplane to create an ecosystem and manipulate the earth, water, and/or stone of the demiplane as you would any other materials. If you possess the Blood sphere in addition, you may include blood in any place that you would normally be able to place water. This blood can be supernaturally resistant to congealing, remaining liquid for indefinite periods of time. If you use this ability while within your demiplane, you may either permanently increase its size by an additional 10-foot cube per caster level, or add or remove one of the following traits to the entire demiplane: Energy:  You grant your demiplane the (minor) negative- or positive-dominant energy trait. A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits. Magic:  You may grant your plane the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you select dead magic, you are affected along with everything else and cannot cast on your plane. If you select enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \\\"effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\\\" or \\\"death spells and effects\\\". A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of magic. Morphic:  Your plane reacts to your thoughts; you may adjust the terrain's shape as an at-will ability. By concentrating for 1 minute, you may adjust a 150-foot square (10 feet deep) portion of earth, stone, or plantlife, shaping it however you will. This is not fast enough to do damage or trap creatures, but may be used to create fences and walls, ditches, human shapes, embankments, and others. Portal:  If you possess the Planeshift advanced talent, you may grant your demiplane a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it). Time:  By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. If you possess the Time sphere, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time, GameMastery Guide p. 185). Alignment:  If you possess the Fate sphere, you can grant your plane the (mildly) chaos-, evil-, good-, law-, or neutral- aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, Gamemastery Guide p. 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have. Bountiful:  If you possess the Nature sphere, you may grant your demiplane a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane per day. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on; dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations. Elemental:  You may grant your plane the air-, earth-, fire- , or water-elemental dominant trait. Gravity:  By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. You may adjust the plane's gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional. Weather:  If you possess the Weather sphere, you may grant a weather and seasonal cycle to your demiplane, customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter or have week-long seasons). Shape:  By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. You may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge. You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane. Structure:  You may give your demiplane a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what abilities you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner.)\"\n",

The area lasts for as long as you concentrate (or one minute per caster level if you spend a spell point) and measures one 10-foot cube. You may increase the area by an additional 10-foot cube per 5 caster levels, arranged as you wish so long as the entire area is contiguous. The effects that can be mimicked are as follows (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Planar Adventures for rules on these traits). If an effect which is created within the area of this aura leaves the aura, it loses any modifications which it would possess as a result of being in the area. Alignment:  The manifest zone gains the chaos-, evil-, good-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment traits corresponding to the plane. \\n Elemental:  The manifest zone gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait corresponding to the plane. (requires caster level 10th) \\n Energy:  The manifest zone gains the minor negative- or minor positive-dominant energy trait corresponding to the plane. At caster level 15th, it may gain the major negative- or major positive- dominant energy trait corresponding to the plane. \\n Gravity:  The manifest zone's gravity is heavy, light, or normal, corresponding to the plane. At caster level 15th, you may choose to make the gravity none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional, corresponding to the plane. \\n Magic:  The manifest zone gains the enhanced magic, impeded magic, limited magic, normal magic, or wild magic planar traits corresponding to the plane. At caster level 20th, you may choose to make the manifest zone dead magic (which does not cause the manifest zone itself to end or be suppressed). \\n Time:  If the mimicked plane has a rate of time different from normal time, the manifest zone is affected in different ways. All creatures within the manifest zone (including the caster) are affected.\\n \\n Erratic Time:  The manifest zone is affected as per the Time Bubble time sphere talent with a caster level equal to your Warp sphere caster level.

You may spend 10 minutes and 3 spell points to enhance the body part of a touched creature so that it functions as if it were connected to the rest of the body regardless of where it is. For example, if you were to use this effect on an eye and remove it from a person's skull, the owner would still be able to see out of that eye. A detached hand or arm could still manipulate objects on its own. Organs separated from the body are typically objects 2 sizes smaller than the creature they belong to and do not have any bonuses to AC. They are considered to have a Strength score equal to half of their owner. Any damage dealt to an organ is transferred to the organ's owner. If an organ has some sort of mobility (such as a hand crawling or a head pushing itself around using its tongue), the organ is considered to have a movement speed of 5 feet. You use your own actions to move this organ. A creature takes no damage when an organ affected by this talent is removed or when it is reattached (a standard action which requires that the owner touch the organ). If you reattach an organ to your body, the effects of this ability remain, allowing you to freely detach it again. Creatures may remove vital organs such as hearts, and lungs from their body and hide them elsewhere. Each organ removed in this way gives the creature a cumulative 10% chance to negate critical hits and precision damage against them as per the fortification armor special ability. This effect is cumulative, but does not stack with any similar effects such as fortification armor. This talent may safely remove one organ from a creature per 4 caster levels. A creature may not have their brain removed with this talent. Removal or detachment of organs through this talent are permanent until dismissed or dispelled. If this effect is dispelled (which requires the organ be targeted with the dispel rather than the person the organ belonged to), the organ teleports back to the owner's body so long as the distance between the owner and the organ does not exceed your teleport range (or close range if you cannot teleport). If the organ could not teleport back its owner or is beyond this range, the organ explodes harmlessly and the caster painfully grows a replacement, taking 2d6 points of Constitution drain in the process (or taking 10d6 damage which cannot be reduced or redirected if they are immune to ability drain or lack a Constitution score).\"\n",

To see how accurate the teleportation is, consult Table: Mishap found on True Teleport. Your familiarity with the destination time is relative, and knowledge of the destination time may be determined by succeeding on a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check. Succeeding on this check means the caster is treated as the destination time as having been \\\"viewed once\\\", and for every 5 you exceed the DC, you are treated as having an additional step of familiarity with the destination time and location. A \\\"false destination\\\" result when using this talent would be teleporting to a nonexistent location at a specific point in time, such as a mythical city that does not exist. This talent is otherwise modified normally by Warp sphere talents. For example, possessing Mass Teleport allows you to teleport to a point in time with other creatures. Note:  Time travel is complex. For example, a caster who interacts with the past and returns to their own time may not return to their own original timeline, but instead a parallel universe branching from actions and changes which occurred when the caster interacts with the past.

Your extradimensional shadow combines the weight limit of the two talents into a single progression (15 pounds per caster level, or 30 pounds per caster if you have invested two talents in Extradimensional Storage) and you may store and withdraw items in it using any action options either talent allows. Objects in your extradimensional shadow cannot be affected by creatures with Shadow Stash, and they do not become unavailable if your shadow is stolen: a flickering portal in the shape of your shadow remains, allowing you to access items regardless. If you have invested two talents in Shadow Stash, your shadow may don items even if they are not your size, stretching and warping to fit into them. You must still have the appropriate body slot for the item. You may treat your extradimensional shadow as either talent for all purposes. Among other uses, this allows you to apply the effects of feats like Stasis Storage or World In Miniature to it, which often distort the appearance of your shadow. Whenever it would be necessary to determine whether it is a Dark (shadow) effect or a Warp (space) effect (such as calculating its caster level or how it would be affected by Light), the caster may treat it as whichever they deem most advantageous to them.\"\n",

This rift deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage damage to all creatures within 5 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels radius each round for 1 round per caster level and attempts a bullrush check against them as the Air Blast talent of the Destruction sphere. \\n \\n \\n 55 \\n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \\n \\n \\n 56 \\n (Combat) All squares out to close range of the caster stretch, requiring any creature moving through them to spend two squares of movement each and preventing 5-foot steps. \\n \\n \\n 57 \\n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \\n \\n \\n 58 \\n A rift opens adjacent to the caster, opening to the elemental plane of fire. This rift deals 1d6 fire damage to all creatures within 5 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels radius each round for 1 round per caster level. \\n \\n \\n 59 \\n Any items in the caster's hands teleport 1d6 squares in a random direction. \\n \\n \\n 60 \\n The caster makes a single magical skill check against all Warp sphere effects within medium range to dispel them as if using the Counterspell feat. This is resolved before the triggering effect. \\n \\n \\n 61 \\n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \\n \\n \\n 62 \\n The caster may teleport within medium range as a free action. \\n \\n \\n 63 \\n The caster may teleport within medium range as a free action, but is dazed for 1 round if he does so.

If that space is occupied, the caster is shunted to the nearest open space. \\n \\n \\n 66 \\n (Combat) All squares out to close range of the caster stretch, requiring any allied creature moving through them to spend two squares of movement each and preventing 5-foot steps. \\n \\n \\n 67 \\n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster gain the ability to complete their normal movements without passing through any intervening squares. \\n \\n \\n 68 \\n (Combat) The nearest allied creature not adjacent to the caster is teleported adjacent to the caster. \\n \\n \\n 69 \\n The caster takes 1d4 Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \\n \\n \\n 70 \\n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Will save or be shunted to an empty demiplane for 1d6 rounds. This demiplane has planar traits as chosen by the caster. \\n \\n \\n 71 \\n Any hostile creatures that threaten an affected creature may choose to be teleported along with or enter the extradimensional space alongside the target.

      "            \"benefits\": \"Precipitation has the most severe interaction with the other weather categories, as the conditions change depending on the temperature and wind. When combined with Cold severity 4 or higher, snow effects are added to rain effects. When combined with Wind severity 4 or higher, storm effects are added to the rain effects. When combined with both Cold severity 4 and Wind severity 4, this results in rain, snow, and storm effects. Mist and fog are the exceptions to this, as they only appear when rain is not combined with either snow nor storm. Severity of the snow or storm effects depends on the severity of the Precipitation, not the severity of the Wind or Cold. Note:  While water freezes at Cold severity 3, magic cannot cause rain to instantly become snow as it falls until severity level 4, since the magical water/cold is only augmenting the natural process, not replacing it.

Fog:  The caster may create light rain or fog. If fog is chosen, it obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment. Other rain effects:  Beginning at severity level 4, rain has the same effect on fires, ranged attacks, and Perception checks as wind of equal severity level. This does not stack with the penalties provided by wind. The rain also cuts visibility ranges by half, resulting in an additional \\u20134 penalty on Perception checks due to poor visibility. It rains about 1 inch per hour at severity 4, 2 inches per hour at severity level 5, 5 inches per hour at severity level 6, and 10 inches per hour at severity level 7. Snow Effects \\nSnow causes squares to count as difficult terrain. This requires 24 hours of snow at severity level 1, 8 hours at severity level 2, 1 hour at severity level 3, and happens immediately at severity level 4. At severity level 5, snow obscures vision as fog does. It costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow (about 2 feet). This requires 24 hours at severity level 4, 8 hours at severity level 5, 1 hour at severity level 6, and happens immediately at severity level 7. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds might also result in snowdrifts 1d4 \\u00d7 5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind\\u2014a cabin or a large tent, for instance. Storm Effects \\nBeginning at severity level 4, storms will randomly strike a square with lightning, dealing 4d8 electricity damage (Reflex half) to everything in or above that square. This happens once per minute. This damage increases by 2d8 for every severity level above 4, to a maximum of 10d8 at severity level 7.\"\n",

      "            \"benefits\": \"As Heat is the opposite of Cold, Aridity is the opposite of Precipitation. If the Precipitation is lowered below step 1 of Precipitation, it becomes step 2 of Aridity. If the Aridity is lowered below step 1 of Aridity, it becomes step 2 of Precipitation. Water left in open air loses about an inch of height per day for every level of combined severity between Heat and Aridity This becomes 2 inches per combined level at Aridity severity level 6, and 4 inches per combined level for Aridity severity level 7. In normal conditions, a character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his Constitution score. After this time, the character must succeed at a Constitution check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Characters that take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to their total hit points begin to take lethal damage instead. Beginning at severity level 2, all creatures suffer a penalty equal to the Aridity severity level to all saving throws against effects that would cause fatigue or exhaustion, as well as to saving throws made against thirst. At Aridity severity level 3 creatures must drink twice as much water per day to stay healthy. At severity level 4, the amount of time a character can go without water before they must begin attempting checks, as well as the time between checks, is cut in half (12 + 1/2 Constitution modifier hours, checks every 30 minutes). This time is cut in half again for each severity level above 4. Even if they are drinking enough water, targets in areas of extreme magically-enhanced aridity still suffer terrible effects as the water in their bodies is constantly sucked up by the environment around them. Targets in areas of high aridity suffer the same chance of suffering nonlethal damage (from desiccation) and suffering fatigue (but not fire damage) as if they were in Heat of the same severity level. This does not stack with the penalties provided by Heat or Cold. However, if combined with Wind or Heat of severity level 4 or higher, the combined effects drain the energy from all living creatures, rendering them sickened for as long as they are within this environment. Characters who have taken nonlethal damage due to desiccation or from a lack of food or water are fatigued. Nonlethal damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as needed, or until they receive magical healing.

      "            \"benefits\": \"While control weather deals in manipulating large weather patterns, a shroud is an expression of extremely localized weather, usually only large enough to effect a single target. You may activate a (shroud) talent as a standard action, placing that shroud on a single creature within your control weather range. Placing a shroud on a target is subject to spell resistance, but a target does not get a saving throw to resist the application of a shroud. Shroud effects persist as long as the caster concentrates. The caster may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow the effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without the need for concentration. Unlike control weather, shrouds produce no lasting effects; any rain evaporates immediately, ice disappears when it leaves the target, etc. Shrouds do not counter the prevailing effects of the local weather (for example, Karakaze does not protect against the effects of Heat), but are also not affected by them (for example, Glare functions even in complete darkness and Heat Stroke works even in arctic levels of Cold). When a creature is affected by two or more shrouds of the same weather type (such as Aridity or Heat) or is affected by a shroud and is in an area of the shroud's weather type of severity level 3 or above, it suffers an additional effect depending on the shroud's type. If a shroud has more than one weather type, it can trigger the added effect of any of its types. Regardless of the number of shrouds affecting a target, any additional effect only affects them once per round. The saving throw DC and the caster level for any additional effect are equal to that of the shroud affecting them. If a target is affected by multiple shrouds with different DCs and caster levels, use the highest DC and caster level for the additional effect (even if the highest caster level and highest DC are from different shrouds). Shroud Additional Effects Aridity:  The target takes a -4 penalty to its Constitution score, which may not reduce its Constitution score below 1. It may attempt a Fortitude save (at its unpenalized Fortitude save bonus) at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round. Cold:  The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls, concentration checks, and AC. It may attempt a Will save at the beginning of each turn to ignore this penalty for one round. Fallout:  The target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every 5 caster levels you possess. Heat:  The target takes a -4 penalty to its Strength score, which may not reduce its Strength score below 1. It may attempt a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round. Precipitation:  Each round at the beginning of its turn the target must succeed at a Reflex save or treat the square it starts in as difficult terrain. They also take a -4 penalty to Acrobatics and Climb checks, and to CMB and CMD. Wind:  Each round at the beginning of its turn the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be moved 1d6 x 5 feet in a random direction. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. If the target cannot move this far (such as if a wall or other creature is in the way) it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet not traveled (minimum 1d6) and falls prone. Weather Talents\"\n",

GM Advice This advice is from The Tempestarian's Handbook The Power of Weather \\nIn many ways, the base Weather sphere abilities to control weather are effects for utility first instead of combat. With nothing but the base weather sphere, a caster could summon fog or rain to cover the party during stealth, or use winds to keep the arrows of a distant enemy away. Heat and cold can be managed during long travel to avoid the pitfalls of extreme environments, or to aid a settlement in times of drought or winter. However, focused weather experts can sometimes find that weather is one of the trickier spheres to play with, both as a GM and as a player. First, it takes significant time to change the weather, meaning by the time you bring the wind or rain or heat to a severity where it will actually make a difference in combat, the battle may be over. Second, because it covers a wide area, only affects creatures while they are in the area, and is indiscriminate in who it affects, weather often hinders a tempestarian's allies as much as their enemies. This handbook has tried to offer several tools to lessen these difficulties. Shrouds, as well as the Dehydration Pulse and Rain Bomb advanced talents help allow a Tempestarian to affect the course of a battle almost immediately. Shrouds also give the Tempestarian the ability to selectively target enemies and spare their friends, while Mantles make affecting allies with control weather a boon. Many tempestarians will thus find useful tools in this handbook, even if they prefer to stick to a more traditional strategy of changing the environment of the entire battlefield. The challenges facing a GM when either a PC or an NPC uses the Weather sphere are deeper and more intractable. The same difficulties facing PCs can face NPCs, and so NPC tempestarians might be wise to pick some of the new talents available to them, though a canny DM with an intelligent NPC can get around these problems by careful encounter design. Some monsters are immune to the effects of weather, and some have other ways to avoid it. Bulettes, for example, burrow underground and are unaffected by weather while protected by a layer of earth, so a caster above ground might pummel the PCs with hail while bulettes pop up, attack, and disappear beneath the earth again. The greater challenge comes from the sheer force available to tempestarians. With the right talents, they can batter entire battlefields with damage and control the conditions of a fight. While the individual damage done by Weather pales in comparison to the Destruction sphere, it is continuous and widespread. They can easily level structures and even entire settlements, and can do so from an early level. To address this problem, this handbook has changed certain talents\\u2014Boiling Lord, Cold Lord, Heat Lord, Rain Lord, and Wind Lord\\u2014to be advanced magic. While GMs and groups of course have always had the prerogative to restrict the use of these talents if disruptive to play, this change encourages them to consider their power and reinforces the fact that the impact of weather needs to be considered carefully in a game where such game-altering power isn't easily available to PCs. In addition, GMs are strongly encouraged to remember how structures are affected by weather. In addition to the lightning rod and storm shelter (provided both for GMs and for players wishing to construct weather-resistant strongholds), structures built of hard materials such as stone are virtually impervious to damage from weather; objects take half damage from energy attacks before applying hardness, which when combined with the sheer number of hit points most structures possess, makes destroying them with weather an extremely difficult task.\"\n",
