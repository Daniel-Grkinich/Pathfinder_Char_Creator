    "blank transformation": {
      "benefits": "When a creature gains the Alteration sphere, they gain the ability to grant the Blank Transformation. Unlike other transformations, the Blank Transformation does not change the creature's basic makeup. They do not gain the +10 bonus to Disguise checks, nor do they lose their abilities, equipment, natural attacks, or any other aspect of their unaltered form. The Blank Transformation allows a caster to add traits to a creature without fundamentally changing the target first. As a trait, you may change the target's cosmetic appearance. This could include changing the target's apparent age, making an elf into an orc, adding a purely cosmetic tail, disguising a large dog as a small pony, changing a male into a female, or some other such alteration. This grants the target a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. This trait may only be applied to the Blank Transformation, as such changes are assumed with other forms. Note: Legs Creatures without legs are immune to being tripped. Creatures with 4 or more legs gain a +4 bonus to their CMD vs. trip for each pair of legs beyond the first, and are treated as quadrupeds for the purpose of their carrying capacity. Creature Types and Alteration Talents While assuming a creature's form with the Alteration sphere generally does not cause the transformed creature to change their creature type or subtype, sometimes various abilities require correlating creature types and subtypes to their respective talents. The table below connects various creature types to the appropriate talent. In the case of the animal and magical beast types, general descriptions of their forms are used to better match the available talents. Note that there may be specific cases where an unusual creature fits poorly with the form granted by the talent corresponding to its type. In these cases it is up to the GM to discern the most suitable talent.

      "benefits": "You may apply the following traits to any form. You may grant each trait multiple times. One extra arm . This arm does not come with any natural attacks nor provide additional attacks, but otherwise are as strong and capable as the creature's other arms. If the base creature or form has no arms, this trait grants two arms the first time it is gained. Two secondary arms . These arms do not come with any natural attacks nor provide additional attacks. Secondary arms may hold objects, but are not strong enough to be used to hold shields or make attacks, nor possess the dexterity needed to fulfill somatic requirements. Secondary arms do not count as arms or hands for the purposes of traits (or similar effects or abilities) which require arms or hands. A prehensile tail , which may be used to hold objects as if it were a hand, and retrieve objects from a belt or pouch as a swift action. Tail slap natural weapon  (secondary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, requires tail) Stinger natural weapon  (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small, requires tail) A pair of legs.  This grants a 20 feet land speed if the target did not possess one. If this is not the form's first pair of legs, the target gains a +4 CMD bonus against trip attempts. If this causes the target to become a quadruped, they gain the related increase to carrying capacity and may serve as a mount for creatures smaller than itself. An extra head.  This extra head does not possess its own personality nor natural attacks. For each extra head granted, the target gains one of the following benefits, chosen by the caster: The target gains a +1 bonus to all skill checks. \n The target may treat a two-handed or one-handed weapon as a light weapon for the purpose of two-weapon fighting penalties. \n The target cannot be flanked. \n The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects, and gains a new save against such effects 1 round later at the same DC to throw off the effect. If the target possesses a similar ability already, it may only use one reroll per round per effect."

    "agile": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following traits to your forms: Dodge:  The target gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC. Evasion:  The target gains incredible reflexes. When the target succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage. This ability does not function when wearing medium or heavy armor. Initiative:  The target gains quickened reactions, granting a +4 competence bonus to initiative. Uncanny Dodge:  The target gains extraordinary reactions, granting uncanny dodge as the rogue ability. The target is no longer flat-footed at the start of combat nor loses Dexterity to AC against invisible attackers. If the target is granted this trait a second time or already has the uncanny dodge ability from another source, they instead gain improved uncanny dodge as the rogue ability. The target can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the target by flanking, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has Hit Dice."

As a full-round action, the target may make a single attack action at double its normal reach with that natural weapon with a +4 bonus to its attack roll. Leaping Attack:  As a standard action, the target may jump, making a single attack action at any point during the leap. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity for leaving a threatened square. Pounce:  The target may make a full-attack after a charge. Granting this trait costs an additional spell point. Trample:  As a full-round action, the target may move up to its move speed, moving over and dealing slam damage (1d6 + 1-1/2 Strength modifier Medium, 1d4 + 1-1/2 Strength modifier Small) to any creatures smaller than itself. Creatures affected by the trample can make an attack of opportunity, but at a \u20134 penalty. If they forgo an attack of opportunity, they may attempt to avoid the target, attempting a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Str modifier).

The target becomes immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled poison), can survive underwater, or even in a vacuum (though does not provide protection from extreme cold or other conditions that may be encountered in such an environment).

Granting this trait costs an additional spell point. \n Endure Weather:  The target suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment and can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (-45 and 60 degrees Celsius) without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected.

    "giant traits": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following traits to your forms: Giant Fortitude:  The target gains the hearty toughness of giants. The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level and a bonus on Fortitude saving throws equal to 1 +1 per 10 caster levels. If the target does not take damage for one minute, the temporary hit points replenish. These temporary hit points are lost if the shapeshift ends or if the target loses this trait. [SA:EAO] Rock Catching:  Once per round the creature can catch a rock (or projectile of a similar shape) up to its size that it would normally be hit by. The creature must succeed at a Reflex save against a DC of 15 for a Small or smaller rock, +5 per size increase.

You must spend a spell point to make the shapeshift endure without concentration. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."

    "lingering transformation": {
      "benefits": "Your shapeshift effects linger for 2 additional rounds after you stop concentrating.

      "benefits": "When bestowing a shapeshift, you may spend an additional spell point to shapeshift an additional 1 creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) at the same time.

    "mimicry": {
      "benefits": "You may study a creature you can see as a full-round action or spend a spell point to instead study it as a swift action. For the next hour or until you study another creature, you gain a single Alteration talent corresponding to the creature or one of the creature's apparent features.

    "morphic weapon": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following traits to your forms: Shape Weapon:  Choose one limb capable of wielding a weapon. You may transform this limb into a weapon the target creature is proficient with. This weapon cannot be disarmed and gains an enhancement bonus equal to 1/4 of your caster level (min 0). Ranged weapons produced this way do not come with ammunition. A two-handed weapon still requires an additional limb to wield. This weapon is treated as a manufactured weapon with hardness equal to your caster level. Treat the weapon as having its own hp, normal for a weapon of its type, for purposes of effects that would damage or sunder it. If this weapon has the broken condition when the shapeshift ends, any attacks or skill checks made with the corresponding limb take a -2 penalty to attack rolls for 24 hrs. A DC 15 heal check or magical healing equal to the hit points the weapon possessed remove this penalty. \n Graft Weapon:  Choose one limb capable of wielding a weapon that is holding a weapon that can be used in one hand. You may graft the weapon held by this limb into the limb itself. A grafted weapon cannot be disarmed and may be treated as a primary natural weapon.

    "odiferous": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following additional traits to your forms: Nauseating Spray:  Once per minute, as a standard action the target may spray noxious chemicals in a 15 ft. cone. Any creature in this cone must make a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 HD + Constitution modifier or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. If you spend an additional spell point when granting this trait, the affected creatures are nauseated for 1d6 rounds on a failed save and sickened for 1 round on a successful save. The size of the cone increases by 5 ft. per 5 caster levels. This counts as a poison effect. \n Inured:  The target gains a +2 competence bonus on any save to resist the sickened and nauseated conditions and against poison effects. This bonus increases by +1 per 4 caster levels. \n Stench:  The target secretes a stinking chemical offensive to most living things.

    },
    "perfect imitation": {
      "benefits": "Your Alteration sphere abilities allow targets to imitate individual creatures with which you are familiar. The +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks provided by the Alteration sphere applies to Disguise checks to appear as that specific individual. This bonus does not stack with the bonus to Disguise checks from similar effects (the disguise self spell, illusionary disguise talent of the Illusion sphere, the Realistic Likeness ARG  feat, etc.). Your control is detailed and specific enough to allow you to merge your clothing and armor with your body and replicate the appearance of other clothes, armor, and even jewelry. Such articles cannot be removed from the creature's possession as they are formed from the target's body. As usual, merged armor provides no AC and any merged equipment cannot be accessed. Additionally, the option to alter a target's cosmetic appearance with Blank Form no longer requires a trait if not assuming the guise of a specific individual. You may add the following traits to your forms: Camouflage:  Your target may shift its coloration to mimic its environment, granting a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks."
    },
    "powerful limbs": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following traits to your form: Powerful Arms:  Choose one pair of limbs the target possesses capable of wielding a weapon. With these limbs, you may wield weapons of one size larger without penalty. This does not stack with other effects that allow you to wield larger weapons without penalty, such as powerful build. Additionally, the target increases its overhead lifting capacity by 50%. \n Powerful Claws:  Choose one natural attack the target possesses (or pair of natural attacks if granted in pairs such as claws, talons, pincers, etc.). The selected attack or attacks deals damage as if it were one size larger. This size increase stacks with other effects that increase actual and effective size, such as the Size Change Alteration sphere talent or the Encompassing Light talent of the  Light  sphere. \n Powerful Legs:  The target is always considered to have a running start when making Acrobatics checks to jump and treat its move speed as if it were 10 ft. plus 5 ft. per 5 caster levels higher when determining the bonus or penalty to jump checks from movement speed. Additionally, the target's carrying capacity is increased by 50%."

      "benefits": "As a trait, you may change a creature's size. You may enlarge or reduce a creature's size by one category, +1 additional size category per 5 caster levels, enlarging or reducing the size of their equipment as well. You cannot enlarge beyond Large size nor reduce beyond Tiny size until caster level 10, and can never enlarge beyond Huge nor reduce beyond Diminutive. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and to AC, as well as a +2 bonus to Fly checks and a +4 bonus to Stealth checks for every size category they are reduced, and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls and AC, as well as a -2 penalty to Fly checks and a -4 to Stealth checks for every size category they are enlarged. (These numbers are doubled when moving to or from Diminutive size.) Ability scores are also adjusted according to the target's new size; the target gains a +2 bonus to Strength and suffers a -2 penalty to Dexterity for every size increase, and a -2 penalty to Strength and a +2 bonus to Dexterity for every size category decrease.

    "steal shape [3pp]": {
      "benefits": "Source:  Expanded Spheres: Baron's Lost Apocrypha Whenever you successfully hit a creature with at least half as many Hit Dice as your character level with an attack that requires an attack roll, you may spend an additional spell point to use a shapeshift as a swift action on any creature within range. If the attack was a critical hit, knocked the target creature unconscious, or reduced the enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you may use the shapeshift without spending the additional spell point required to use this talent. In either case, you must use the shapeshift to transform the target in such a way that it resembles the creature that was attacked (such as by making the target resemble the attacked creature or giving it traits analogous to the abilities of the attacked creature)."
    },
    "swarm shape": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following traits to your forms: Divided Self:  The target gains a +4 bonus on saves against effects that target individual creatures. (Requires the Swarm trait) Gaseous Body:  You grant the target the ability to shift into or out of a gas-like form (e.g. fine mist, a cloud of insects, etc.) as a move action. While in this gas-like form, the target gains a fly speed of 10 feet with maneuverability (perfect), +5 feet per 5 caster levels, replacing all other movement the target may possess. Anything the target was wearing or holding transforms with the target, and the target loses its armor and natural armor bonuses. The target cannot manipulate or interact with objects, make attacks, speak, or cast spells with verbal, somatic, or focus components (unless the target possesses an ability to do so, such as the Silent Spell metamagic feat). Any traits or supernatural abilities the target possesses which alter or require its physical body are suppressed, including Alteration sphere traits. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even cracks. The target is still subject to the effects of wind and cannot enter water or other liquid. Granting this trait costs an additional spell point. [Gravecaller's HB] Swarm:  You may spend a spell point to turn the target into a swarm of creatures. The swarm can be composed only of Tiny creatures, with appearance and movement per the shapeshift. This size cannot be altered by the Size Change trait, enlarge person, or other effects. This does not affect the target's movement modes. The target can move through small holes and openings that are large enough for the individual creatures. The swarm fills a 10-foot square (or cube if flying) and has a reach of 0. The target gains a 25% ability to ignore critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5 caster levels to a maximum of 100%. The swarm has the distraction ability, forcing any creature that takes swarm damage to succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier or be nauseated for 1 round. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a magical skill check (DC 20 + 1/2 caster level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration while in the swarm requires a DC 20 Will save. The target may choose to ignore any creatures in its space, choosing to not deal the swarm damage, force magical skill checks to cast spells, or force Will saves to skills. The swarm form is incapable of performing combat maneuvers and they cannot be bull rushed, dragged, grappled, repositioned, or tripped. Creatures in swarm form take 50% more damage from effects that affect an area. Creatures in swarm form do not threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. The swarm automatically deals 1d6 + Constitution modifier damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its turn. This damage increases by 1d6 per 5 caster levels and may be modified by traits that require a natural attack (such as the Poison trait from the Vermin Transformation talent) but not those that modify natural attacks (such as the Powerful Claws trait from the Powerful Limbs talent). A creature that retains a natural attack (such as a shifter via a bestial trait) or is granted a natural attack by another trait cannot use it, but uses d8 for its swarm damage. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover."

    "aberrant body (body)": {
      "benefits": "You may add the following traits to your forms: Acid Spit:  As a standard action, the target may launch a glob of acid as a ranged touch attack out to close range, dealing 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels, +1 damage per d6 for a number of additional rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Spending a move action removing the acid stops the additional damage. Gibbering:  All creatures within 30 feet of the target take a -2 penalty on concentration checks. This penalty increases by 1 per 5 caster levels. Many Eyes:  The target cannot be flanked. Mucus:  The target gains the ability to release a mucus cloud as a standard action, with a radius of 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels that persists for 1 round per caster level unless dispersed by a strong wind. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that comes in contact with the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier or become unable to breathe air but can breathe underwater for 1 round per caster level or until they spend a standard action removing the mucus. A creature unable to breathe air that remains out of water begins to suffocate. Roper Strands:  The target gains a roper strand. This trait may be granted multiple times, granting an additional roper strand per additional trait. As a standard action, (or full-round action if using multiple strands), the target may launch their strands, making one ranged touch attack per strand at a target within close range. Each strands clings to the target, causing 1 Strength damage each round they remain attached (increasing by 1 die size per 5 caster levels; i.e. 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). A Fortitude save (10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier) negates this damage for the round. A creature cannot be affected more than once per round. Strands have 1 hit point, and hardness equal to the effect's caster level, and a Break DC, Escape Artist DC, and AC equal to 10 + the effect's caster level. However, strands are instantly severed by any slashing damage, which bypasses its hardness automatically. Creatures connected by roper strands may not move away from each other, though may choose to move closer or laterally. Moving farther requires severing the strand with an attack, breaking it with a Strength check, or removing it with an Escape Artist check, or succeeding on a drag combat maneuver against the target they are connected to. When two targets are connected by a strand, they may attempt drag combat maneuver checks against each other at range without provoking attacks of opportunity. If a strand is broken, the target instantly regrows the strand, and may still make strand attacks."

The target gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to 1/4th their Hit Dice, rounded down. Spirit's Reach:  The target's limbs become able to project themselves further than their physical confines. When making an attack action using a natural weapon, delivering a touch attack, performing skill checks, or manipulating objects (such as picking up unattended objects, throwing switches, or dropping objects), the target's reach increases by 5 feet + 5 feet for every 10 caster levels you possess. The target does not threaten this area. Shadow Blend:  At 5th caster level, you may make the target murky, giving it concealment (20% miss chance) even when in normal light. This does not work in bright light. Spiritual Touch:  At 6th caster level, you may cause the target's weapons and natural weapons to all be treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.

If the target's Intelligence is lower than 6 (including 0), it is increased to 6. If the target is normally immune to mind-altering effects due to not possessing a mind, this negates that immunity. If you so choose, you may forgo applying additional traits to the target. Instead, you may allow the target to retain its natural attacks, special abilities, and movement types that were dependent on its previous form, in essence making the target a hybrid between a humanoid and its previous form. If this form is being applied to a creature that is already an intelligent humanoid or a creature of a similar makeup, this instead works as the Blank Transformation, but the creature may undergo cosmetic changes without costing a trait. Additionally, you may choose up to two traits from Blank Transformation and/or a single (transformation) or (body) talent that you possess that do not grant natural attacks and apply them to the target, as if it were part of this form.

If the target can breathe air normally, it also gains the amphibious special ability, and can breathe both water and air. Aquan Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Amphibious:  The shapeshifted target gains a swim speed as that granted by Aquan Transformation. In addition, the target gains the aquatic subtype and amphibious special quality, allowing the target to breathe both water and air. \n Aquatic Tail:  The shapeshifted target gains a tail and a circumstance bonus on Swim checks equal to +1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, the shapeshifted target may use this tail to create a sudden riptide while underwater. As a standard action the shapeshifted target can create a 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels cone. Creatures in the cone's area take 2d6 + 1d6 per 5 caster levels nonlethal bludgeoning damage and are pushed 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels directly away from the shapeshifted target (Reflex negates; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC plus the circumstance bonus on Swim checks granted by this trait).

If you do, the shapeshifted target's base land speed is reduced to 5 feet and the target cannot be tripped. In addition, the shapeshifted target gains a 30 feet swim speed or increases their existing swim speed by +15 feet (whichever is more beneficial). If the shapeshifted target gains legs through another ability or Alteration sphere trait, such as the Additional Limbs \"a pair of legs\" trait, the shapeshifted target loses any benefits or adjustments from replacing their legs with this tail. \n Blindsense  30 feet (only in water) \n Ink Jet:  Once per minute, the target may shoot a jet of ink as a standard action. In water, this creates a 10-foot radius sphere that provides total concealment and persists for 1 minute. On land, this is a ranged touch attack with a 10-foot range increment and a maximum range of 50 feet that forces a struck creature to succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier) or be blinded for 1d6 rounds or until they spend a standard action removing the ink from their eyes. \n Jet:  The target can swim backwards as a full-round action at four times their swim speed. It must move in a straight line while jetting, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it does so. This trait requires a swim speed. \n Keen Scent:  The target gains the keen scent universal monster ability. \n Shock:  As a standard action, the target may deal 1d8 + 1d8 per odd caster level electricity damage with a melee touch attack. This touch attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If a creature successfully grapples the target, the target may use this ability as an immediate action, inflicting the damage with no attack roll, but allowing a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. If the target is in water, this ability instead functions as a 10-foot radius burst centered on the target; affected creatures are allowed a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Creatures beyond 10 feet but within a 30-foot radius takes half damage, with a Fortitude save for half damage. Once used, this ability cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds."

Unless a creature succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier), the acid damage affects any clothing and non-metal armor a creature is wearing on a successful attack, and also damages any wooden weapon that successfully attacks the jelly. This damage bypasses the material's hardness. The target also gains a resistance to electricity equal to the effect's caster level. \n Pudding:  The target's acid damage only affects organic material and not stone or metal, and deals damage to clothing, armor, and wooden weapons as described under jellies above. Additionally, the target gains a climb speed of 20 feet, and the ability to suction. Activating or deactivating suction is a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed, but may climb any surface with ease, even inverted ones. Suction also grants a +10 circumstance bonus to CMD vs. bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that would physically move the target. Ooze Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Acidic Body:  The target's body is dangerous to the touch. The target's unarmed strikes or one slam attack (if it possesses one) deals +1d4 acid damage, as detailed above under the Ooze Transformation. If the target already possesses this acid damage, such as through the Ooze Transformation, the damage instead increases by one size category (two die sizes). \n Acidic Nature:  The target must possess a slime's acid damage, either through the Ooze Transformation or the acidic body trait, to gain this trait. The target's acid only affects organic material and not stone or metal, and damages clothing and wood, as detailed under jellies above. If the target already possess this ability, such as through the jelly or pudding packages above, its acid now affects metal and can dissolve metal armor and metal weapons in addition to wood and cloth. \n Engulf:  The target must possess the form from Ooze Transformation, or else the fluid body trait, to gain this trait. As a standard action, the target may move up to its speed and attempt to engulf anything in its path. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs. The creature merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Strength modifier) to avoid being engulfed - on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the creature's body until they are no longer pinned, and take acid damage from the target each round if it possesses either the Ooze Transformation or the acidic body trait. An engulfed creature may attempt to escape as if escaping a pin. \n Fluid Body:  The target can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing."

    "orb transformation (transformation)": {
      "benefits": "You may grant the form of a floating sphere, helmet, or similar shape with your shapeshift. \n Limbs:  none \n Speech:  Yes;  Hands:  No \n Speed:  5 ft. land speed, 30 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster levels float as the Float trait. At caster level 7, this speed becomes a fly speed with maneuverability (perfect). This levitation and flight is a supernatural ability. \n Natural weapons:  slam (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small) \n AC:  +2 dodge bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels \n Special:  May benefit from traits requiring a head as if it had one and may not be tripped or beheaded (such as by a vorpal weapon) unless gaining legs or a head, respectively, from another source. A creature in the form of an orb counts as one size smaller for the purposes of stealth and squeezing into small places. Orb Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Aura of Fascination:  The target projects a 30-foot aura that fascinates creatures which are near it. Such creatures must succeed at a Will save or be fascinated for as long as they remain in the aura. A creature that makes its save is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The target may choose to suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This ability ceases to function if the target is stunned, paralyzed, unconscious, dead, or otherwise incapacitated. This is a mind-affecting effect. \n Beam:  The target can fire a ray as a standard action. This ray is a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 30 feet and deals 1d6 damage + 1d6 per 3 caster levels. The ray's damage is untyped and overcomes damage reduction of any type, though hardness still applies. At 10th caster level, and every 10 caster levels thereafter, the ray's maximum range increases by 30 feet. If you spend an additional spell point when granting this trait, the target can charge the ray as a full-round action. At any time after the ray is charged, the target can fire it as a standard action as a 100 feet line, dealing 1d6 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6) plus an additional amount of fire damage equal to twice your caster level (Reflex half; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). Firing the charged ray discharges it, and it must be charged to be fired in this manner again. [SA:EAO] \n Float:  The target may float up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels above the ground, moving at 30 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. When falling the target may choose to descend at a slower rate to control its fall and to negate all falling damage it would take. Each round it descends 30 feet, and may move in another direction for 30 feet. It may choose to drift sideways, gliding forwards while descending, or down, safely increasing its rate of descent. It may even choose to drift 'upwards' to reduce its rate of descent, even allowing it to negate it entirely and hover midair."

The target is considered to have the plant creature type (in addition to their other creature types) for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons). Plant Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Barkskin:  You may grant the target a +2 natural armor bonus, which stacks with other sources of natural armor. \n Pollen:  As a swift action, the target can release a cloud of pollen with a radius up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels centered on the target which persists until the start of the target's next turn. Creatures other than the target who begin their turn or enter the cloud of pollen are staggered for one round (Fortitude negates; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The pollen trait's effects are a poison effect; bonuses or immunities against inhaled effects function against this trait's effects. [SA:EAO] \n Rigid Body:  You may grant the target a +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels, which does not stack with other sources of natural armor. \n Sporepod:  Once per minute as a standard action, the target can launch a sporepod. Treat this as a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. While a direct hit deals no damage, any creature within 10 + 5 feet per 5 caster levels from the sporepod's point of contact is confused for 1+1d6 rounds (Will partial; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). A creature that succeeds at its save is sickened for 1 round instead. The sporepod is a mind-affecting poison effect. This trait costs an additional spell point. [SA:EAO] \n Strong Roots:  The target gains a bonus to CMD equal to 2 + 1 per 10 caster levels against bull rush, drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers or other effects which would attempt to knock the target prone or forcibly move them. This bonus doubles if the target starts and ends his turn in the same space. \n Thorn Spray:  As a standard action, the target can spray a volley of thorns dealing 1d4 piercing per 2 caster levels damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone or 15-foot radius burst centered on the target (Reflex half; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). The target must wait at least 1d4 rounds between uses of this ability. Creatures who fail their save against this ability have thorns embedded in their body, taking a -2 penalty on Reflex saves and Dexterity-based skill checks. These penalties increase by 1 per 5 caster levels. Creatures may spend a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity to remove these thorns. [SA:EAO]"

    "serpentine transformation (transformation)": {

In addition, the target gains one of the following packages depending on which serpent is being mimicked: Constrictor:  The target gains the grab universal monster ability attached to its bite natural attack, as well the constrict special attack (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, + Strength modifier). The target gains the normal +4 bonus on checks made to start and maintain a grapple from the grab ability, but this bonus increases by 1 per 5 caster levels. \n Poisonous:  When the target makes a successful bite attack, it automatically attempt to poison its target (save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save). Serpentine Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Death Roll:  Whenever you maintain a grapple and choose to deal damage to the target with a natural attack, you may attempt a second grapple combat maneuver check as a free action. If successful, the grappled creature is knocked prone. This additional grapple check does not count as maintaining the grapple and does not add any other effects on a successful grapple (such as constrict). \n Serpentine Tail:  The shapeshifted target gains a tail and a circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to +1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, the shapeshifted target may use this tail to perform trip combat maneuvers within their natural reach, gaining a bonus on trip combat maneuvers made this way equal to 1/2 the circumstance bonus granted to Acrobatics checks from this talent (minimum 1). If you gain the ability to use this tail with a tail slap natural attack, attacks made with this tail gain the trip universal monster ability.  Special:  When granting this trait, you may choose to have this tail replace the shapeshifted target's legs. If you do, the shapeshifted target's base land speed is reduced by 10 (to a minimum of 5 feet) and the target cannot be tripped. If the shapeshifted target gains legs through another ability or Alteration sphere trait, such as the Additional Limbs \"a pair of legs\" trait, the shapeshifted target loses any benefits or adjustments from replacing their legs with this tail. \n Strangle:  An opponent grappled by the target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. \n Swallow Whole:  The target gains the swallow whole ability, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage + an additional 1d6 acid damage per 3 caster levels. The target may swallow creatures up to one size smaller than themselves. This trait may be taken twice; the second time allows the target to swallow creatures up to their own size and grants a bonus to CMB and CMD equal to 1 + 1 per 3 caster levels on grapple checks made to swallow creatures or to prevent them from escaping once swallowed. More than one creature may be swallowed at a time, but may not exceed the maximum total size that can be swallowed, counting two Tiny creatures as one Small creature, two Small creatures as one Medium creature, etc. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon, or it can just try to escape the grapple. The amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 the creature's total hit points. This damage is inflicted on the swallowing creature as normal. The AC of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the swallowing creature cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the attacker's mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again. (You must possess a bite attack with the grab ability to gain this trait.)"

Subterranean Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: A burrow speed as granted by the Subterranean form. \n Tremorsense 20 feet. \n Armor Shredder:  Choose one natural attack the target possesses when granting this trait. Whenever the target hits an opponent with the chosen natural attack, the target may attempt a free sunder combat maneuver attempt against one object worn or held by the opponent (e.g. armor, shield, belt) using the original attack roll as their combat maneuver check (Reflex negates; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). The target does not provoke an attack of opportunity for a sunder combat maneuver attempted this way. If you spend an additional spell point when granting this trait, the target's chosen natural attack ignores an amount of hardness equal to your caster level when dealing damage to objects. (Requires a natural attack) [SA:EAO] \n Burrowing Charge:  The target can perform a special charge attack by burrowing. When the target charges, they may burrow as part of the charge, resurfacing at the end of their charge in any space which the target can attack the opponent. This allows the target to charge where they might otherwise be obstructed by terrain, and allows the target to end their charge in a further square than the closest square they would otherwise be required to move to. The target must still have a clear path and line of sight to the opponent to charge. When the target resurfaces as part of this special charge attack, they may choose to violently unsettle the ground as they surface before attacking. Creatures adjacent to the target fall prone (Reflex negates; DC equal to the caster's Alteration sphere DC). (Requires a burrow speed) [SA:EAO] \n Tunneling:  When traveling using its burrow speed, the target can choose to leave a tunnel that is equal to the target's size (for example, a Large creature will leave a 10-foot tall by 10-foot wide tunnel). The tunnel lasts for one minute before collapsing. (Requires a burrow speed) [SA:EAO]"

Vermin Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form: Climb:  The target gains a climb speed, as that granted by Vermin Transformation. In addition, the target does not need to attempt Climb checks to move across a vertical or horizontal surface (even if upside down).

    "fusion": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Alteration sphere (Mass Alteration), caster level 5th. You may spend a spell point to target two creatures adjacent to each other with your shapeshift and merge them together into one amalgamated body. When doing so, choose one of the creatures to be the primary creature and one to be the secondary creature. Fusion counts as a shapeshift on the secondary creature which occupies the same space as the primary creature, but a different shapeshift can be applied to the primary creature as normal. You may choose to apply a different shapeshift to the primary creature with the same action as applying the fusion, which share concentration and duration. An amalgamated body can only have one creature merged into it at a time. The new amalgamated body possesses current and maximum hit points equal to those of both creatures combined. The amalgamated body possesses the extraordinary and supernatural abilities, physical statistics, Fortitude and Reflex saves, initiative, and base attack bonus of the primary creature. The physical ability modifiers of the secondary creature are gained as bonuses to the primary creature's physical ability scores (minimum 0, increases to Constitution do not increase hit points as those have already been merged together). At the caster's discretion, the shapeshift applied to the primary creature may be a Blank Transformation, granting it the limbs beyond what the primary creature already possesses as well as the natural attacks and special abilities of the secondary creature in place of other traits. Unless also applying a (transformation) talent to the primary creature to merges its equipment, the amalgamated body gains the equipment of both creatures, but may only wear and benefit from one item per magic item slot as usual, and if both creatures were using an item that requires a slot (for example, both wearing armor), only one of those pieces of equipment can be used, with redundant equipment being merged into the amalgamated body. Both of the base creature's minds remain independent, retaining mental ability scores and Will saves and are capable of taking purely mental actions, but they act on the same initiative. While weapon and armor proficiencies are shared between the two minds, only one mind can control the amalgamated body at a time, and only the feats, skills, and talents of that mind can be accessed. At the start of their turn, if the base creatures do not agree which is to be in control, they may make opposed Will saves to take control of the body that round, but the body is staggered and takes a -4 penalty to Reflex saves and AC from the confusion. Mindless creatures are unable to contest the control of an intelligent creature but two mindless creatures will always contest each other's control when fused. Effects that allow a Will save target the mind currently controlling the body. Ongoing magical effects on the base creatures overlap. Should this ability fail to affect either target (whether by successful save, spell resistance, or other cause), the effect fails. If the amalgamated creature is killed, the effect ends and both creatures die. The appearance of the merged body is mostly determined by the dominant body, but at the caster's discretion its cosmetic appearance may include aspects of the merged creature. If either target creature is suffering the effects of a disease, poison, or ongoing spell effect, the amalgamated body immediately receives a new save at a +4 bonus unless both creatures are under the same effect. If the dominant body possesses immunity to such an effect, the effect is suspended until the fusion ends, though its duration is expended as normal. Ability damage, drain, or penalty to the physical statistics of the dominant body are retained, but those to mental ability scores continue to affect each creature individually. When this effect ends, any hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, or other such penalty incurred is split evenly between the two creatures (round up). If this damage would be sufficient to reduce either creature to death, that creature is instead reduced to 1 hit point above its death threshold and is stable, with the excess damage transferred to the other creature. If the transferred damage would kill that creature, then both creatures are reduced to 1 hit point above their death threshold and are stable. If it would reduce any ability score below 0, or 1 in the case of Constitution, or if the creature does not have that ability score (such as undead and constructs lacking a Constitution score), any excess is transferred to the other creature, to a minimum of 0, or 1 in the case of Constitution. Any spell effects, poisons, diseases, or other effects that affected the amalgamated creature continue to affect both creatures, but durations are halved and any subsequent saves are made at a +4 bonus. If the space available at the end of this effect cannot accommodate both creatures, they may make opposed Will saves. The loser is shunted to the nearest empty space, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet of solid material it passes through."

Additionally, any attempt to magically heal the target requires a magical skill check against your MSD. Regenerate Flesh:  In addition to the normal healing from the Fast Healing option of the Vitality talent, the target's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multi-headed creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. The physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.

When applying a shapeshift, you may spend 2 spell points to change your shapeshift into an instantaneous effect, permanently changing the creature into the new form. Because this is an instantaneous effect, it cannot be dispelled once placed. The target is still under the effect of a shapeshift, however, and any caster attempting to apply a new shapeshift to the target (except the original caster himself) must succeed at a magic skill check as usual; the second shapeshift replaces the first instead of adding to it. When the second shapeshift's duration expires, the first shapeshift returns. A second application of a Permanent Transformation can be used to counter the first Permanent Transformation, returning the target to its original form.

You may spend an additional spell point to add the following trait options to your forms: Impossible Geometries:  You may grant the target the appearance of impossible geometries, making its apparent and actual positions different. This grants a 2% miss chance per caster level against all attacks. The true seeing spell or True Seeing Divination sphere talent can defeat this miss chance, but any creature that looks upon the target while under the aforementioned effects must succeed at a Will save equal to your Alteration sphere DC or be staggered for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting effect). (requires caster level 10th) If you possess the Mind sphere, you may spend an additional spell point to add the following traits to your forms: Unspeakable Presence:  You may grant the target a fear aura with a 30-foot radius. Hostile creatures must attempt a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the target's Hit Dice + their Charisma modifier each round they end their turn within the aura. On a failure they become shaken until they leave the aura and 1d4 rounds after leaving it. This effect stacks with itself, shaken creatures become frightened and frightened creatures become panicked for the same duration. This is a mind-affecting effect. \n Overwhelming Mind:  You may alter the target's mind to be overwhelming in its power and alien structure. The first time a creature other than an outsider (excluding native outsiders) or aberration makes mental contact with a creature with this trait, it must succeed at a Will save equal to your Alteration DC or be stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, the creature is merely staggered for 1 round. This effect can occur whether the target initiates mental contact (such as via a demand, dream, nightmare, or sending spell, certain Mind sphere effects or spell-like abilities, or once per round merely by telepathic communication) or another creature attempts to do so (such as via detect thoughts or the Mind sphere). Once a creature is exposed to overwhelming mind, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. (requires caster level 10th) Starflight:  You may grant the target the ability to survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).

    "companion merger": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Alteration sphere (Mass Alteration); animal companion or familiar. Benefit:  You may merge your body with your adjacent animal companion or familiar. You may target your companion and yourself with a mass shapeshift, paying the normal spell point cost. The merged form counts as one creature and retains the physical form of your companion or familiar (physical statistics, natural attacks, supernatural and extraordinary abilities, movement speeds, initiative, etc.) but gains your mental ability scores, casting ability, feats, base attack bonus (if higher), and base saving throws (if higher). You may instead merge the companion or familiar with yourself, gaining the companion or familiar's natural attacks (limited by the presence of suitable limbs), supernatural and extraordinary abilities, and movement speeds. The merged body has the current and maximum hit points of either creature at your choice, increasing its current and maximum hit points by those of the other creature for the duration of the effect. You may add traits to the merged form as normal for your shapeshift. If the merged creature is killed, the effect ends and both you and your companion or familiar die. If either you or your companion is suffering the effects of a disease, poison, or ongoing spell effect, the amalgamated body immediately receives a new save at a +4 bonus unless both creatures are under the same effect. When this effect ends, any hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, or other such penalty incurred is split evenly between you (round up). If this damage would be sufficient to reduce either of you to death, that creature is instead reduced to 1 hit point above its death threshold and stabilized, and the excess damage is transferred to the other creature. If it would reduce an ability score below 0, or 1 in the case of Constitution, any excess is transferred to the other creature. Any spell effects, poisons, diseases, or other effects that affected the merged creature continue to affect both of you, but durations are halved and any subsequent saves are made at a +4 bonus. If the companion or familiar possesses immunity to an ongoing effect, the effect is suppressed until the merger ends. If the merger ends in a space too small to accommodate your body, you or your companion (your choice) is shunted to the nearest empty space, taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet of solid material passed through."

On a failed save, the weapon immediately transforms into a Small animal or a group of Tiny animals and moves a short distance away before returning to its original form in a square of your choosing within 30 feet of the target. The weapon's movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The transformed weapon will not pass through dangerous squares such as an energy wall, instead stopping in the previous square. Alternatively, you may spend a spell point as a standard action to shapeshift a manufactured weapon in the range into a hostile serpent that whips around to attack its wielder. The weapon's wielder must succeed at a Will save or the next time the weapon is used within 1 round per caster level for an attack, the damage of the attack is instead dealt to the wielder. The wielder cannot willingly reduce or deal nonlethal damage with this attack. Once the damage has been dealt, the effect is discharged.

The bonus on Disguise checks does not stack with that granted by the shapeshift ability of the Alteration sphere, a hat of disguise, the Realistic Likeness ARG  feat, or similar sources.

Archetypes Specializing in Alteration \n Apex Shifter \n The Apex Shifter is a Shifter who specializes in changing into different forms using the Alteration sphere. \n Battleshifter  [CS] \n Battleshifters are Sages who specialize in changing themselves mid-battle. \n Beast Bender  [CS] \n Beast Benders are Hunters who specialize in transforming themselves and their animal allies. \n Beastsoul Monk \n The Beastsoul Monk is an archetype for the Monk that focuses on a more primal transformation style. While not actually a caster, they gain the Transformation feat, the ability to flurry with natural attacks, and the ability to use their ki to power their transformations. It is compatible with both the standard and unchained versions of the Monk. \n Champion of the Cause  [CS] \n Champions of the Cause are Paladins who can gain powerful, unique bonds or transformations. \n Experimentalist \n The Experimentalist is an archetype for the Thaumaturge that focuses on creating alchemic brews and harvesting parts of dead creatures for power. \n Protean \n The Protean is an archetype for the Shifter, built around a power that lets it access transformation talents the user hasn't learned. Unsurprisingly, it's best for chaos-aligned characters. \n Resizer \n The Resizer is an archetype for the Mageknight that focuses on growing and shrinking at-will. While somewhat limited at first, this ability quickly becomes flexible enough to let the Resizer adjust to changing situations. \n Warshifter \n The Warshifter is an archetype for the Shifter that makes use of the Path of War rules (from Dreamscarred Press), and is the first class to combine Spherecasting and Martial Traditions. They are notably less capable at transforming than other Shifters (although Warshifters are still better than non-Shifters at using this Sphere), but have the added utility of martial powers to make up for it.

Creature Types and Form Talents Throughout this site, various abilities require correlating creature types and subtypes to their respective form talents. The table below connects various creature types to the appropriate talent. In the case of the animal and magical beast types, general descriptions of their forms are used in the absence of defined subtypes to better match the available talents. Note that there may be specific cases where an unusual creature fits poorly with the form granted by the talent corresponding to its type. In these cases it is up to the GM to discern the most suitable talent.

      "benefits": "Unlike other forms, the Blank Form does not change the creature's basic makeup. They do not gain the +10 bonus to Disguise checks, nor do they lose their abilities, equipment, natural attacks, or any other aspect of their unaltered form. The Blank Form allows a caster to add traits to a creature without fundamentally changing the target first. A caster may grant the following traits to a creature affected by their shapeshift. A target must possess the appropriate limb where listed, and cannot grant a natural attack to a limb that already possesses a natural attack. Darkvision  60 ft \n Low-light vision \n 2 claw attacks  (Primary attacks, 1d4, 1d3 small, requires arms). You may grant this trait multiple times. \n 1 bite attack  (Primary attack, 1d6, 1d4 small, requires head).

This could include changing the target's apparent age, making an elf into an orc, disguising a large dog as a small pony, changing a male into a female, or some other such alteration. This grants the target a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. This trait may only be applied to the Blank Form, as such changes are assumed with other forms. Wiki Note:  Blank Form does not grant a form, and therefore does not qualify for effects like the Favored Form feat. Alteration Talents"

      "benefits": "You may add the following additional traits to your forms: Acid Spit:  The target may launch a glob of acid as a ranged touch attack out to Close range, dealing 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels, plus an additional 1 damage per d6 for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Spending a move action removing the acid stops the additional damage. \n Gibbering:  All creatures within 30 ft. of the target take a -2 penalty on concentration checks. This penalty increases by 1 per 5 caster levels. \n Many Eyes:  The target cannot be flanked. \n Mucus:  The target gains the ability to release a mucus cloud with a radius of 5 ft. +5 ft. per 5 caster levels that persists for 1 round per caster level unless dispersed by a strong wind. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that comes in contact with the cloud must make a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 HD + Constitution modifier or become unable to breathe air but can breath underwater for 1 round per caster level or until they spend a standard action removing the mucus. A creature unable to breathe air that remains out of water begins to suffocate. \n Roper Strands:  The target gains a roper strand. This trait may be granted multiple times, granting an additional roper strand per additional trait. As a standard action, (or full-round action if using multiple strands), the target may launch their strands, making one ranged touch attack per strand at a target within Close range. Each strands clings to the target, causing 1 Strength damage each round they remain attached (increasing by 1 die size per 5 caster levels; i.e. 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). A Fortitude save (10 + 1/2 HD + Con modifier) negates this damage for the round. A creature cannot be affected more than once per round. Strands have an HP, and Hardness equal to the effect's caster level, and a break DC, escape artist DC, and AC equal to 10 + the effect's caster level. However, strands are instantly severed by any slashing damage, which bypasses its hardness automatically. Creatures connected by roper strands may not move away from each other, though may choose to move closer or laterally. Moving farther requires severing the strand with an attack, breaking it with a strength check, or removing it with an escape artist check, or succeeding on a drag combat maneuver against the target they are connected to. When two targets are connected by a strand, they may make drag combat maneuver checks against each other at range without provoking attacks of opportunity. If a strand is broken, the target instantly regrows the strand, and may still make strand attacks."

In water, this creates a 10 ft. radius sphere that provides total concealment and persists for 1 minute.

You may add the following trait to your forms: Death Roll:  You may, upon succeeding on a grapple check to deal damage with your bite attack, make an additional grapple check as a free action. If successful, the target is prone. This additional grapple check does not count toward maintaining the grapple, and doesn't add any other effects (such as constrict) beyond knocking the target prone. \n Strangle:  An opponent grappled by the target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. \n Swallow Whole:  The target gains the swallow whole ability, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d6 acid damage per 3 caster levels.

The amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 the creature's total hit points. This damage is inflicted on the swallowing creature as normal. The Armor Class of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the swallowing creature cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed.

The swarm has the distraction ability, forcing any creature that takes swarm damage must make a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 HD + Constitution modifier or be nauseated for 1 round. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a MSB check (DC 20 + 1/2 caster level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration while in the swarm requires a DC 20 Will save. Natural attacks cannot be added to this form through traits. The target may choose to ignore any creatures in its space, choosing to not deal the swarm damage, force MSB checks to cast spells, or force Will saves to skills. The swarm form is incapable of performing combat maneuvers and they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed. Creatures in swarm form take 50% more damage from effects that affect an area. Creatures in swarm form do not threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack.

A creature that retains a natural attack (such as a shifter via a bestial trait) cannot use this natural attack, but uses d8 for its swarm damage. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. The appearance of the individual creatures in the swarm may correspond to the shapes of any creature for which you possess the appropriate talent to imitate.

Old Advanced Alteration Talents Click the header above to visit the Advanced Talents page. This page includes talents that are more powerful than the ones presented on this page - but remember, Advanced Talents are only available with GM permission. Old Alteration Drawbacks Click the header above to see the Sphere-Specific Drawbacks for this sphere. If you're using the optional Casting Tradition rules, Drawbacks allow you to acquire one or more bonus talents in a sphere in exchange for a limit on using this sphere. Archetypes Specializing in Alteration - Old Apex Shifter The Apex Shifter is a Shifter who specializes in changing into different forms using the Alteration sphere. - Old Beastsoul Monk The Beastsoul Monk is an archetype for the Monk that focuses on a more primal transformation style. While not actually a caster, they gain the Transformation feat, the ability to flurry with natural attacks, and the ability to use their ki to power their transformations. It is compatible with both the standard and unchained versions of the Monk. - Old Experimentalist The Experimentalist is an archetype for the Thaumaturge that focuses on creating alchemic brews and harvesting parts of dead creatures for power. For those bothered by this flavor but interested in the power, the archetype also includes suggestions on a less cannibalistic setup. - Old Protean The Protean is an archetype for the Shifter, built around a power that lets it access transformation talents the user hasn't learned. Unsurprisingly, it's best for chaos-aligned characters. - Old Resizer The Resizer is an archetype for the Mageknight that focuses on growing and shrinking at-will. While somewhat limited at first, this ability quickly becomes flexible enough to let the Resizer adjust to changing situations. - Old Warshifter The Warshifter is an archetype for the Shifter that makes use of the Path of War rules (from Dreamscarred Press), and is the first class to combine Spherecasting and Martial Traditions. They are notably less capable at transforming than other Shifters (although Warshifters are still better than non-Shifters at using this Sphere), but have the added utility of martial powers to make up for it.

    "alteration and lycanthropy": {
      "benefits": "The Alteration sphere, the shifter class and Transformation feat especially, can work well for simulating lycanthropy in your game, avoiding the need for attempting to balance the template's boons with non-lycanthrope party members. However, if using the lycanthrope template, or using other creatures with the change shape ability such as the skinwalker race, the Alteration sphere is less than ideal. While a werewolf shifter appears synergistic and thematic on the surface, both change shape and Alteration's shapeshift are polymorph effects. As a creature can only be under a single polymorph effect at one time, which means that a creature with a racial change shape ability will find their options somewhat limited. It is recommended then that such creatures be allowed to treat their change shape forms as if they were the creatures normal form, applying traits according to their casting ability. Applying traits this way still requires the normal casting time, concentration, duration, and spell point costs that a use of shapeshift would entail. Essentially, you treat the change shape form as if it were the creature's base form for Blank Form. You of course can still apply different forms, applying the polymorph rules as normal for determining what effect supersedes the other."

    "disguise checks and shapeshift": {
      "benefits": "As shapeshift as well as other abilities interact with the disguise skill frequently, a moment should be taken to detail how abilities interact with the factors affecting Disguise check DCs. The base Alteration sphere shapeshift ability grants a +10 untyped bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a different race, gender, or species, provided the proper form is applied, though you cannot assume the form of a specific individual without the Perfect Imitation talent. The base ability also does not provide for producing clothing; a non-humanoid creature assuming a humanoid form may have some difficulty infiltrating society without pants, though the Perfect Imitation talent provides a way around this. Refer to the Form Talent/Creature Type table in Section 2 for a guide as to what talents correspond to different creature types. Obviously there is not a penalty for making Disguise checks without a disguise kit when using shapeshift. While you may have the shape of the creature you wish to imitate, this does not confer knowledge of speech patterns, posture, or other subtle cues that could alert others to your deception, thus the various modifiers for being disguised as another race, gender, or age still apply, however assuming the correct size with your shapeshift will eliminate the -10 penalty for being the wrong size. Long-term infiltrators would be advised to take the Shifting Disguise feat so as to be able to maintain their disguise for long periods without concentration or spell point cost."

    "polymorph and armor": {
      "benefits": "Since armor merges when under polymorph effects, relying on it while using the Alteration sphere beyond Blank Form is problematic. One option, available to anyone, is to craft or purchase armor with the  wild property , allowed to apply to the Alteration sphere's shapeshift per Spheres of Power. The armorist can add wild to the list of available armor properties by taking the new arsenal trick, Wild. While any creature can simply don armor appropriate to their shape after transforming, the limited duration of shapeshift makes this solution problematic barring the Permanent Transformation advanced talent, the Transformation feat, or the shifter's class features. Once the shapeshift effect ends, armor donned while shifted that does not fit the base form falls off in the creature's square. Other items that may have been equipped during the transformation may be retained or fall off as the GM deems appropriate. For example, a headband may be retained, but rings and gloves on an extra set of arms would fall to the ground. As usual, equipping multiple items that occupy the same magic item slot does not grant additional benefits. Shifters can take the Barding bestial trait, available with 14 class levels. The armorist has a two additional ways to mitigate the armor issue with varying degrees of preparation and cost. Once able to summon armor, a polymorphed armorist can simply summon armor in the form of armor or barding appropriate to their current shape. This has the advantage of working for any shape, but if you change shape again new armor will have to be summoned. If focusing primarily on a single form, an armorist capable of binding armor may form their bound armor to suit their preferred form. This provides no benefit in their default form, but in the chosen form they can still benefit fully from the higher enchantment level of bound armor. Additionally, armorists with the symbiotic knight archetype can form their symbiotic armor over any form, reforming it whenever changing shape."

    "what is harmless?": {
      "benefits": "When cast on a willing target, consider shapeshift to be harmless. As a harmless effect, creatures normally immune to polymorph effects, such as undead and constructs, may still benefit from it without further talents or abilities required. Adaptation No expansion to the Alteration sphere could comprehensively cover the bewildering variety of unusual abilities and shapes found just in the animal kingdom, not even considering the range of unique abilities belonging to magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, aberrations, and outsiders that have been published. Attempting to make a unique talent for every possible combination required to represent individual creatures would thus be excessive. The talents included here are intended to cover broad categories and allow the players to fill in specific details by adding traits appropriate to the desired form rather than to give a form for every possible creature. Additionally, excessive overlap between talents has been avoided where possible. However, there will be instances that a particular creature needs to be emulated and the existing talents do so poorly or inefficiently. Perhaps a player wants to have a peculiar form of lycanthropy for their character or the GM has a particular concept suited to a custom world. In cases like these, it is entirely reasonable to create new talents to suit the situation. Careful attention should be given to the suite of abilities for any new form, comparing them to existing forms to weigh cost and strength. The duck-billed platypus will serve as a fair demonstration, as few creatures have such an unusual set of abilities. Using existing talents, neither animalistic transformation nor aquatic transformation fit well, the first being rather too speedy, the second lacking appropriate limbs, and both giving extra abilities that are not desired. A quadruped base form with reduced speed and lacking scent and a bite attack would be a place to start. Add on a swim speed and a unique secondary natural attack than can deliver a poison should get you about where you want to be, resulting in something like this: Platypus Transformation \nYou may grant the form of a duck-billed platypus with your shapeshift. The form has a head, tail, and 4 legs with all the benefits of being a quadruped. The target gains a 20 ft. land speed and a 20 ft. swim speed. The target also gains poised barbs on its hind legs, acting as a secondary natural attack (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, piercing damage) with Poison (Injury) DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Constitution Modifier, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, 1d2 Constitution damage, cure 1 save. In addition, you may grant the following traits to any form: Swim: A swim speed as granted by the Platypus form. \n Barbs: Barb natural attack (secondary 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, piercing) Another example would be a bat (or dire bat or bat-like magical beast). Avian form is not quite right, so swapping out the two talon attacks for a bite attack and giving darkvision in place of low-light vision is a fairly simple change. Granting blindsight or blindsense, however, would require a spell point to be spent. Compare to the Blindfolded Oracle talent of the Divination sphere, which requires a spell point and closing your eyes, though it has a longer duration. A giant worm, for another example, could be modeled using the constrictor package of Serpentine transformation, then reduce the land speed, remove the climb speed and low light vision, and add a burrow speed and tremorsense. Tremorsense and a burrow speed are often going to be more useful than low light vision and a climb speed, so removing constrict as well should get you to a reasonable spot. Some creatures are difficult to model within the constraints of a single talent. For example, griffons have a fly speed, pounce, three natural attacks and rake. They are suitably simulated with Animalistic Transformation for the base form, then adding wings and additional attacks and abilities via other talents. While this works well enough, it makes simulating a griffon difficult in the early levels. Obviously handing out flight at level one without cost can create issues, but allowing a character to have cosmetic wings or talons, granting no mechanical effect, can help them to seem closer to the goal than otherwise possible. Characters taking the Transformation feat for unusual or powerful animals, if unable to fit them well into existing talents or comparable new talents, are advised to go this route until they are able to gain the Improved Transformation feat enough times to achieve their goal. Choosing mechanics that get you as close as possible and then changing the way they are described is fully encouraged."

    "blood arts [bap]": {
      "benefits": "The Blood and Portents handbook introduces a new set of Blood sphere talents marked (blood art). These talents grant a Blood sphere caster the ability to cast blood arts, which briefly manipulate or transfigure blood. You may use blood as a catalyst to create effects known as blood arts. Casting a blood art is a standard action, unless otherwise stated, and has a range of close. As part of casting any blood art, either the caster's or the target's blood is briefly manipulated, causing that creature to suffer a small amount of damage known as \"blood loss\". Blood loss is inflicted on the creature whose blood is manipulated by a blood art in addition to but separate from any of the blood art's normal effects. A creature who suffers blood loss takes untyped damage equal to 1/2 the blood art caster's Blood sphere caster level (minimum 1). This damage cannot be prevented and bypasses any temporary hit points the target may possess. A creature who cannot suffer blood loss cannot be the target of a blood art. Targets that gain immunity to bleed damage from their creature type, subtype, or a template cannot suffer blood loss. Creatures that gain immunity to bleed damage from other sources are susceptible to blood loss, but still benefit from their immunity against bleed damage. Some creatures that are normally immune to bleed damage but that frequently feed on blood may be susceptible to blood loss. Any creature that has used the blood drain universal monster ability in the previous hour or any creature composed largely of blood (such as a blood golem) may suffer blood loss. Other appropriate creatures may also suffer blood loss, at the GM's discretion. Author's Note: \"What Exactly Is Blood Loss\" Blood loss is an additional \"cost\" associated with a blood art. It is damage, but it is not the sphere effect's damage. It cannot be modified, increased or interacted with like a sphere effect's regular damage or effects. Metamagic contingent on an effect dealing damage to a target, such as the Dazing Spell metamagic, would not consider or treat the blood loss mechanic as the sphere effect's damage. Suffering blood loss as part of casting a blood art does not force the caster to make a concentration check. Blood Sphere Talents"

      "benefits": "When a creature within blood control range takes bleed damage to their hit points, as a free action that may be taken even when it is not your turn, you may choose a different creature under the effects of your blood control to gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to the bleed damage taken by the first creature. These temporary hit points never stack with those gained from other instances of this ability nor with those gained from the same instance on other rounds. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute per caster level. Each creature may only provide temporary hit points to one other creature. As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to inflict 1d2 points of Constitution damage to a creature under the effects of your blood control, then choose a different creature under the effects of your blood control to heal a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the first creature times the amount of Constitution damage dealt. If you possess Mass Control, you may spend an additional spell point as per that talent to inflict the Constitution damage on multiple creatures and heal multiple creatures. The total number of affected creatures cannot exceed your Mass Control limit and no creature can be targeted by the Constitution damage more than once per round. A single creature can be healed multiple times."

Creatures that are in this area when it is cast or that start their turn within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be under the effects of your blood control until the end of a turn in which they did not start within the affected area. Select a (quicken) or a (still) ability as part of creating this area; you may apply the selected ability to the affected creatures. Creatures that succeed at a saving throw against blood control while within the vortex cannot be affected by that vortex again. You may spend an additional spell point to increase this radius by +10 feet increasing by +5 feet at 7th caster level and every 7 levels thereafter. This spread does not obscure vision. You do not need to be able to see or be aware of the affected creatures, though you are aware of any that fail their save. You may use this ability to target swarms. You may concentrate to maintain this area, moving it up to 20 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels when you concentrate, flying with perfect maneuverability.

If you chose blood control and it is under the effects of your blood control, you may apply a new (quicken) or (still) effect to the blood control effect.

    "extract blood construct": {
      "benefits": "You may drain the blood of a dead creature within blood control range and animate it as a blood construct as a standard action within 1 minute per caster level of the creature's death. If the creature (or creatures) were under the effects of your blood control at the time of their death, you may reduce the required time to a swift action. This blood construct is of a size according to the below table, but may not be larger than one size smaller than the dead creature's size. See the  Sphere Bestiary  for the statistics of the blood construct. Extracted constructs are under your control. While they can be dispelled, blood constructs are neither called nor summoned creatures, so are not affected by banishment, dismissal, or the Hallow word of the Fate sphere. The construct obeys your commands to the best of its ability, even harmful or suicidal commands and will generally act to protect you in the absence of other commands. A blood construct created by this ability persists for as long as you concentrate. The construct must be within your blood control range to concentrate on it. You may spend a spell point to have the blood construct remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. Doing so allows the construct to leave your blood control range without any ill effects. Lengthened Control increases this duration to 1 hour per caster level. You may not have more than 3 Hit Dice of blood constructs per caster level under your control at the same time; creating additional constructs forces you to dismiss existing elements until the total Hit Dice no longer exceed this cap. Temporary increases to caster level (such as from staves, boons, or the thaumaturge's forbidden lore ability) do not increase this cap. Once a blood construct is dismissed or destroyed, the blood used can no longer be animated to create another blood construct. As a move or swift action, you may sacrifice a blood construct under your control to heal another one that you control, restoring a number of hit points equal to the hit points of the sacrificed construct. Any excess hit points beyond the healed construct's maximum hit points are lost. Both creatures must be within blood control range. If you possess Mass Control, you may target multiple creatures per that talent, drawing blood to either create multiple constructs or combining the blood into a larger construct, up to the maximum size you can create, counting two Small creatures as a Medium creature, two Medium creatures as a Large creature, etc. You may increase the size of an existing construct under your control by merging smaller constructs with it as part of their creation or as a standard action; any ongoing effects and damage taken on either construct persist in the larger construct. All targets must be within blood control range.

The creature suffers a 20% miss chance against all creatures for the duration of the bleed damage. If you spend an additional spell point, the creature is instead blinded for the duration of the bleed damage as blood streams from around its eyes. Creature's without eyes or equivalent sensory organs are immune to this effect."

    "hemo goblin [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to target a creature within blood control range that is taking bleed damage, under the effects of your blood control, or has less than half their hit points remaining. You summon a hemo goblin, an otherwise ordinary goblin , into a square adjacent to the target. The hemo goblin gains a bonus to its armor class, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks equal to your caster level. The hemo goblin fights the target to the death, and will relentlessly pursue the target if they try to run. The goblin cannot be given commands nor can it be convinced to do anything but attack the target. This sphere effect lasts for 24 hours, until the hemo goblin is killed, or when the target dies, whichever comes first. A hemo goblin disappears when this sphere effect ends or when it dies. A hemo goblin does not leave a corpse. The hemo goblin has an unnatural sense of where the target is as though it were constantly locating the target's general position as though using the Divination sphere Dowsing sphere effect and automatically succeeds at Survival checks to follow the target's tracks. A hemo goblin does not automatically locate the target if they are hidden or difficult to find (such as invisibility or a safe house), or traveled a large distance in a short period of time (such as using the Warp sphere True Teleport advanced talent). If you possess the Mass Blood Magic talent, you may spend an additional spell point to summon a goblin for each additional valid target."

As a standard action, you may cause a volume of blood within blood control range equal in size to a Small object to move up to 20 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster levels. The blood may be moved through the air and does not fall to the ground until the end of a turn in which you choose not to move it. If you possess the Telekinesis sphere, you may use your telekinesis speed if it is greater. The volume increases by 1 Small object per caster level and the distance it may be moved increases by 5 ft. per 2 caster levels. If moving a volume of blood of at least Small size, you may attempt a bullrush or overrun maneuver against any one creature in the path of this movement, using your caster level -5 plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. You gain a +1 bonus on this check for each size larger than Small the volume of blood is, treating 2 Small volumes as Medium, 2 Medium volumes as Large, etc. If you possess Mass Control, you may target multiple volumes, but the total volume cannot exceed your maximum volume. The mostly intact corpse of a creature that was susceptible to bleed damage that has been dead for less than 1 hour per caster level can supply a volume of 1 size category smaller than itself. You may use this ability to reposition the blood trail left by spending a spell point on the Slick talent, treating 1 square as a Small object. You may spend a spell point to grant a blood construct under your control a fly speed (perfect) equal to your move blood speed for the duration of its existence. Blood Arc:  As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to cause an arc of blood to launch from any creature under the effects of your blood control that is taking bleed damage. You may target a creature within that range, who then must succeed on a Reflex save or be blinded until it spends a standard action or two move actions wiping the blood off. Immersion in water, heavy rain, or similar effects may also end this effect. If you possess Mass Control, you may target multiple creatures with this ability, though a single bleeding creature cannot supply more than two blood arcs. If you possess Manipulate Alchemy, you may attempt to transfer a formulae (see the  Alchemy  sphere), potion, or poison expelled since the start of your previous turn via the blood arc. Creatures that are willing or that fail their Reflex save are immediately affected by a formulae, potion, or poison and may make a save against it if normally allowed. If you possess Manipulate Health, you may attempt to transfer a disease expelled since the start of your previous turn via the blood arc. Creatures that fail their Reflex save must immediately make a save against the disease."

      "benefits": "As part of casting a blood art or blood control, you may increase the casting time by one step (usually a standard to a full-round action) and inflict 1 point of Constitution damage to yourself. If you do, make a melee touch attack or ranged touch attack against a creature within your blood control range, marking them with your blood. If successful, the struck creature is marked by your blood for 1 round per caster level. A marked creature is treated as though it had less than half its maximum hit points remaining for the purpose of the save penalty of any blood control targeting that creature, and your Blood sphere effects targeting the struck creature ignore any spell resistance it possesses. A marked creature can spend a standard action or two move actions to wipe the blood off and end this effect. Immersion in water, heavy rain, or similar effects may also end this effect, subject to GM discretion. When delivering this effect as a melee touch attack, you may hold the charge, and if you possess the Hemokinesis talent, you may hold the charge when using the ranged option. If used on a creature that is immune to bleed damage from their creature type, subtype, or a template, you may ignore their immunity to blood control for the duration of this effect, though they do not take the save penalty for being below 1/2 their maximum hit points.

If instilling a blood art, you must suffer blood loss as part of instilling the effect, and a creature who consumes the instilled liquid is treated as the target of that blood art, suffering blood loss as appropriate. You must spend a spell point to allow the blood control to endure without concentration. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created.

This loss increases by one die size (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.) for every five caster levels. Creatures that possess spell slots instead lose spell slots, based on the level of the slot. Each slot is equivalent to a number of spell points: level 1-2: 1 spell point, 3-5: 2 spell points, 6-8: 3 spell points, 9: 4 spell points. The target creature chooses which spell slots are lost. If affecting a creature with psionic manifesting (Psionics Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press), the creature loses a number of power points equal to the number of spell points that would have been lost multiplied by 1 + its Hit Dice/4. If you possess Absorb Blood, you may choose to grant an equal number of temporary spell points to a creature receiving healing from Absorb Blood, though they cannot receive more spell points than your target loses. These temporary spell points do not stack with spell points from other targets, other instances of this ability, or any other source and expire after one round per caster level.

This effect persists until you end it as a free action, the creature stops taking bleed damage, or your blood control ends. Your vision is not impaired by a mist you create. If you spend an additional spell point, the radius of the mist increases to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. The mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the mist in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the mist in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the mist in the area into which it deals damage. If dispersed or burned away, the mist returns at the start of the creature's next turn unless the bleed damage or blood control has ended. If you choose to take 1 Constitution damage when using this talent, you may treat all creatures within the mist as if they were below half their maximum hit points for the purpose of the save penalty on any instance of blood control targeting such a creature."

When a cyst bursts, the target immediately suffers damage equal to your blood loss, and any adjacent enemies are exposed to a single disease the target is suffering from (of your choice), and must immediately succeed at a save against that disease or become afflicted by it. Note:  If using the optional ruleset for Called Shots, any creature can attempt to burst a cyst by making an easy called shot. As a (blood art), you can cause a single creature within range to suffer blood loss and suddenly manifest a large cyst, which immediately bursts.

Weapons or ammunition created by this effect count as masterwork and last for as long as they are held or otherwise in your physical possession, but dissipate if they leave your possession for more than one round. Weapons created by this effect gain a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels you possess (maximum +5). Whenever you deal damage to an opponent with a weapon created by this talent, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) which last for 1 round. Weapons which use ammunition (e.g. bows, firearms, or slings) are created with basic ammunition ready to be fired by the weapon, and basic ammunition may be summoned and automatically loaded into the weapon as a free action without suffering blood loss. A double-weapon created with this effect must divide its enhancement bonuses between the two ends, but you may suffer blood loss a second time when using this talent to have each end gain enhancement bonuses independently. This ability cannot be used to summon siege weapons or technological items, subject to GM permission. Special:  If you possess the Alteration sphere, you may create any one natural attack you could grant as a trait to yourself with this talent which lasts until dismissed as a standard action. You may only possess one natural attack created this way at any time."

The target selects one of their movement speeds and gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to it, +5 feet per 5 caster levels you possess. As a free action, the target can change the selected movement speed once during their turn. If you spend an additional spell point when using this ability, you also grant the creature a fly speed of 20 feet and average maneuverability for one minute. While this form of flight does not necessarily manifest as wings, it is considered winged flight for all purposes. As a (blood art), as a standard action or as a swift action if using this effect on a willing creature, you can cause a creature within range to suffer blood loss and move 10 feet in any one direction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An unwilling creature may attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect, suffering no blood loss. The target gains a +4 bonus to their saving throw if they would be moved somewhere intrinsically harmful (onto a bed of spikes, into the air, etc.)."

Whenever you would take blood loss damage, these temporary hit points are lost first. In addition, you may infuse another creature with a portion of your vitality. As a standard action, you suffer blood loss and grant another creature within range temporary hit points equal to twice the blood loss plus your casting ability modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute per caster level. If you spend an additional spell point when casting this effect, the target is also healed for an amount of damage equal to the number of temporary hit points they receive.

On a failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss, takes 1d6 piercing damage per 2 caster levels you possess (minimum 1d6), and is staggered for 1 round. Instead of targeting a creature, you may suffer blood loss as a standard action to launch a projectile made of blood, such as a spear or whirling scythe. Make a ranged touch attack against the target with a circumstance bonus on your attack roll equal to the blood loss. On a successful hit, the target suffers blood loss and 1d6 piercing damage per 2 caster levels you possess (minimum 1d6) and must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. If you spend an additional spell point when casting this blood art either to target a creature or to launch a projectile, creatures staggered by this effect are instead staggered for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. If you possess Mass Blood Magic, when casting this effect to launch a projectile, you may spend an additional spell point to pierce multiple foes. Choose a number of additional targets no greater than 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Make a ranged touch attack against the initial target then each additional target in order. No target can be farther than 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels from the previous target and no target can be targeted more than once.

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to use blood control to take control of the target's body. For 1 round per caster level or until the blood control ends (whichever comes first), you can concentrate on the target, spending an action to force the target's body to take the same type of action, acting on simultaneously. The puppetted creature's body is under your control, but the creature's mind is not. Creatures capable of taking purely mental actions can still do so. If you spend at least a standard action controlling the puppet, this counts as concentrating on the blood control. A creature under the effects of this ability cannot take physical action on its own; treat this as being dazed, though immunity to and bonuses on saving throws against the dazed condition does not apply. The target may be forced to take harmful actions. A target forced to hurt or kill itself deals its weapon damage + its Strength modifier to itself per round as a standard action. The target may still perform mental-only actions while under the effects of blood puppet (such as attempting to end the blood control). This ability does not grant access to the target's memories, thoughts, casting, supernatural, or spell-like abilities, nor is your control fine enough to force the target to speak intelligibly. Effects such as the protection from evil spell or the Hallow word of the Fate sphere do not end this effect, since it is the result of a physical malady rather than a mind-affecting or possession effect. If you possess Mass Control, you may take control and command multiple puppets, but must divide a single round's worth of actions between all puppets."

When a willing creature under the effects of your blood control would be knocked unconscious due to hit point damage, you may allow them to enter a delirious state of consciousness as an immediate action by spending one spell point. The target suffers one bleed damage, is not knocked unconscious, and gains the benefits of the Diehard feat for as long as they suffer from this bleed damage. If the creature already possesses the Diehard feat, they instead are no longer staggered while using the benefits of the feat as long as they suffer from the bleed damage. The bleed damage automatically ends when your blood control ends. As a (quicken) ability, you can accelerate bursts of vigor and energy within a creature to tire them out easily. If that creature would receive healing, they instead convert that healing into temporary hit points that remain for 1 minute. The amount of hit points granted is still limited by how much healing the creature could have gained, including limitations such as their maximum health, or heals that cannot heal a creature above half their maximum health. If the creature would gain temporary hit points from a source other than this talent, the duration of those temporary hit points are reduced to 1 round. As a (still) ability, you can spend a spell point to temporarily halt the blood flow of a creature in such a way they can still survive. At the start of their turn each round, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed until the start of their next turn. This paralysis lasts until the creature succeeds at the Fortitude save, even if your blood control expires, although the creature gains a +8 bonus on their Fortitude save if you do not have blood control established with them. As long as the creature is paralyzed, they appear dead and no longer require oxygen to survive. A Heal check (DC 20 + your caster level) allows a creature to identify that the creature is still alive. Special:  If you possess the Inject talent, this ability can be used on an undead creature to grant them a +5 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks made to disguise or pass off as a living creature. You may also use the Inject talent to permanently infuse a corpse with a pulse as a standard action. Creatures who interact with such a corpse must succeed at a Heal check (DC 20 + your caster level) or believe the corpse is alive, but paralyzed, rather than dead."

As a (quicken) effect, you may boost the circulation of the target of your blood control, allowing the target to ignore one instance of the fatigued or staggered conditions and treat one instance of the exhausted condition as fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the target's Constitution modifier. After a creature benefits from this ability, it cannot do so again for one minute per round the ability was active. Creatures that do not breathe do not benefit from this effect If you spend a spell point, the target may make an extra attack as part of a full attack or make additional attacks of opportunity (as the Improved Haste Time sphere talent) for the duration of this effect. This does not stack with similar effects such as the Improved Haste Time sphere talent. When used this way, the target is fatigued at the end of this effect.

You may end this delay as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your turn, causing the formulae, potion, or poison to take effect immediately. A given creature may only have one effect delayed in this manner at a time, plus one additional effect per 10 caster levels. As a (still) ability, as a swift action, you may slow circulation to improve the body's ability to resist a poison. If the target is affected by a poison with a frequency measured in rounds, the frequency instead becomes minutes. If the frequency was measured in minutes, it instead becomes hours. These changes do not stack. The save DC of the poison is decreased by -2. This change lasts for the duration of the poison unless dispelled or ended with a (quicken) talent. As a (quicken) ability, you may speed circulation to improve the potency of a poison in the target's system. If the poison had a frequency measured in minutes, it is now measured in rounds. If it has a frequency measured in rounds, its frequency becomes twice per round and the duration is halved. These changes do not stack. The save DC of the poison is also increased by +2. This change lasts until for the duration of the poison unless dispelled or ended with a (still) talent. As a (quicken) ability, as an immediate action, you may attempt to force a formulae, potion, or poison out of the target's body, removing its effects from the target. This requires a magical skill check against the formulae or poison's save DC or the potion's MSD. Unwilling targets are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect.

The drum that keeps all living creatures functional is an instrument you know how to outplay. As a (still) ability, you may temporarily strip a creature of the need for blood to allow them to keep living. As an immediate action made when a willing creature under your blood control would be slain or knocked unconscious by hit point damage, you can cause that creature to ignore the need for blood by spending 3 spell points. For one round, that creature cannot be slain by hit point damage, cannot suffer ability damage or drain to their Constitution, Dexterity or Strength scores and does not fall unconscious for having negative hit points. However, in this state, the creature treats their Constitution score as if it were 1, suffers a -4 penalty to their armor class, and all temporary hit points they would gain are reduced to 0. After this ability expires, at the start of the target's next turn, they must succeed at a Fortitude save against a DC of 15 + the amount of negative hit points below their death threshold (the number of negative hit points they may have before dying of hit point damage) or immediately die. If they succeed, the creature falls unconscious with a number of negative hit points equal to their death threshold plus one. As this ability is extremely taxing on a creature's body to use, attempting to use this ability on a creature more than once every 24 hours automatically fails. As a (still) ability, you may spend two spell points to stop a creature's heart entirely. At the beginning of that creature's turns, they must succeed at a Fortitude save (the creature suffers a -4 penalty to this saving throw if they are below half their maximum hit points) or be reduced to 1 hit point and become sickened and staggered for the duration of your blood control. If the creature was already at 1 point or lower, they are reduced to -1 hit points and fall unconscious. If the creature was already unconscious, or at -1 hit points or lower, they instead die. While under the effects of this (still) ability, a creature cannot benefit from healing from sources other than fast healing and regeneration. If a creature succeeds a saving throw against this ability, the creature no longer needs to attempt new Fortitude saves at the beginning of their turn. As a (quicken) ability, as a standard action, you can rapidly accelerate a creature's heartbeat to the point it can explode by spending one spell point. If the target possesses any temporary hit points, they must succeed at a Fortitude save or otherwise have all of their temporary hit points removed, and afterwards suffer bludgeoning damage equal to the amount of temporary hit points that were removed. If a creature has a combined total of temporary and current hit points that is greater than their maximum hit points, they suffer a -4 penalty on this save.

The targets of this effect combine and share their hit point total, with current and maximum hit points equal to the combined total of both targets. Any effect that changes the hit point total of either target (such as damage, healing, or changes to Constitution) changes this combined total. Temporary hit points are not shared by this effect, and effects which would delay or prevent incoming damage function normally (e.g. the Guardian sphere delayed damage pool would delay damage to the target as normal. When the delayed damage is emptied from the delayed damage pool it would then subtracted from the combined hit point total). This is a permanent effect which automatically ends if any of the targets die, the effect is dispelled, or the hit point total is reduced to 0 or less. If the hit point total is reduced to 0 or less, the targets are left with current hit points equal to the combined hit point total when the effect ended (e.g. if the hit point total is reduced to -5 by an attack, the effect ends and each creature would be left with -5 hit points). If this effect would otherwise end prematurely, such as a target dying to a death effect or the effect being dispelled, each creature is left with a number of hit points equal to the hit point total divided by the number of targets.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Blood sphere (Extract Blood Construct), caster level 5th. Benefit:  Whenever you use the Extract Blood Construct talent to create a blood construct, you may create that construct around a willing target that is no larger than the construct. A single creature may not have more than one instance of construct armor at a time and constructs being used as armor cannot themselves gain construct armor from another construct. The target gains the Strength, Dexterity, size, damage reduction, natural attacks, and armor class of the construct. Any damage that the target would take is instead directed to the construct. If the construct is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, this effect ends immediately and any additional damage it transferred to the target. This effect does not affect equipment size, though the target may choose to count as its normal size for the purpose of determining penalties from inappropriately sized weapons. The construct and its wearer cannot be targeted separately; any mind affecting abilities targeting the construct automatically target the wearer instead and any effect that would move either moves them both."

      "benefits": "Prerequisite:  Blood sphere. Benefit:  You may create a humor familiar. Choose a Tiny blood construct or a humoral ooze (choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic, or sanguine, chosen at the time of creation) as a familiar per the wizard's arcane bond class feature. The humor familiar can be reabsorbed into your body as a standard action. The familiar gains all familiar abilities based on your levels in casting classes. When absorbed, the humor familiar has fast healing 5 but ceases to provide bonuses such as the Alertness feat. Humoral oozes count as being in contact with their master while absorbed for the purpose of their emotional touch ability. If a humor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a ritual costing 200 gp per level in casting classes or through a specialized procedure that inflicts 1 point of Constitution damage per 2 levels (minimum 1). Replacing the familiar allows you to choose any other familiar available from this feat. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. You may not have both a humor familiar and a familiar from another source; if you possess another ability that would grant a familiar, the effective wizard level from that ability stacks with your levels in casting classes to determine the strength of your humor familiar (maximum equal to your total Hit Dice)."

Benefit:  When you gain this feat, choose an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) which you have the ability to cast as a sphere effect, spell, or spell-like ability. Once an energy type is chosen, it cannot be changed. Your blood courses with that element, and applies various effects to creatures who touch your blood. Any creature that confirms a critical hit against you with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with your blood, suffering 1 point of damage of the chosen energy type per Hit Die you possess. A successful Reflex save with a DC equal to your Blood sphere DC negates this damage. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this way. Hemokinesis using your blood adds 1 point of damage of the chosen energy type per Hit Die you possess to any creature struck by a touch attack or subject to a successful combat maneuver made as part of that ability. Additionally, you can apply your elemental blood to your weapons or natural attacks by coating it in your own blood. As a swift action, you may suffer blood loss, as though casting a blood art, to coat a weapon or natural attack in your own blood. If you are suffering from an ongoing bleed effect, or are below 1/2 your maximum hit points, you do not need to suffer blood loss when coating your weapon this way. The coated weapon gains an elemental special ability for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your Blood sphere caster level + your Constitution modifier. At 10 Hit Dice, this improves to an elemental burst special ability. When creating a weapon with the Gory Armaments talent, you can have the weapon gain an elemental special ability.

Each round the target may attempt another Fortitude save to extinguish the flames. This is a free action that may be taken once per round. Drinking any non-flammable liquid (such as a potion or water) grants the target a +4 bonus to that round's saving throw. This fire is not extinguished if the target submerges itself; it is internal. If you possess the Nature sphere (fire) package, you may spend an additional spell point to cause the burning damage the target suffers each round to be equal to the largest fire you can create with create fire, if it would be larger. \n Freeze Veins (blood art):  You rapidly freeze the target's blood, making it harder for them to move. On a failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss, takes cold damage equal to your caster level, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier.

This penalty increases by -1 for every 5 character levels. \n \n \n 71 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster's blood thickens, reducing any bleed damage taken by half but imposing a -10 ft. penalty on all movement modes and a -2 penalty on Reflex saves, Dexterity checks, and Dexterity-based skill checks. \n \n \n 72 \n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \n \n \n 73 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all creatures within 100 ft. of the caster take a -1 penalty to attack rolls and caster level while taking bleed damage.

If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 78 \n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \n \n \n 79 \n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 80 \n For 1 round per caster level, all bleed damage within 30 ft. of the caster is halved. \n \n \n 81 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 82 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the ground within 30 ft. of the target or targets becomes covered in blood, causing all creatures within this area to slip as per the Slick talent. This effect remains stationary. \n \n \n 83 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 84 \n The caster begins taking bleed damage equal to caster level. This effect automatically ends after 1 minute. \n \n \n 85 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 86 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all hostile creatures within 100 ft. of the caster gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and caster level while taking bleed damage.

This has no mechanical effect. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points within this area that would be susceptible to the caster's blood control has a 10 ft. radius around their space filled with blood, making it difficult terrain. This difficult terrain lasts for the duration of this result. \n \n \n 89 \n All ongoing bleed damage within 60 ft. of the caster immediately stops as if targeted by the coagulate (still) ability. \n \n \n 90 \n As an instantaneous effect, any creature currently under the effects of a disease, poison, or potion and suffering from bleed damage immediately has the disease, formulae, potion, or poison effects end as the cause is drawn from its blood. \n \n \n 91 \n The casting time decreases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 92 \n For 1 round per caster level, a mist of blood as per the Red Mist talent cover an area within 60 ft. of the target or center of the target area. Any creature that enters or starts its turn within this area takes 1 acid damage per caster level. This result remains stationary. \n \n \n 93 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all creatures within 6- ft. of the caster experiences a rush of empowered blood, gaining a +10 circumstance bonus to all non-magical movement speeds. \n \n \n 94 \n All creatures allied within 60 ft. of the caster begin taking bleed damage equal to caster level. This effect automatically ends after 1 minute. \n \n \n 95 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, whenever the caster deal slashing or piercing damage to a creature within 20 ft., the caster must succeed on a Reflex save or a blinded by the spray of blood. This blindness continues until the caster spends a standard action or two move actions wiping it away. \n \n \n 96 \n The caster takes 1d4 Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \n \n \n 97 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, all creatures that die within 60 ft. of the caster have their blood extracted to create a blood construct per the Extract Blood Construct talent. Constructs created this way are hostile toward the caster and do not count against the number of Hit Dice of constructs he can control. \n \n \n 98 \n The caster is fatigued. \n \n \n 99 \n All creatures within 60 ft. of the caster begin taking bleed damage equal to caster level. This effect automatically ends after 1 minute. \n \n \n 100 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, the caster acts as if under the effects of the Blood Puppet talent, controlled by the nearest intelligent (INT greater than 2) hostile creature. The controlling creature is aware of this and intuitively knows how to use this ability. Optional Rules"

    "blood as a spell component or focus": {
      "benefits": "Using a portion of a creature's blood as an additional spell component creates a bond between the caster and the target, making the effect harder for the target to resist. Gathering sufficient blood, one vial's worth, requires inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage to a willing or helpless creature as a full-round action. When used as an additional spell component, the save DC of the spell or sphere effect is increased by +1 per vial used (to a maximum of +4) against the creature whose blood was used, though any other creatures making a save against the spell or sphere effect has the DC reduced by an equal amount. When used as a focus component, the duration of any Divination sphere effect or spell of the Divination school that would locate or contact the creature whose blood is used has its duration doubled per the Extend metamagic feat and its area increased as the Widen Spell metamagic feat, if applicable. These increases stack with the increases from those metamagic feats. Alternatively, the caster may reduce the casting time of such a spell or sphere effect by 1 step, to a minimum of 1 round. Blood does not last indefinitely, losing its potency after 1d6 hours. A successful DC10 Heal check made as a full-round action can determine the number of hours remaining. Particularly hot conditions may reduce this time, while particularly cold ones may extend it, at the GM's discretion. The most common method for preserving a sample of blood is placing it in a vial prepared with a small dose of unguent of timelessness (a vial of unguent of timelessness is sufficient to prepare 75 vials). This is sufficient to preserve the sample for 1 year. Pre-prepared vials may be purchased for 3 gp. Once used, the vial is a normal glass vial with no special properties."

Creatures that are within this area when it is cast or that start their turn within the area must make a Fortitude save or be under the effects of your blood control until the end of a turn in which they did not start within the affected area. Select a (quicken) or (still) ability as part of creating this area; you may apply the selected ability to the affected creatures. You may spend an additional spell point to increase this radius by +10 ft. increasing by +5 ft. at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter. This spread does not obscure vision. You need not be able to see or be aware of affected creatures, though you are aware of any that fail their save. You may use this ability to target swarms. You may concentrate to maintain this area, moving it up to 20 ft. plus 5 ft. per 2 caster levels when you concentrate, flying with perfect maneuverability. If you spend a spell point, the spread instead persists for 1 round per caster level and may be moved as a move action."

If a creature is damaged by this attack, you may initiate blood control on that creature (including a (quicken) or (still) effect) if it is not under the effects of your blood control. If it is under the effects of your blood control, you may apply a (quicken) or (still) effect to it. This talent may be used with the Spell Attack feat (see  Champion Feats ).

      "benefits": "As part of casting blood control, you may increase the casting time by one step (usually a standard to a full-round action) to inflict 1 point of Constitution damage on yourself and make a melee touch attack (if within your natural reach) or ranged touch attack against a creature within your blood control range. You may hold the charge if using the melee option; if you possess Hemokinesis, you may hold the charge when using the ranged option. If successful, the targeted creature is treated as if it were bleeding for the purpose of the save penalty on any instance of blood control targeting that creature. Additionally, your Blood sphere effects targeting the struck creature ignore any spell resistance it possesses. This persists for 1 round per caster level or until the creature spends a standard action or two move actions wiping the blood off. Immersion in water, heavy rain, or similar effects may also end this effect. If used on a creature that is immune to bleed damage from their creature type, subtype, or a template, you may ignore their immunity to blood control for the duration of this effect, though they do not take the save penalty for bleeding or being below half their maximum hit points. If you possess Mass Control, you may target multiple creatures, taking 1 point of Constitution damage and making an attack roll for each target."

      "benefits": "When targeting creatures with blood control or a (quicken) or (still) ability, you may spend an extra spell point to affect up to 1 additional creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) within range. All targets must be affected by the same ability. For a casting that initiates blood control, this additional cost is only incurred once; it is not paid a second time for the free (quicken) or (still) ability."

    "red mist": {
      "benefits": "As a move action, you may cause a creature under the effects of your blood control and suffering from bleed damage to have their lost blood disperse into a mist, filling their space, granting them concealment (attacks made by the creature or targeting the creature has a 20% miss chance). This effect persists until you end it as a free action, the creature stops taking bleed damage, or your blood control ends. Your vision is not impaired by a mist you create. If you spend an additional spell point, the radius of the mist increases to 5 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster levels. The mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 ft. away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the mist in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the mist in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the mist in the area into which it deals damage. If dispersed or burned away, the mist returns at the start of the creature's next turn unless the bleed damage or blood control has ended. If you choose to take 1 Constitution damage when using this talent, you may treat all creatures within the mist as if they were bleeding for the purpose of the save penalty on any instance of blood control targeting such a creature."

    "control oxygenation (quicken/still)": {
      "benefits": "You gain the following abilities: As a (still) effect, the target becomes fatigued for the duration of your blood control. You may spend a spell point to cause the creature to instead become exhausted for this duration. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this effect. As a (quicken) effect, you may boost the circulation of the target of your blood control, allowing the target to ignore one instance of the fatigued or staggered conditions and treat one instance of the exhausted condition as fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the target's Constitution modifier. After a creature benefits from this ability, it cannot do so again for one minute per round the ability was active. Creatures that do not breathe do not benefit from this effect If you spend a spell point, the target may make an extra attack as part of a full attack for the duration of this effect. This does not stack with similar effects such as the haste ability of the Time sphere. When used this way, the target is fatigued at the end of this effect. If the target was already fatigued, it is instead exhausted. If it was exhausted, it drops unconscious for 1d6 rounds."

    "manipulate alchemy (quicken/still)": {
      "benefits": "This talent requires that the target be under the effects of your blood control and cannot be used as part of initiating blood control. As a (still) ability, as an immediate action, when a creature consumes a potion or would be affected by a formulae or poison, you may delay the effect of the formulae, potion, or poison for the duration of your blood control. You may end this delay as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your turn, causing the formulae, potion, or poison to take effect immediately. A given creature may only have one effect delayed in this manner at a time, plus one additional effect per 10 caster levels. As a (quicken) ability, you may speed circulation to improve the potency of a poison in the target's system. If the poison had a frequency measured in minutes, it is now measured in rounds. If it has a frequency measured in rounds, its frequency becomes twice per round and the duration is halved. These changes do not stack. The save DC of the poison is also increased by +2. This change lasts until for the duration of the poison unless dispelled or ended with a (still) talent. As a (quicken) ability, as an immediate action, you may attempt to force a formulae, potion, or poison out of the target's body, removing its effects from the target. This requires a magical skill check against the formulae or poison's save DC or the potion's MSD. Unwilling targets are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if the target is suffering bleed damage or below one half its maximum hit points. As a (still) ability, as a swift action, you may slow circulation to improve the body's ability to resist a poison. If the target is affected by a poison with a frequency measured in rounds, the frequency instead becomes minutes. If the frequency was measured in minutes, it instead becomes hours. These changes do not stack. The save DC of the poison is decreased by -2. This change lasts until for the duration of the poison unless dispelled or ended with a (quicken) talent."

You also know if the creature is suffering from any bleed effects. As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to attempt to force a disease out of the target's body. This requires a magical skill check against the disease's save DC. Unwilling targets are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if the target is suffering bleed damage or below one half its maximum hit points. As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to force a creature suffering from a disease to roll a save against that disease. Success on this save does not count toward curing the disease and failing progresses the disease. As a (still) ability, you may immediately grant a save to a creature suffering from a disease. Success on this save counts toward curing the disease but failing has no effect. A creature may not be the target of this use more than once per day. As a (still) ability, you may delay the onset of a disease and to delay any saves forced by the disease for the duration of your blood control, though at least 1 save against the disease must be attempted every 2 days. This does not remove any penalties already inflicted by the disease, it only prevents the disease from progressing."

You must spend an action for your companion to take the same action (swift for swift, standard for standard, etc.). A puppet companion may make attacks of opportunity by spending your attacks of opportunity if you have controlled it since the beginning of your last turn. Spending at least a move action this way counts as concentrating on the summon for that round. Any round you do not spend directing the companion, it stands mindlessly and counts as having the dazed condition. Your companion may still gain feats and skills (unless also possessing the mindless archetype); you may use the companion's feats, skills, casting, and other abilities when directing the companion, though you may not use your own through the companion. Any effect that would possess or exercise mental control over a puppet companion (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects) requires a successful MSB check against the summoner's MSD. A puppet companion takes a -2 penalty on all rolls if it is outside of your close range. If you do not have line of sight to the puppet companion, it is treated as being blinded. Both these penalties are removed if you possess the Link talent. As a standard action, you may order a puppet companion to follow. Doing so causes the puppet to take move actions on its turn (including trading its standard action for a move action) to attempt to move adjacent to you (or as close as it is able) to the best of its ability. Should the companion be unable to find you (such as in a complex maze when you are out of sight for too long, if you are teleported out of view, etc.), the companion will remain in its current position.

If the companion fails the Will save, you establish control over the companion. As long as you have control over your companion it obeys your commands and treats you as friendly for the purposes of the Handle Animal skill (if it possesses the bestial archetype). However if the companion succeeds on its Will save (you are not informed if it succeeds) the companion breaks free from your control and seeks revenge against you. A creature free from your control cannot be dismissed as a free action, and remains summoned for the remainder of its normal duration plus an additional minute per caster level. You may expend a spell point as a standard action to force the companion to attempt another Will save. If it fails the Will save, it is dismissed.

Adaptation While the Conjuration sphere provides a wide variety of options for creating the companion that fits your concept, not every conceivable possibility can be anticipated by the author nor fit into print. In cases where a concept doesn't fit readily into existing talents, GMs are encouraged to work with their players to modify existing talents and create new ones. Generally, existing base forms, companion archetypes, and talents should be used as guidelines. Taking a base form and replacing one type of natural attack with another, say trading out a bite attack for a pair of claws that use damage dice one step lower. While having two attacks is better than one, the claws are also subject to the limbs to which they are attached being needed for shields, weapons, holding other objects, casting spells, or other activities. As a more involved example, let's say that a player wants to have a companion based on a marilith. Neither the biped not the serpentine base forms are quite right. While taking the serpentine base form and using the Additional Limbs talent from Spheres of Power would allow you to get there, doing so requires several talents, which may be beyond the investment reasonable at low level. Instead, we can make a new base form, starting from the serpentine base. Serpentine:   Size  Medium;  Speed  20 ft.;  AC  +4 natural armor;  Saves  Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good);  Attack  bite (1d6), tail slap (1d6);  Ability Scores  Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11 Serpentine creatures are snakes, fish, and other elongated creatures. They begin with a head, but no arms or legs. Adding a pair of arms is worth about a talent, per Additional Limbs, so we will start by removing the bite attack and giving it a pair of arms. Now since this is a base form, granting three pairs of fully functional arms would be potentially problematic. However, we can still keep the appearance by allowing the form to have three pairs of arms, but treat them as one set mechanically. Base statistics can shuffled as well. As the marilith is stronger than it is dextrous, we will swap the Strength and Dexterity starting scores. We will also swap the good Will save for a good Fortitude save to better reflect the monster's stat. That gets us pretty close. Down the road, the Additional Limbs talent can be used to make the extra arms function mechanically while other talents can fill in resistances, weapon proficiencies, and size, reflecting the increased power of the summoner's connection with his companion. This should line up reasonably well with other base forms. You end up with: Echidna:   Size  Medium;  Speed  20 ft.;  AC  +4 natural armor;  Saves  Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad);  Attack  tail slap (1d6);  Ability Scores  Str 16, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11 Echidna creatures are suitable for lamias, mariliths, merfolk, and other, similar creatures. An echidna creature begins with a head, a pair of arms, a tail, and no legs. An echidna creature has no legs and may not be tripped unless gaining legs from another source. Similarly, a scorpion could start with the vermin base form and replace the bite attack with a pair of claws (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small, piercing and slashing), possible sacrificing the climb speed for a tail with a stinger (secondary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small, piercing). Additional (form) talents may also be created, though particularly powerful abilities may increase the cost to summon the companion. Powerful abilities like attacks that deal ability drain or damage would be a good example of an ability that should carry an additional spellpoint cost.

If you or your companion possesses the  plantlife  package of the  Nature  sphere, your companion can see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, with a range of 30 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no concealment to the companion's sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of sight. If you or your companion possesses the  water  package of the  Nature  sphere, your companion may see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.

An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the companion's Hit Dice + the companion's Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a \u20134 penalty. The companion can create sheets of sticky webbing in adjacent squares up to three times its size (so a Medium companion can create a sheet that is 15 ft. by 15 ft.). Doing so requires a full-round action and counts as having used its web. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-ft.-square section of web has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the companion that created it and DR 5/\u2014. If the companion possesses a climb speed, it can move across its own web at its climb speed. While touching a web it created, the companion can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web. If your companion is dismissed, any webs it created immediately disappear."

    },
    "call planar creature": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Conjuration sphere, caster level 1st. You may call beings from other planes and bring them into your own. Calling a creature in this manner takes 10 minutes of focused casting and costs 2 spell points. Calling takes one of two forms: allies and hostiles. If you call a servant of an extraplanar being with which you have a strong connection (i.e., a cleric calling a servant of its god) they are considered an ally. All other creatures are considered hostiles, regardless of their disposition towards the caster. GMs have the final say in whether or not a character is capable of calling allies. To call a target, you must choose a location within close range for them to appear, and the kind of creature to be called must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name. You may call multiple creatures with one use of this ability (up to 3 at once) but the Hit Dice of a single creature cannot exceed your MSB, while the combined Hit Dice of all creatures cannot exceed your caster level. Allies:  Allies are never hostile and do not resist, although additional payment is always expected for their services. Payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to a quest on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per Hit Die of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per Hit Die. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per Hit Die. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (unlike a companion from the Conjuration sphere that simply returns to its home plane when reduced to 0 hit points, a called creature actually dies when it is killed). However, at the GM's discretion, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment. If an agreement cannot be reached, the ally returns to their home plane immediately. If you are not willing to give the requested payment, but attempt to press the target into service anyway, treat the creature as hostile. Pressing a creature in this way may have a detrimental effect on any future attempts to call an allied outsider. Hostiles:  If a hostile creature is unwilling to be called, it is allowed a Will saving throw to resist. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is not called. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately called (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). When a hostile creature is called, it is rooted to a specific location within range (you can decide how much space to give it, up to a 30-foot radius). It cannot leave this area until an agreement with you has been reached. It can escape this location by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your magic skill check, by teleportation or dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check pitted against a DC of your MSD + your Charisma modifier. It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can do as it pleases, including fleeing, returning to its home plane, or attacking you. If the creature does not break free of its prison, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones re-offered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to dismiss it (a free action so long as it remains trapped). Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the effect remains for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. At the end of its task, or when the bargained duration expires, a called ally returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible)."

You cannot know the result of your Spellcraft check until after the calling is performed, but you may take 20 on this check by dedicating 3 hours and 20 minutes to creating the circle. If your check is successful, the called creature cannot use its spell resistance to attempt to escape its prison, nor use any dimensional or teleportation effects, nor can any of its abilities or attacks cross the prison's border.

Each creature has half their normal maximum hit points. Both react to the caster as normal. \n \n \n 69 \n A swarm of butterflies appears in the summoned or called creature's square and follows it until slain.

One creature of the GM's choice native to the selected plane with a CR not exceeding caster level appears out of the rift each round for a 1d6 rounds and attacks the caster and his allies. \n \n \n 73 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 74 \n (Combat) All summoned creatures within long range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be dismissed. \n \n \n 75 \n An outsider of an alignment matching the caster's of the GM's choosing is called per the Summoning advanced talent, appearing adjacent to the caster. This creature has Hit Dice equal to the maximum possible for that talent and is not bound or controlled in any way. \n \n \n 76 \n One imp, lantern archon, mephit (any type), or quasit (GM's choice, should be naturally hostile to caster) per caster level is called and appears within close range of the caster. These creatures are not controlled and act according to their natures. \n \n \n 77 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 78 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains resistance to fire equal to your caster level. This stacks with any resistance it already possesses. \n \n \n 79 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature glows brightly (per the glow ability of the Light sphere). This counts as a glow originating from the caster. \n \n \n 80 \n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 81 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains resistance to cold equal to your caster level. This stacks with any resistance it already possesses. \n \n \n 82 \n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \n \n \n 83 \n The casting time decreases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 84 \n The caster is exhausted. \n \n \n 85 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 86 \n A small elemental is called adjacent to the caster. This elemental is hostile to all creatures and attacks the nearest to the best of its ability. The size of this elemental increases with caster level: CL 5 - medium, CL 10 - large, CL 15 - huge, CL 20 - elder. Roll 1d4 to determine the elemental type, 1 - air, 2 - earth, 3 - fire, 4 - water. \n \n \n 87 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature loses 1 hit point per round. This cannot reduce the creature below 1 hit point. \n \n \n 88 \n The summoned or called creature refuses to remain in any space not adjacent to an ally of the caster chosen randomly at the time the effect is cast. \n \n \n 89 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains alignment subtypes for all alignments. \n \n \n 90 \n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 91 \n The caster takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \n \n \n 92 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains vulnerability to fire. \n \n \n 93 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature is invisible to the caster's allies. The caster is unaffected. \n \n \n 94 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains vulnerability to electricity. \n \n \n 95 \n The summoned or called creature is two sizes smaller than normal, per the Altered Size (form) talent, to a minimum size of Fine. This may decrease the companions size beyond the limits of Altered Size, granting an additional -2 Strength and +2 Dexterity per additional size category. \n \n \n 96 \n The creature closest to the caster must succeed on a Will save or be merged with the summoned or called creature for 10 minutes per caster level. The affected creature retains all mental ability scores, feats, base saving throw bonuses, and class abilities but uses the physical body (including physical ability scores, extraordinary abilities, hit points, and all abilities derived from (form) talents) of the summoned or called creature. The summoned or called creature does not retain any feats or casting ability it would have and the affected creature does not retain any extraordinary or supernatural abilities derived from race, template, or other sources other than classes and feats. \n \n \n 97 \n The summoned or called creature is staggered until banished, dismissed, or slain. \n \n \n 98 \n The summoned or called creature is distrustful of the caster and attempts to resist any effects the caster or the caster's allies use on it and does not benefit from flanking or aid another bonuses from the caster or the caster's allies. \n \n \n 99 \n The summoned or called creature and the caster are empathically linked. Any time the companion receives damage, the caster takes half that amount of nonlethal damage regardless of distance. Apply the target's damage reduction, immunity, and resistance prior to splitting the damage. The transferred damage bypasses all damage reduction, resistance, and immunity. \n \n \n 100 \n For the duration of the effect, the summoned or called creature gains resistance to nonlethal equal to your caster level. This stacks with any resistance it already possesses. Gamemastering"

    "too many companions": {
      "benefits": "The Conjuration sphere raises concerns among many regarding both action economy overwhelming encounters and additional bodies swamping the game. While the Conjuration sphere offers interesting options for solo campaigns, letting a single character cover numerous other roles, the more standard group campaign requires different considerations. The simplest expedient is not allowing a player to have a large number of companions summoned simultaneously. A gentleman's agreement with the GM and other players to either not take Extra Companion frequently or to not summon more than one or two at a time is an obvious solution. Specializing your companions for different situations and only summoning them when needed, such as summoning a rogue-like companion to check for traps, then dismissing it to summon a more battle focused companion before setting an ambush, reduces the number of bodies on the field. Another option is to allow other players to control some of the companions, keeping the other players engaged and active, investing them in the companion's development and wellbeing. The other players could be allowed a degree of latitude to portray a unique personality for the companion, emphasizing that it is a separate intelligence rather than a mere extension of the caster. This should only be done after consulting with the other players, obviously. Be aware that this invites the other players' input in how the companion, and by extension the caster, is built, which may be unwelcome to some players."
    },
    "keep it moving": {
      "benefits": "The responsibility to keep turns manageable ultimately belongs to the player. Sheets for companions should be kept ready and be well known to the player to limit sheet-searching for the proper ability. If the character possesses ways to change companions from day to day, the player should keep up-to-date sheets for any variations he or she expects to use to prevent having to make others wait while statting up a new companion. Expedients such as rolling multiple different colored dice, using dice rolling software, or otherwise speeding rolls can also prove conducive to shorter turns with multiple creatures."
    },
    "summoning and calling": {
      "benefits": "The base summon ability has the [summoning] descriptor, and as such a Conjuration sphere companion cannot touch creatures warded with the appropriate protection from (alignment) spell, the Hallow word of the Fate sphere, and similar effects. This limitation bars the companion from striking a creature so warded with any weapons that the companion gains from Conjuration sphere talents. A Conjuration sphere companion is sent home by dispel magic, the Counterspell feat, and similar effects, though may be re-summoned as if the duration of the summon had ended, incurring the normal cost and casting time. If the companion is dismissed, dispelled, or slain, any spells or sphere effects it cast expire immediately (per the summoning descriptor). A Conjuration sphere companion winks out if they enter an antimagic field or similar effect. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the summon. If an antimagic field spell, Spell Ward ward from the Protection sphere, or similar effect is cast in an area occupied by a Conjuration sphere companion that has spell resistance, the caster must make a MSB check against the companion's spell resistance to make it wink out. Natural and weapon attacks originating from Conjuration sphere companions are not normally subject to spell resistance. The Summoning advanced talent, despite its name, has the [calling] descriptor. Thus creatures brought with this talent actually die when they are killed; they do not disappear and reform. Additionally, they may attack creatures warded with the appropriate protection from (alignment) spell, the Hallow word of the Fate sphere, and similar effects normally, can enter antimagic fields and similar effects, and can't be dispelled."
    },
    "companion details": {
      "benefits": "Similar to a summoner's eidolon, a Conjuration sphere companion does not gain the normal skill points, weapon proficiencies, or darkvision trait normally granted by the outsider type. Companions act on their own initiative count unless otherwise noted. There is no limit on the alignment of a Conjuration sphere companion relative to the alignment of the caster, though if the companion possesses a non-neutral alignment the summon ability gains spell descriptors matching its alignment. A companion that disappears due to being reduced to 0 hit points does not benefit from fast healing, regeneration, or other similar effects until such a time as the caster can summon it again normally (usually after the caster rests for 8 hours to regain spell points). Ongoing effects continue to have effect and expend duration while a companion is not summoned. Ability damage, ability drain, and other effects persist while the companion is not summoned. Should a companion be slain by Constitution drain, negative levels, or other similar effects, it may be summoned after resting to regain spell points as usual, with the penalty reduced by the minimum value required to allow the companion to be alive. The Magical Companion (form) talent does not grant the two free bonus talents for possessing the casting class feature."
    },
    "roleplaying a companion": {
      "benefits": "Conjuration sphere companions are normally directly under the player's control. They obey commands, even if the commands would obviously cause the companion harm, as the worst that can happen is that they vanish to be re-summoned another time. However, the GM may choose to have the companion refuse orders that needlessly cause the companion to suffer, such as ordering it to stand in the campfire (without fire resistance) for no reason. Consistent abuse and being forced to act outside of its desires could, however, lead some companions to breaking their link with the caster. If this were to happen, the caster can form a link with a new companion after resting, transferring (form) talents as appropriate (or retraining them to suit, with GM permission). If the player wishes the relationship between the caster and companion to be coerced or antagonistic, consider having the companion be controlled by the GM, giving the companion more freedom to argue and interpret its orders in ways favorable to its views. Such a relationship can be especially interesting when the caster and companion have significantly opposed views. This should be discussed and agreed upon before such an independent companion is obtained. The process of forming a bond with a Conjuration sphere companion is intentionally left vague. While some companions resemble denizens of the planes, others may be less concrete in their origin. Ghosts, vestiges of cosmic powers, unformed spiritual energy, and the sheer will of the caster can all be valid sources of a companion, each offering differing methods to form a bond. Creatures tied to alignment planes may consent to the bond to increase their patron's influence in the world or to guide the caster toward their alignment and goals, potentially leaving once they feel their goals are sufficiently advanced or that the caster has gone beyond the limits of what they are willing to assist with. More ephemeral sources may simply seek an opportunity to exist in the material world, freely copying their summoner's outlook and ends for the joy of existing. Others may seek out casters whose goals align with their own to aid them, whether for grand cosmic purpose or simple revenge. Companions with a single definite purpose may wish to end the connection once the purpose is served, though they could easily see staying with their (usually mortal) summoner for longer out of obligation or fondness."

Talents marked (alter) grant you new ways to alter objects. Create [Core] As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create a non-magical, unattended object out of vegetable matter such as wood, hemp, or cotton in either your hand or an adjacent square. The object may be of equivalent size to one Small object per caster level (see chart below) and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. When creating an object you may spend an additional spell point to allow that object to persist for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. If the created object is especially large, it must begin in an adjacent square and must be completely contained within Close range. You cannot create items that require mixing, carry special properties, or knowledge you don't possess (alchemical items, rare herbs, the key to a lock you didn't create, etc.). A DC 15 Appraise check reveals the object as a magical fake. Fabricated objects have a lingering magical aura that can be detected as magic, although the objects themselves aren't magical. While simple objects such as candles, folds of cloth, simple furniture, or basic weapons are easy to create; particularly complex objects (mechanics, crossbows, objects with moving parts) require a Craft check made against the object's Craft DC. Failure means the object comes into being broken and unusable. You cannot create an object directly onto a target (summoning manacles onto someone's wrists, etc.). Notes on Walls and Coverings:  A section of 20 ft by 20 ft cloth is considered a Small object. A wall 10 ft by 10 ft and 1 inch thick counts as a Small object. Doubling the thickness counts as doubling the size.

Thus, a casing for a Medium creature is a Large object, a casing for a Large creature is a Huge object, etc. A creature is allowed a Reflex save to escape such an entrapment, and may attack or make Strength checks unimpeded against its own casing. Notes on Falling Objects:  Objects that fall upon characters deal damage based on their size according to  Table: Object Size . Objects made of stone or harder substances deal double damage, while objects such as cloth or water deal half damage. Also, an object falling less than 30 feet also deals half damage, while objects falling more than 150 ft deal double damage. These multipliers stack. A falling object takes the same amount of damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal more than 20d6 damage. Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged touch attack, with a range increment of 20 feet.

    "repair": {
      "benefits": "You may repair a damaged object, healing it a number of hit points equal to 1d4 + 1/2 your caster level. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. The Creator's Handbook \n$4.99 This ability cannot restore warped or transmuted items, but it can still repair damage done to such items."
    },
    "falling objects": {
      "benefits": "Objects that fall upon characters deal falling damage based on their size according to Table: Object Size. Objects made of stone or harder substances deal double falling damage, while soft object such as cloth deal half falling damage. An object falling less than 30 feet also deals half falling damage, while an object falling more than 150 feet deals double falling damage. These multipliers stack; a stone object falling 150 feet would deal x4 damage, while a cloth object falling 20 feet would deal 1/4th damage. A falling object takes the same amount of falling damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal more than 20d6 falling damage. Additional damage, such as through enhancements, acid coatings, etc., is not multiplied or divided by hardness or falling distance. Dropping an object on a creature is considered an attack with a ranged weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. This distance is measured from the object's starting point to the target's square, rather than the distance between you and the target. When making an attack roll with a falling object, use your Intelligence instead of your Dexterity when calculating your attack bonus. When dropping an object on a target that is larger than the dropped object, make an attack roll against their AC. This is similar to a weapon attack. When dropping an object that is the same size or larger than the target, make an attack roll against their touch AC. This is similar to using an indirect-fire siege weapon, and carries some additional rules: When using a Large or larger object like an indirect-fire siege weapon, the object targets a creature in a square, but also deals half its falling damage as splash damage to additional creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per size category above Large of the object being dropped. When using a dropped object of Medium size or larger like an indirect-fire siege engine, you may target a grid intersection instead of a creature like you can with a splash weapon, in which case direct damage is not dealt and splash damage (if any) affects creatures as normal. Also, like a splash weapon, if you miss with a dropped object, the object veers off course one space per range increment. Roll a d8 to determine the direction in which the object veered off-course, just as with a splash weapon. A dropped, hard, non-wall/covering object larger than the creatures underneath it will push creatures out of the area where it fell to the nearest unoccupied spaces, while objects the same size or smaller would themselves move to the nearest unoccupied spaces. Walls and coverings larger than the objects underneath them function as catches, described below. A dropped soft non-covering object, such as a large bundle of cloth, that is larger than the creatures underneath it neither moves creatures nor becomes a catch, and instead forces the targets to pass a Reflex save or be knocked prone and buried underneath the object itself."
    },
    "falling weapons": {
      "benefits": "Weapons deal their normal damage instead of their object size damage when dropped on a target and their damage is not multiplied for hardness, although it is still multiplied for distance. Falling weapons are never treated as indirect siege weapons, and always target AC rather than touch AC. Dropping a giant spike is the same as dropping a greatsword."
    },
    "buried": {
      "benefits": "When a target is buried in material, such as from large cloth objects as mentioned above, they suffer 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried, which becomes lethal damage when their nonlethal damage equals their hit points. A creature may clear material equal to five times their heavy load limit per minute, or per 30 seconds if using an appropriate tool such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel. The amount of stone or heavier material that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs about 1 ton (2,000 pounds), with wood and softer materials such as cloth weight half that amount. A buried character cannot unbury itself, but may attempt to free itself with a Strength check or Escape Artist check against a DC equal to 5 + the Reflex save DC they failed that buried them."
    },
    "walls and coverings": {
      "benefits": "When creating walls, coverings, or other objects that are particularly thin but cover a large area, a section of 20-foot-by-20-foot cloth is considered a Small object (1 hit point), while a wall 10-foot-by-10-foot and 1 inch thick counts as a Small object. Adding spikes or other such decorations to a 10-foot-by-10-foot wall makes it count as a Medium object, and doubling the thickness of a wall or covering counts as doubling its size. When dropping a wall or covering onto an area, damage is dealt to all spaces the wall or covering strikes, but damage is determined by the thickness, rather than the overall size, of the object (dropping a spikeless wall 1-inch thick onto a target counts as striking them with a Small object, no matter how large the wall may actually be in total). Additionally, you cannot target specific creatures with a wall or covering; only splash damage can be dealt over the affected area. Coverings made of soft materials such as cloth dropped less than 30 feet do not deal damage."
    },
    "spikes and hazardous ground": {
      "benefits": "You may create spikes on an object or the ground that deal damage to targets who run into or pass over them. If a target is pushed onto spikes (such as through a successful bull rush) or steps onto them, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half if the wound was administered to its feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it enters an area covered in spikes. A creature may move at half speed through this area without risking damage to itself. Spikes added to a dropped object do not increase the damage of the falling object, though spikes added to a wall count as increasing its size as mentioned above. When placing spikes or any other form of hazardous terrain directly underneath a target, they are allowed a Reflex saving throw. Success means they suffer no effect from the hazardous terrain in that square until the end of their next turn. Attempting to move into or through such hazardous squares affects the target normally. It is also possible, through certain talents, to create other forms of hazardous terrain, such as grease, ice, acid, or other materials. Hazardous terrain created in this fashion functions as normal for its kind."
    },
    "catches, nets, and cages": {
      "benefits": "A catch is any wall or covering larger than the target underneath it that is dropped on a target and then rests on top of them to impede their movement. A net is a catch made from cloth, rope, chains, or other pliable materials that is the same size as the target underneath it. A cage is a wall or covering that is wrapped around a target so as to impede their movement without dealing falling damage first. A net functions the same as the exotic weapon of the same name. A catch is similar to a net in that targets underneath it are entangled, but escaping a catch is as easy as moving out from underneath it, in addition to breaking it through dealing damage or making a Strength check. Cages, on the other hand, do not deal damage, but are also much harder to escape. While it is possible to box someone in with walls and a ceiling, if those walls are not at least 10 feet away from the target on all sides, the target is allowed a Reflex save to immediately move to the nearest unoccupied space on the outside of the cages. Creating a cage 1-inch thick that occupies the same space as a creature is considered the same as creating an object one size larger than the target creature. No matter how small a cage might be, a target may always make attack rolls and Strength checks unimpeded against any cage created around them (with the usual DC of 10 + the object's Hardness +1 per inch in the item's thickness), though the inside may be covered in spikes as a wall at the usual cost of increasing its effective size (or be coated in acid or other harmful materials if you possess the appropriate talents) to discourage such attacks and checks. Targets are not damaged by the material unless they make such attacks or checks. Creation Talent Types Some Creation talents are designated (alter) talents. These grant you new ways to alter objects."

    "altering burst": {
      "benefits": "You may alter all unattended non-magical objects in a 10 ft. radius around yourself. You may only affect objects half the size of your usual maximum. If you spend a spell point, you may alter objects up to your normal size limitation as per your caster level and increase the radius to 20 ft. You may choose any number of materials that you can create within this area to be affected. (For example, you may choose to destroy a stone wall while leaving the wooden dresser resting against it unharmed.) If you possess Distant Alteration, you may center this effect anywhere within range. If you possess Potent Alteration, when spending a spell point to alter bigger objects in a larger area, you may alter up to one attended and/or magical object for every 4 caster levels you possess that remains within the size limitations of the effect in addition to other objects in the area."
    },
    "created momentum": {
      "benefits": "When creating an object and dropping it on a target at the same time, the falling object never deals half damage, no matter how short the fall. Additionally, you may attack walls and other targets in this fashion, even if it would normally be impossible to drop an object on top of them, by hurling the created object sideways. The created object only needs to fall 75 ft. rather than 150 ft. to deal double damage."
    },
    "distant creation [range]": {
      "benefits": "When you create an object, you may create the object anywhere within close range, and the object needs to be completely contained within medium range. When you alter a target, you may do so with a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of close. You may select this talent multiple times. Each time it is taken, increase all of these ranges by 1 step (close to medium, medium to long)."
    },
    "divided creation [mass]": {
      "benefits": "When creating an object, you may instead create multiple objects within range. Each created object must be of the same general type (suits of armor, wall sections, catapults, etc.), and the total size of all created objects cannot exceed your maximum creation size. Alternatively, you may create a single 'object' that would normally consist of a multitude of parts (i.e., if creating a tavern with this talent, it would appear with chairs, beds, barrels, etc.). Just as two Small objects counts as a Medium object and two Medium objects counts as a Large object, two Tiny objects count as a Small object, two Diminutive objects count as a Tiny object, etc. You may drop multiple objects as an attack, but each object must target a different square (up to 4 objects that are Tiny or smaller can target a single square, but any attack roll is done once for each object). A creature may be targeted only by as many falling objects as could target any square or squares the creature occupies. Alternatively, you may attempt to drop enough small objects to bury a target, creating a cave-in or a similar effect on top of them. This deals damage as normal for a single falling object of whatever material is chosen, but also has the chance of burying the target as if the dropped material were a soft material such as cloth. Author's Note:  Creation sphere can target larger creatures with more objects than smaller ones, but this has always been viewed as an abuse of the sphere's effects for the \"sake of realism\". GMs should heavily consider limiting the number of objects which can target a single creature to 4 objects, regardless of the creatures actual size. Larger creatures should not be taking unusually larger amounts of damage than a smaller foe would under the same circumstances. GMs may consider allowing Creation sphere to use the rules as written use of Divided Creation, but treat the interaction as though it were an advanced talent, understanding that allowing this interaction greatly increases Creation sphere's damage against a single large target."

    "exquisite detail": {
      "benefits": "Items you create are more intricate, and much harder to identify as fakes. The DC 15 limitation on how high skill checks can reach is removed, allowing you to attempt skill checks of any difficulty. When making skill checks to create especially expensive and difficult objects you may use your casting ability modifier in place of your Intelligence for the Craft check, and the DC becomes 10 + 1 per 5 gp in its cost to a maximum of 50 gp, or DC 20 + 1 per 200 gp in its cost if its cost is above 50 gp. Additionally, you may add your caster level to the Appraise DC required to detect objects you create as magical fakes. Those attempting to detect magic on your created objects must attempt a magic skill check to detect any lingering creation auras."

    "instill alteration [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill an alter effect inside it, which functions as an oil. Effects that do not cost a spell point have their cost increased to 1 spell point when used in this manner. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."

    "potent alteration": {
      "benefits": "Increase the amount of damage dealt or damage healed when you use your Destroy or Repair ability to 1d6 + your caster level. When altering an object, you may spend an additional spell point to affect magical objects, attended objects, or constructs. While this means you may Repair damaged or destroyed magical items, you cannot restore the magic to such an object unless your caster level is at least equal to the item's caster level. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be Repaired in this way. If used against an attended object, this requires a touch attack, and the creature attending the object can attempt a Will save to negate. If used against an animate object, this is a touch attack but does not grant a saving throw. If the object or object's wielder is unwilling, they are also allowed a Fortitude save to halve the damage (in the case of Destroy) or otherwise negate the effect."

When attempting to disable a complex device or lock you may instead simply target the offending part of the object with destroy. You may make Disable Device checks as if it was a class skill using your caster level in place of skill ranks and your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity.

    "replication": {
      "benefits": "By spending an additional spell point when you create an object less than half of your maximum size, you may delay your creation so that rather than create a single object once, it creates a multitude of identical objects over time. The total size of all created objects cannot exceed double your create maximum size. You must set a parameter when this effect is created for when and where within range the items are created (for example, creating a new arrow in a quiver whenever the previous arrow is removed, or dropping a new anvil each round onto a target location, determined at the time of casting). This continues for the duration of the create effect or until the maximum size (or another non-standard limit) has been reached, whichever comes first. Using this talent allows the create effect to persist for 1 minute per caster level without concentration at no additional cost."

    "restrictive casing": {
      "benefits": "When attempting to create a casing for a creature, you may spend an additional spell point to create a full-body confinement casing. Treat this as an object the same size as the creature. They may still make Strength checks to escape, but are otherwise unable to attack the casing or take any action which requires movement. Additionally, you may create non-harmful objects directly on a creature. An unwilling target is always entitled a Reflex save to avoid having an object created directly on them, causing the object to fall harmlessly to the ground. (For example, you may create manacles on a target's wrists, but if they make a successful Reflex save the manacles miss and fall to the ground.) Alter Talents"

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to alter an object, changing its composition from one material to another for 1 round per caster level. Both the material you are affecting and the material you are changing it into must be materials you can create (i.e., you must possess the Expanded Materials talent to work with objects other than vegetable matter) and the object cannot exceed your maximum creation size, although you may target part of an object (such as a section of wall). When the duration expires, the object returns to its normal material, although any damage sustained while altered remains after it returns to its original material.

This is an instantaneous effect, and cannot be dispelled once finished. You can only affect materials you can create (i.e., you must possess the Expanded Materials talent to work with materials other than vegetable matter). You cause terrain in a 10-foot radius to suddenly crack and break, making the squares difficult terrain. This radius increases by 5 feet per 5 caster levels. A square can be cleared as a standard action, which provokes an attack of opportunity, or repaired with a spell or effect such as the Repair ability of the Creation sphere to no longer be difficult terrain. If a square would be made of a mineral (stone, metals, gems, etc.), the radius you may affect is reduced by half. If you possess Distant Creation, you may center this effect anywhere within range."

You can only affect materials you can create (i.e., you must possess the Expanded Materials talent to work with materials other than vegetable matter), and you may only make crude changes such as forming walls, trenches, doors, coffers and other basic shapes. Detailed work (such as forging armor) is not possible, and there is a 30% chance that anything with moving parts simply doesn't work. You may affect targets up to your normal creation size, but when working with a mineral (stone, metals, gems, etc.) the size you may affect is reduced by half."
    },
    "magnify/minimize (alter)": {
      "benefits": "You may alter an object's size for 1 minute per caster level. When using alter you may cause any object you may affect to increase or decrease by 1 size category. This doubles or halves the object's height and width and multiplies or divides its weight by 8. By spending a spell point, you can increase the number of steps you may enlarge or shrink an object by 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels (to a maximum of Colossal and a minimum of Fine). Effects which depend upon a target object's size which would not function due to size alterations are automatically suppressed, continuing to count down their duration as normal, when the object no longer meets the size requirements. Worn items affected by Magnify/Minimize impede their wearer. Magical armor and clothing made too large or small make movement difficult and treat the wearer as if they were encumbered with a heavy load. Non-magical worn equipment made too small forces the wearer to attempt a Strength check (with a +2 bonus per size category change of the equipment) against the Break DC of the object. Success destroys the object while failure results in encumbrance as if it was a magical item. Non-magical equipment made too large may encumber the target or simply fall to the ground if made 2 or more sizes too large. Other effects of similar severity may occur at the GM's discretion. If cast on a qualifying creature using Potent Alteration, the target creature gains the same adjustments as if the Size Change Alteration talent had been used on them to adjust them to the target size."
    },
    "rigidity (alter)": {
      "benefits": "You can spend one spell point to manipulate how rigid an object is. You cannot alter an object that is larger than you can create and the normal restrictions apply. This talent has no effect on gases or liquids, or creatures without hardness as a defensive ability. Increasing an object's rigidity improves its hardness by 1, but decreases its hit points by 2 (walls lose 2 hit points per inch of thickness) per two caster levels (minimum: +1), as the object's structure becomes harder, but is in turn more prone to shattering. Objects cannot be reduced to less than 1 hit point (walls cannot have less than 1 hit point/inch of thickness), and the bonuses to hardness stop when the minimum amount of hit points is reached. Decreasing an object's rigidity lowers its hardness by 1, but increases its hit points by 2 (walls gain 2 hit points per inch of thickness) per two caster levels (minimum: -1), as the object's structure becomes more flexible, but it is no longer as able to resist damage as the original. Objects cannot be reduced to a hardness lower than 0, and the bonuses to hit points stop when the minimum hardness is reached. This effects lasts for one minute per caster level for altered objects, or for the full duration of created objects, whichever is shorter."

    "transparency (alter)": {
      "benefits": "You may convert any material into a more transparent version of itself as long as you concentrate for up to 1 minute per caster level, but you may always spend a spell point to allow the effect to remain without concentration for its maximum duration. This does not affect the object's composition, hardness, or have any effect other than offer a clear view through the object. The object may be of any size of which you can create or, if larger, may be as large as a two square ft. per caster level that can penetrate up to 1 ft. of material per caster level. The caster may choose to affect the object's opacity in a way that allows peering through an object while remaining unobserved from the other side. When used in this way, Perception checks through the object suffer a -4 penalty, but it requires a DC 15 Perception check to notice that the object is see through from the other side. If you possess Exquisite Detail, the penalty to Perception decreases to -2 and the Perception DC to notice that the object is transparent increases by your caster level.

    "acidic creation (material)": {
      "benefits": "By spending an additional spell point when you create an object, you may work with material with basic acidic properties. You may create acidic liquids (3 cubic feet equals a Small object, and is enough to cover a 5-foot square). If used to coat an object, this deals 1d6 acid damage per round to any target that is touching the object. If used to coat the ground, this counts as a form of hazardous terrain, and deals 1d6 acid damage per 5 feet of movement a creature makes across the affected ground. If applied to an object that is dropped on a target or used to make attacks, this deals +1d6 acid damage. You may coat an object in acid with the same action used to create that object. When creating acid, you may attempt to spray or drop the acid in a way that covers a target. Attempting to cover a target in acid requires acid equal to the target's size, or double if you wish to spray both the target and cover the ground underneath it. Targets may attempt a Reflex save to avoid being covered in acid, and if they fail, suffer 1d6 acid damage +1d6 per 2 caster levels, per round. Targets may attempt one new Reflex save every round as a move action to clean away the acid and end the effect. They may also clear away the acid as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity without requiring a saving throw. Acid loses its potency and deals only minimum damage after 1 round per caster level. If you possess Lengthened Creation, this improves to 10 minutes per caster level. If you possess Gaseous Generation you may create acidic gases. These follow the rules of Gaseous Generation for determining volume, but at half the normal size. This acidic gas deals 1d6 acid damage per round, and an additional 1d6 damage for every four caster levels beyond 1st. When an acidic gas loses its potency it is dispersed entirely."

    "alchemical creation (material)": {
      "benefits": "You may create items that require processing, such as alchemical items and poisons. You may spend 1 spell point to create an alchemical item or poison worth up to 25 gp per caster level. This functions exactly as the normal alchemical item or poison, except that any DC is 10 + your casting ability modifier + 1/2 your caster level and any hit point damage it deals is increased by your casting ability modifier. These alchemical items or poisons remain for the normal duration of a created object, at which point they disappear as usual (but any effects inflicted on creatures or objects remain). You may also alter mundane alchemical items or poisons up to a maximum value of 25 gp per caster level, enhancing their potency in the same way for the normal duration, at which point the items return to their normal damage and saving throw DC. This does not stack with other effects that increase the item's DC. At 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter, the total value you may alter or create increases by an additional 25 gp per caster level, according to Table: Alchemical Creation. If you possess Divided Creation, you may create any number of alchemical items or poisons whose total value is no more than half the maximum value you may create and whose total size is less than or equal to your maximum size (with each alchemical item or poison counting as a Small object), but only one object created this way increases its saving throw DC and damage. All others retain their base, non-magical statistics. If you possess Plasma Production, then any time you create an alchemical weapon that includes a fuse as the method of activating it (such as with a fuse grenade and its variants, or fireworks), you may create it with the fuse pre-lit. This allows you to treat the weapon as if you had used it as provided in its description. (For example, creating a fuse grenade with this option causes the grenade to explode in 1d4 rounds.) You cannot create or alter poisons or formulae from the Alchemy sphere (see Spheres of Might), as those mixtures are simply too unstable.

    "expanded materials (material)": {
      "benefits": "When you create an object, you may work with any non-harmful material with a hardness of 5 or less, including glass, ice, or leather. You may create water (3 cubic feet equals a Small object), but not gases or flesh. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to steadily make more materials, as detailed in the table below. When creating objects made from stone, gems, or metal, double the maximum weight per size category of the objects you can create. Note:  Objects of stone or harder materials deal double damage when dropped on a target.

    "gaseous generation (material)": {
      "benefits": "By spending a spell point when you alter or create an object, you may work with gaseous materials. You may create gases or change their composition into any other known substance with Change Material. A 5-foot cube equals a Medium object. Half a cube equals a Small object, but this decreases the DC of any created gaseous effect by 2 and halves any damage from harmful gases for any creature within that space. You must have line of sight to accomplish this, and as such cannot alter the air in a creature's lungs or other, similar situations. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make more dangerous gases as detailed in the table below. Vacuums cannot be altered or created, and gases cannot be destroyed by damaging effects. Creatures standing in a square filled with unbreathable air must hold their breath or suffer the effects of suffocation, following the normal rules for doing so. A half-filled square of non-transparent gas obscures sight beyond 10 feet. Any creature behind more than 10 feet of squares half-filled with a gas has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). A square filled with a gas obscures sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment and creatures further away have total concealment (50% miss chance and attackers cannot use sight to locate the target). If a square is filled with a condensed gas (by treating a single square as a Large object) it obscures vision as above and is difficult to move in, halving movement speed of all creatures within it as well as imposing a -2 penalty to melee attack and damage rolls, preventing normal ranged attacks (siege weapons and magic attacks function normally), and treats anyone standing in a harmful gas as if they were exposed to it twice. (For example, taking double damage from acidic vapors, or two doses of poison from poisonous fumes.) A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses any altered or created gas in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gas in 1 round. Note:  The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed to be a perfect simulation of reality, and attempting to interject real-world physics and chemistry into it is often disastrous. As such, the gases that may be altered or created have been simplified from what their real world counterparts would be. If you wish to create a more specific gas, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with your GM - its effects should not exceed those of the gases normally available at your caster level.

    "object of force (material)": {
      "benefits": "You may create solid objects made of force energy. Any solid object (such as something that could be created from wood) can be created out of force, but objects made from force have no weight (see the Lighten talent from the Enhancement sphere), however, if you choose you may 'anchor' an object of force, cause it to become immovable from the place it was created, even floating in the air. If broken through damage or a successful Strength check, objects of force immediately disappear. Objects of force stop the movement of incorporeal creatures and can be used to harm them and other creatures vulnerable to force effects. Objects of force possess 10 hit points per inch and a hardness equal to your caster level. An object of force can be any one color and is translucent but easily noticeable, and require no Perception check to see while imparting a -2 penalty to Perception checks to see through them. If you possess Transparency you may make the object invisible (requiring a Perception check to detect with a DC equal to 10 + their size modifier + your caster level) or entirely opaque without spending an additional spell point, chosen at the time of its creation. Author's Note:  Creation sphere effects made with this talent have the force descriptor."

    "plasma production (material)": {
      "benefits": "You may alter or create non-magical fires with your normal limitations on size, as if it were an object. When creating objects, you may create the object already on fire. Flaming objects deal 1d6 fire damage to any creature who touches the object, such as by having it dropped on them or used as a weapon against them. You may also light the terrain on fire or summon burning materials as a form of hazardous terrain. This behaves and deals damage as a fire created by the Nature sphere instead of as normal for hazardous terrain. A fire that has insufficient fuel quickly burns itself out if not maintained through concentration. In addition, you may spend a spell point to create non-magical electricity. However, with no battery or other way to store electricity, the energy quickly dissipates. Electricity must be generated directly on a creature or object (not simply in a square) and instead of being calculated by size, is instead calculated by its charge, with 1 charge being equal to a Medium object. If used on a battery or other electrical storage object, the charges are stored safely. If used on any other creature or object, it instead deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per charge to the creature or object (Reflex negates). If the creature or object is made from a conductive material such as flesh or metal, targets touching the electrified creature or object (including touching the same body of water) are also affected, but the electricity loses 1d6 for every 10 feet the electricity must travel to reach these targets from the specific square designated as the center of the electricity (for example, if electrocuting a metal floor, all targets touching the floor would be affected, so long as they are close enough the damage is not reduced to 0). The charge deals damage again each round at the beginning of your turn, with the charge reducing by 1 each round. If affecting a creature or their attended objects, they may ground themselves or the object as a move action, harmlessly dissipating any charges that remain. Creating electricity is an instantaneous effect, and you cannot create an object charged with electricity as you can create an object on fire. Repairing plasma restores it to the size (for fire) or stored energy (for electricity) it had in the previous round. This allows a fire to retain its size indefinitely without fuel so long as it is repaired every round. Destroying a plasma reduces its size or stored energy by 1 size category or 1d6 points of damage for every 5 points of damage dealt to it. If you use Change Material to turn an object into a plasma which dissipates entirely before the duration expires, then the object is destroyed when it regains its normal form. Otherwise, when the duration expires, the object reverts to its previous form with no apparent difference or damage that was not preexisting. Advanced Creation Talents Advanced talents are part of an optional rule and are only available with GM permission."

    "corp criadhach [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Creation sphere (Duplicate (advanced), Fleshcraft (advanced, material)), caster level 10th. \nWhen you use Duplicate to create a replica of a creature (which may only be an unliving body resembling the creature if you do not possess the Bestow Life advanced talent), you may spend a spell point to create a sympathetic link with the creature that the duplicate is modelled after. This link may take one of the two following forms. Redoubled Pain:  Whenever the duplicate takes damage from any source, the original person takes an equal amount of damage unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. In addition, when you use a magic sphere ability, you may target the duplicate to affect the creature it was made from, allowing you to affect them regardless of distance or line of sight. The sympathetic link makes the creature immediately aware of the incoming effect and allows them to defend against it without being surprised, even if asleep, though they are not made aware of the magic's precise nature or source. The creature is allowed a Fortitude save to negate the effect regardless of whether the effect would normally allow a save. After conveying magic 1 + 1 time per 10 caster levels, the duplicate crumbles and becomes useless. The first time that such a Fortitude save against this ability succeeds (regardless of if damage or a magic effect is applied), the original creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This link does not function across planes. Whenever a creature is affected by this ability, they know the general direction towards their duplicate. \n There Can Be Only One:  If the duplicate and the original creature come into physical contact with each other (which can occur when a successful touch attack is made by the duplicate or using the duplicate), the duplicate is instantly destroyed and the original creature takes 1d8 points of untyped damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half)."

    "costly creation": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Creation sphere (Expanded Materials (material), Lengthened Creation; (Change Material (alter), Forge (alter), Permanent Change (advanced)) or Create Materials (advanced)), caster level 15th. You may spend 5 additional spell points when using Create Materials or Permanent Change to permanently create valuable raw materials, including gems, precious metals (such as gold or silver), and rare metals (such as cold iron or mithral). When using this talent your caster level is halved for determining the quantity of material that can be created. Note:  This talent can be unbalancing for a game, and GMs should consider its role in their setting before allowing it to fall into player hands. However, if handled correctly, this talent can lead to interesting interactions between players and setting. For example, the players might flood a market with rare jewels only to find their value plummets as the market floods. This applies to the selling of a mass amount of mithral or adamantine as well. Also remember that towns have a maximum buy value and attempting to sell items that exceed this value cannot be done. Additionally take note of how this talent could affect the world at large outside of PC hands. If many high level Creation casters exist, then normally rare materials might be commonplace in the setting, their rarity long since diminished by industrious casters, or perhaps the materials are not naturally occurring at all and the few mages with the ability to create them charge a fortune for their use, keeping their prices high. This ultimate secret of Creation might even be passed down only among those of a certain order, limiting the talent's availability to a select few, like medieval guilds, with well guarded, secret recipes whose methods could be lost."

You cannot create complex items, i.e., you may create walls, battlements, ramps, or domes, but cannot create catapults, armor, or a complete building in this manner, although the material may be crafted as any other material after it is summoned. If you possess the Fabricate advanced talent, you may permanently create any object you could normally create, provided you succeed on an appropriate Craft check first.

This statue may be any size you choose, to a maximum of the largest object size you could create. An object created this way is still a statue, and while details can be as close to accurate as possible, the object is not mistaken for a real creature without additional disguises. When you enhance a target using the Bestow Intelligence talent to grant an object intelligence, you may spend an additional spell point to grant the target object an imprinted duplicate of your mind. The target gains all your mental traits and quirks, such as your memories and mannerisms. This allows the target to use either its normal skill ranks and modifiers, if it possesses any, or your skill ranks and modifiers, whichever is better. The target does not gain any other abilities because of this effect.

The ability does not deal damage and instead simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. When targeting an attended non-magical object, magical object, or creature (by spending an additional spell point via Potent Alteration), you may spend another spell point to reduce the target to its component parts. The target is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw. Failure results in the target taking 2d6 points of damage per caster level that bypasses all hardness, resistances, and damage reduction. A successful save reduces this damage to the normal damage of the Potent Alteration talent. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated."

    "duplicate": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Creation sphere (Exquisite Detail), caster level 5th. You may touch a single object and, as a full-round action, create a perfect duplicate of the object either in your hand or an adjacent square. The object is an exact replica in every way, and the only way to tell the object is not the original is the lingering Creation aura surrounding the object. You must be able to create all of the materials included in its construction, otherwise the object created is crafted from materials you can create and colored to appear like the original, which could give away the ruse. Magical items duplicated are always non-magical but otherwise flawless imitations. If you possess Create Materials, you may spend an additional 2 spell points to duplicate the object as an instantaneous effect, in which case it has no lingering Creation aura. If you possess the Fleshcraft and Bestow Life advanced talents, you may create a duplicate of a target creature. This duplicate appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real creature's levels or Hit Dice (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or Hit Dice). You must attempt a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is (you may use your caster level in place of your ranks in Disguise). If you possess Exquisite Detail you may add your caster level as a bonus to this check, even if you use your caster level in place of your ranks in Disguise. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check to get a hunch something is wrong. The duplicate creature is not under your control, though it recognizes you are its creator and functions as a faithful companion, as described under the Bestow Life talent. Creating a duplicate in this manner costs 1 spell point + 1 additional spell point for every 3 Hit Dice of the duplicate creature and you may not create a duplicate of a creature with more Hit Dice than your caster level. These duplicates are incapable of growing in power, but otherwise age as normal (if made permanent with Create Materials). No magical effects affecting the target are duplicated."

While you may craft from flesh (hardness 0, 2 hit points per inch) and bone (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch) as you might any other material, this also means you can create the body of a creature. Created bodies are not alive, and you must attempt a Disguise check if attempting to create a copy of a specific individual. You may also alter a body, although you must spend an additional spell point to alter a living creature (Fortitude negates). You may create a permanent body through the Create Materials talent. If used in conjunction with the Change Material talent to affect a living creature, this does not kill the target; however, they do not appear to be alive for effects that would detect such things, and they may be injured as any other object. When returned to normal the creature is still alive (provided they were not destroyed in this alternate form), but any injuries or deformities gained in their altered state carry over to their original forms. If you possess the Forge talent, you may sculpt a creature's body in one of the following ways: You can remove or restore an arm, leg, or tail. While technically you can add a limb to a creature that was not missing one, these extra limbs are too weak to hold things or be used to attack. \n You may remove or restore a sense: sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell. \n You may attack the target's body, dealing 2d6 Constitution damage. \n If you possess the Fabricate advanced talent, you may change a creature's appearance permanently.

    "destructive counter (combat)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Creation sphere (any (material) talent). Benefit:  When targeted by a ranged attack or spell effect that originates from another square (such as a destructive blast but not a vortex from (water) geomancing), or being in a square that such an effect passes through (such as an Energy Sphere destructive blast), you may attempt to destroy the projectile or spell effect as an immediate action by spending 1 spell point (this spell point cost can not be reduced in any way). If the attack is a projectile, it functions as normal unless it loses half or more of its hit points and gains the broken condition, suffering the usual effects, or is destroyed at which point it deals no damage. If the target is a spell effect of a material you can affect with your alter ability (for example, a fire damage destructive blast with Plasma Production, or a dropped stone object with Expanded Materials) you may attempt to damage the spell effect. You must succeed at a magic skill check against the caster in question. If you succeed then the targeted effect is damaged. Reduce the damage the spell effect would deal by 1d6 per caster level (increasing to 1d8 per caster level plus your casting ability modifier if you possess Potent Alteration). If this would reduce the spell's damage to 0, the effect ends when it reaches your square. If the targeted spell deals no damage, instead lower any save DC it might have by your casting ability modifier. If this would reduce the save DC to 9 or lower, the effect ends when it reaches your square. Any effect that would occur in or beyond your square is negated while any square the effect passed through prior to yours is affected normally."

Benefit:  When creating an object with either the Creation sphere or the Shadowstuff Armament feat, you may enhance the object with one enhancement you possess as part of the same action. You may concentrate on maintaining the enhancement and the creation as part of the same action. Any enhancement that would increase attack or damage also increases the attack roll and damage roll of the object if dropped on a target.

As part of altering or creating an object, you may spend a spell point to cause any object you alter or create to explode either when it hits a target for the first time (if used to make an attack), when it takes damage for the first time, or when the spell effect ends. This explosion deals damage as your destructive blast with the Explosive Orb shape, and you may treat it as a normal Explosive Orb for any effects, talents or feats interacting with destructive blasts. You may choose whether or not the altered or created object takes damage from the Explosive Orb. The object remains fissile for as long as the alter or create effect lasts. You may only have one fissile creation active at a time, plus an additional fissile creation for every 10 caster levels you possess. If you exceed the limit, one fissile creation of your choosing ends immediately. If two fissile creations explode during the same round, creatures in the overlapped area suffer diminished results from every fissile creation after the first one, dealing only 1d6 additional damage, +1d6 per 5 caster levels for each overlapping creation."

    "alchemical creation": {
      "benefits": "You may create items that require mixing, such as alchemical items and poisons. You may spend 1 spell point to create an alchemical item(up to a maximum value of 25 gp per caster level). This functions exactly as the normal alchemical item except that any DC is 10 + your casting ability modifier + 1/2 your caster level and any damage it deals is increased by your casting ability modifier. These alchemical weapons remain for the normal duration of a created object at which point they disappear as usual. You may also alter mundane alchemical weapons up to a maximum value of 25 gp, enhancing their potency in the same way for the normal duration, at which point the items return to their normal damage and saving throw DC. This does not stack with other effects that increase the item's DC. As your caster level increases, so does your ability to create and sustain more materials. At caster level 5 you may create alchemical items costing up to an additional 25 gp per caster level (a total of 50 gp per caster level). Every 5 caster levels beyond this increases the total value you can create by an additional 25 gp per caster level (75 gp per caster level at 10th, 100 gp per caster level at 15th, and so on). If you possess Divided Creation you may create any number of alchemical weapons whose total value is less than half the maximum value you may create and whose total size is less than or equal to your maximum size (with each alchemical weapon counting as a small object) but only one object created this way increases its saving throw DC and damage, all others retain their base, non-magical statistics. If you possess Plasma Production then any time you create an alchemical weapon that includes a fuse as the method of activating it (such as with a fuse grenade and its variants, or fireworks) you may create it with the fuse pre-lit. This allows you to treat the weapon as if you had used it as provided in its description. (For example, creating a fuse grenade with this option causes the grenade to explode in 1d4 rounds.)"

    "distant alteration": {
      "benefits": "You gain the ability to alter objects at range. When using alter you may instead make a ranged touch attack at a valid target within close range instead of a touch attack.

    },
    "divided creation [core]": {

Each created object must be of the same general type (suits of armor, wall sections, catapults, etc.), and the object's total size cannot exceed your maximum creation size. Alternately, you may create a single 'object' that would normally consist of a multitude of parts (i.e., if creating a tavern with this talent, it would appear with chairs, beds, barrels, etc.)."
    },
    "expanded materials [core]": {
      "benefits": "When you take this talent, you may choose one of the following options. You may take this talent multiple times. Each time, choose another option you haven't taken yet. Classic Substances:  When you create or alter an object, you may work with any non-harmful material with a hardness of 5 or less, including glass, ice, or leather. You may create water (3 cubic ft. equals a Small creature), but not gases or flesh. You may make objects with multiple materials, provided you can create all the materials required. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make steadily more materials, as detailed in the table below. Adamantine cannot be created or altered, except for the repair and destroy abilities. Note:  Objects of stone or harder materials deal double damage when dropped on a target. Note:  Feats and advanced talents found in Spheres of Power which refer to Expanded Materials now refer to Expanded Materials: Classic Substances. Table: Classic Substances Caster Level \n Materials \n \n \n 1st \n Stone \n \n \n 5th \n Basic metals (copper, iron, steel) \n \n \n 10th \n Precious metals (gold, silver) \n \n \n 15th \n Specialty metals (cold iron, mithril), gems Acidic Creation:  By spending an additional spell point when you create or alter an object, you may work with material with basic acidic properties. You may create acidic liquids (3 cubic ft. equals a Small creature) or apply an acid coating to a solid object, but may not create gases without Gaseous Generation. When first created, this acid deals 1d6 points of acid damage to any creature or object it touches every round plus 1d6 per 2 caster levels beyond 1st. After 1 round per 2 caster levels the acid will lose potency and only deals its minimum damage. If attached to an object dropped on a target, acid damage is never increased for hardness or distance. If the acid is created in a way that it would immediately harm a creature, they are entitled to a Reflex saving throw to negate the damage (unless the acid is attached to a target dropped onto them, in which case an attack roll is made as usual). If they fail this saving throw and are coated in acid, they may continue to make Reflex saves every round as a move action to clean away the affected areas and prevent further damage. By spending a fullround action that provokes an attack of opportunity they may remove the acid without a saving throw. If you possess Gaseous Generation you may create acidic gases. These follow the rules of Gaseous Generation for determining volume but at 1/2 your normal caster level. This acidic gas deals 1d6 acid damage per round, and an additional 1d6 damage for every four caster levels beyond 1st. When an acidic gas loses its potency it is dispersed entirely. If you possess Lengthened Creation, any acid created using it maintains its potency for 10 minutes per caster level. If you create acid with the Create Materials advanced talent, the acid loses its potency after one week if not refreshed by repeated castings of Create Materials. Gaseous Generation:  By spending a spell point when you create or alter an object, you may work with gaseous materials. You may create gases (5 cubic ft. equals a Medium creature, you may fill a 5 ft. square for every two caster levels. You may fill only half of a cube as a Small creature but this decreases the DC of any created gaseous effect by 2 and halves any damage from harmful gases) or change their composition into any other known substance with Change Material. You must have line of sight to accomplish this, and as such cannot alter the air in a creature's lungs into stone. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make more dangerous gases as detailed in the table below. Vacuums cannot be created or altered, and gases cannot be destroyed by damaging effects. Creatures standing in a square filled with unbreathable air must hold their breath or suffer the effects of suffocation, following the normal rules for doing so. A half-filled square of non-transparent gas obscures sight beyond 10 feet. Any creature behind more than 10 ft. of squares half-filled with a gas has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). A square filled with a gas obscures sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 ft. has concealment and creatures further away have total concealment (50% miss chance and attackers cannot use sight to locate the target). If a square is filled with a condensed gas (by treating a single square as a Large object) it obscures vision as above and is difficult to move in, halving movement speed of all creatures within it as well as imposing a -2 penalty to melee attack and damage rolls, preventing normal ranged attacks (siege weapons and magic attacks function normally), and treats anyone standing in a harmful gas as if they were exposed to it twice. (For example, taking double damage from acidic vapors, or two doses of poison from poisonous fumes.) A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses any created or altered gas in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gas in 1 round. Note:  The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed to be a perfect simulation of reality, and attempting to interject real-world physics and chemistry into it is often disastrous. As such, the gases that may be altered or created have been simplified from what their real world counterparts would be. If you wish to create a more specific gas, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with your GM - its effects should not exceed those of the gases normally available at your caster level. Table: Gaseous Generation Caster Level \n Gaseous Material \n \n \n 1st \n Breathable air \n \n \n 5th \n Unbreathable air, gaseous forms of non-harmful objects (for example, steam, smoke) \n \n \n 10th \n Non-magical inhaled poisons (using your sphere DC rather than the standard poison DC) \n \n \n 15th \n Highly flammable gases (1d6 fire damage per ignited 5 ft. cube of gas to all targets within a 20 ft. radius of any ignited cube, Ref half), highly corrosive gases (2d6 acid damage per round of exposure, Fort half) Plasma Production:  You may create or alter a non-magical fire with your normal limitations on size. A fire that has insufficient fuel quickly burns itself out. In addition, you may create or alter non-magical electricity. With no battery or other way to store electricity, however, the energy quickly dissipates. Generating electricity on an object deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels to the object and any creature or object that interacts with it (Reflex negates). Every round thereafter, the electricity deals 1d6 fewer points of damage until it reaches 0, at which point it dissipates entirely. If used on a battery or other electrical storage object, this deals no damage and creates a number of charges equal to the number of dice used for the initial damage. Repairing a plasma restores it to the size (for fire) or stored energy (for electricity) it had in the previous round. This allows a fire to retain its size indefinitely without fuel so long as it is repaired every round. Destroying a plasma reduces its size or stored energy by 1 size category or 1d6 points of damage for every 5 points of damage dealt to it. If you use Change Material to turn an object into a plasma which dissipates entirely before the duration expires, then the object is destroyed when it regains its normal form. Otherwise, when the duration expires, the object reverts to its previous form with no apparent difference or damage that wasn't preexisting."

      "benefits": "You may alter an object's size for 1 minute per caster level. When using alter you may cause any object you may affect to increase or decrease by 1 size category. This doubles or halves the object's height and width and multiplies or divides its weight by 8. By spending a spell point, you can increase the number of steps you may enlarge or shrink an object by 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels (to a maximum of Colossal and a minimum of Fine). If you have Lengthened Creation, you may spend an additional spell point to alter the object for up to 1 day per caster level. Effects which depend upon a target object's size which would not function due to size alterations are automatically suppressed, continuing to count down their duration as normal, when the object no longer meets the size requirements. Worn items affected by Magnify/Minimize impede their wearer. Magical armor and clothing made too large or small make movement difficult and treat the wearer as if they were encumbered. Non-magical worn equipment made too small forces the wearer to make a Strength check (with a +2 bonus per size category) against the break DC of the object. Success destroys the object while failure results in encumbrance as if it was a magical item. Non-magical equipment made too large may encumber the target or simply fall to the ground at GM discretion. Other effects of similar severity may occur at the GM's discretion. If cast on a creature using Potent Alteration the target creature gains the same adjustments as if the Size Change Alteration talent had been used on them to adjust them to the target size."

    "object of force": {
      "benefits": "You may create objects made of solid force energy. Force objects have no weight and prevent incorporeal creatures from passing through them. Force objects have hardness equal to two times your caster level and hp equal to 10 times your caster level per inch. A wall 5 ft. by 5 ft., 1 in. thick of force is treated as a Small object. If you possess Wall Master you may instead treat a 10 ft. by 10 ft., 1 in. or a 5 ft. by 5 ft., 4 in. thick wall of force as a Small object. Objects of force are translucent but easily noticeable and require no Perception check to see while imparting a -2 penalty to Perception checks to see through them. If you possess Transparency you may make the object invisible (as Illusion sphere's Invisibility using your Creation caster level) or entirely opaque without spending an additional spell point, chosen at the time of its creation."
    },
    "potent alteration [core]": {
      "benefits": "When altering an object, you may spend an additional spell point to affect magical objects, attended objects, or animate targets such as golems. While this means you may repair broken magical items with your repair ability, you cannot restore the magic to such an object unless your caster level is at least equal to the item's caster level. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. If used against an attended object, this is treated as a sunder maneuver. If used against an animate object, this is a touch attack. If the object or object's wielder is unwilling, they are also allowed a Fortitude save to halve the damage (in the case of destroy) or otherwise negate the effect."
    },
    "change material (alter) [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to alter an object, changing its composition from one material to another for 1 round per caster level. Both the material you are affecting and the material you are changing it into must be materials you can create (i.e., you must possess the Expanded Materials talent to work with objects other than vegetable matter) and the object cannot exceed your maximum creation size, although you may target part of an object (such as a section of wall). When the duration expires, the object returns to its normal material, although any damage sustained while altered remains after it returns to its original material. You cannot change a liquid into a solid or a solid into a liquid, and you cannot create or affect gases."

    "what exactly can you create?": {
      "benefits": "The Creation rules listed in Spheres of Power gives the following definition of what cannot be created: \"You cannot create items that require mixing, carry special properties, or knowledge you don't possess (alchemical items, rare herbs, the key to a lock you didn't create, etc.).\" This clause is intended to prevent a Creation sphere user from simply conjuring a legendary herb from nothing and negating an entire quest line or creating free versions of otherwise costly alchemical weapons, but otherwise leaves much up to GM fiat when deciding what can or cannot be created. In order to clarify what exactly can and can't be created, please see the following expanded definition: \"You normally cannot create alchemical concoctions, poisons, or materials that deal damage on contact. Treat creating items with unique properties like creating complex items. Special, non-magical herbs and plants, such as wolfsbane, or the night tea plant, can be created by making an appropriate Knowledge (nature), Profession (botany), or similar skill check, subject to GM discretion, as long as the DC does not exceed 15. More common or simple things require no skill check. Similarly, creating items that require specific knowledge can be done if you have the relevant knowledge, so long as the DC does not exceed 15. You may even attempt to gain this knowledge as part of the create attempt in certain circumstances, for example, you may try to create a key to a specific lock by making a Disable Device check at the lock's DC at the time of casting. If you possess Exquisite Detail, you may create rarer and more unique materials, removing the DC 15 limitation on skill checks to create such objects. The bonus granted by Exquisite Detail does not apply to these checks but is added to the DC of Appraise checks to notice that they are magically created.\" It is recommended that for simple things, like the wolfsbane herb, the skill DC be set to a base of 10, +1 for every 5 gp of the item's price until DC 20. Items which normally cost more than 50 gp should instead have a DC 20 +1 for every 200 gp of its base price. These DCs are subject to GM discretion and should be revised as necessary. Intrinsically magical materials, that is to say materials which qualify as magical items, can never be created.\""
    },
    "anchoring objects": {
      "benefits": "When creating objects you may choose to have the object stand alone, able to be moved or fall over normally, or anchor it to an adjacent, unattended object. In this way you could create a bridge anchored into two sides of a canyon, iron bars anchored into a castle hall, or a nice dinner that can't be easily separated from its table. Separating a creation anchored to another object requires a Strength check with a DC equal to the break DC of the weaker object."
    },
    "creation and artifacts": {
      "benefits": "Artifacts are incredibly powerful magical objects, and as such, even with Potent Alteration, are difficult to affect. Minor artifacts can be damaged as normal by destroy, but they cannot be destroyed nor can their form be changed. Major artifacts are entirely immune to the Creation sphere effects unless the conditions for their destruction have been met."
    },
    "creation and dismissal": {
      "benefits": "When maintaining a creation through concentration, dismissing the object is as simple as ceasing to concentrate. When a created object is maintained through any other means, it may be dismissed as a standard action as if it were a spell with a duration marked with (D) with the exception of instantaneous creations which persist without continued access to magic and cannot be dismissed. When dismissing objects created with Divided Creation you may dismiss any number of them with the same action."

    "creating multiple falling objects": {
      "benefits": "When using Divided Creation to create a multitude of objects, each may be created in a single square so long as there is space for them. When dropping objects, however, each must be targeted at a different square (unless the objects are Tiny or smaller, in which case up to 4 may target a single square). A creature may be targeted only by as many falling objects as could target any square(s) the creature occupies (a Medium creature can only be targeted by 1 Small or larger object, a Huge creature by up to 9, etc.)."
    },
    "creating slippery or dangerous terrain": {
      "benefits": "Although you cannot create objects directly onto a target, you can create objects immediately around them. This includes creating materials directly underneath a target's feet. If you create a hazardous substance directly under a creature such as grease, ice, or acid, the creature is automatically entitled a Reflex saving throw using the same saving throw DC as the save to avoid being encased. Success indicates that they suffer no effect from the hazardous terrain in that square until the end of their next turn (attempting to move into or through other hazardous squares affects the target normally). Failure results in the target taking damage or falling prone as appropriate. Hazardous terrain created in this fashion functions as normal for its kind. For example, ice allows movement at half-speed without penalty but moving at greater than half-speed requires a DC 15 acrobatics check (increasing to DC 20 to run or charge), failure results in falling prone, while success by more than 5 allows you to move an additional 10 ft., but leaves you flat-footed regardless of success or failure until your next turn."
    },
    "creating very small objects": {
      "benefits": "When creating items smaller than Small size, you can make more of them than normal. You may make 2 Tiny objects, 4 Diminutive objects, or 8 Fine objects in place of a single Small object. This does not allow the creation of multiple objects with a single usage of create without Divided Creation or a similar ability."
    },
    "dropping objects": {
      "benefits": "Dropping an object on a creature via the Creation sphere is similar to dropping an object on a creature via a catapult or trebuchet. The following rules are appropriate when handling falling objects. Additional damage such as enhancements bonuses, acid coatings, etc., do not have their damage multiplied or divided by hardness or falling distance. When dropping an object on a target that is at least two sizes bigger than the object, the falling object targets normal AC rather than touch AC. When dropping an object on a target that is no more than one size bigger than the object, the falling object behaves in many ways like a splash weapon, as explained below. In this case, the falling object targets touch AC. When dropping a Large object, the object deals half damage as 'splash damage' to all targets within 5 ft. of the target space (Reflex save negates). This radius increases by 5 ft. for every size category above Large for the falling object. You may target a square instead of a creature (provided the creature inside that square is not at least two sizes bigger than the object), in which case the object deals splash damage to any creature inside that square as well (Reflex negates). If the falling object misses the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the attack, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the caster), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the drop. After determining where the object landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures within the attack area. Creatures 3 or more sizes smaller than the object that fail their saving throw against a falling object's splash damage become buried under the object or its rubble. Treat this as a cave-in with the following adjustments; Buried creatures are pinned, prone, and have full cover so long as they remained buried. As a standard action, a buried creature can attempt to free himself with a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 30 Escape Artist check. Failure by 4 or less reduces cover by 1 step and the DCs by 2. Failure by 5 or more undoes progress, increasing the DCs by 2 but does not restore cover. Each failure stacks. Characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a character falls unconscious, he must make a DC 15 Constitution check each minute. If it fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute until freed or dead. Creatures who have less than improved cover are not buried and have no risk of suffocation but are still pinned until they dig themselves out or are rescued. Characters who aren't buried can dig out their friends. They may make a Strength check as a standard action against a buried target's DC, with the same results on a failure. Alternatively, they may attempt to clear stone slowly and carefully. In 1 minute, using only her hands, a character can clear rocks and debris equal to five times her heavy load limit. The amount of loose stone that fills a 5-ft.-by-5-ft. area weighs 1 ton (2,000 pounds). Armed with an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel, a digger can clear loose stone twice as quickly as by hand."

An area filled with normal or bright light from a glow effect is no longer considered an area of darkness for Dark sphere abilities. Meld Melds are effects that can be granted to a creature that alter the way they interact with darkness.

Blots do not affect the light level of the area. Only one (blot) talent may be applied to an individual blot, and a single darkness effect cannot be affected by both a (blot) and (darkness) talent at the same time, but blots and darknesses with different effects may overlap. Individual blots do not stack with themselves, nor do they stack with similar (darkness) talents. If a talent is labeled as (blot) and (darkness), the caster may decide which tag to use when applying the talent to an area of darkness.

Only one (shadow) talent may be applied to any one target at a time, and an unwilling target is allowed a Will save to negate a shadow. The duration of each shadow is specified in its description. If a shadow can be maintained through concentration, you must remain within your shadow range of the target to do so. Shadows function normally within areas of glows, neither suppressing nor being suppressed by areas of glows simply by entering them. If a glow and shadow are cast directly upon the same target, however, the caster of the second effect must attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of the first effect's caster. If the check succeeds, the second effect functions normally and the first effect is suppressed. Time spent suppressed counts against the duration of the effect in either case. Dark Talents"
    },
    "clinging darkness": {
      "benefits": "You may center an area of darkness or blot on a creature or item rather than an area. If targeting a creature or its attended item, that creature may attempt a Will save to negate the effect initially and again each round at the end of its turn. A successful save ends the darkness or blot immediately."
    },
    "dampen light": {
      "benefits": "You can dampen light in an area. This functions similarly to creating darkness, using the same range and area, but it lasts for 1 minute per caster level without the need for concentration and only lowers light levels by one step within the area. In addition, you cannot apply (darkness) talents to these areas, though (meld) talents function within them as if they were an area of darkness. You may also apply talents that would change the area or duration of your darkness (such as Greater Darkness or Eternal Darkness) to use of this talent. You may take this talent twice; when taken a second time, you may choose to lower light levels by two steps when you use this talent."
    },
    "dappled shadows": {
      "benefits": "You may reduce the radius of your darkness or blot in 5 feet increments to create a second area of darkness or blot with a radius equal to the subtracted amount. You may do this multiple times to create multiple areas of darkness or blot. These spheres may be placed anywhere within your range that you can see, but do not overlap each other. If used in conjunction with the Wall Of Darkness talent, your cubes no longer need to be placed contiguously."
    },
    "dual darkness": {
      "benefits": "By spending an additional spell point you can apply two (darkness) or (blot) talents to a single area of darkness (but not one of each). The effect of each talent is resolved separately, and you must pay the spell point costs of each one individually, though other costs (such as metamagic or other talents) are only paid once."
    },
    "extinguish": {
      "benefits": "You may opt to instantly extinguish all non-magical light sources within your areas of darkness, not merely suppress them. This includes fire, incandescence, and alchemical sources. Coals turn cold, glowing-hot metal is made cool, and luminous chemicals are rendered inert. Additionally, your darkness can be used to dispel sources of magical flame (such as an Energy Wall consisting of fire) with a magic skill check. This is an instantaneous effect that occurs when the area of darkness is created. Creatures made of flame or other luminous materials or energies are not harmed by this talent."
    },
    "flowing darkness": {
      "benefits": "Your areas of darkness and blot flow through cracks and crevices like a viscous liquid, allowing them to extend around corners and pass through small cracks and crevices to reach their full radius. Your blot and darkness can flow through porous obstacles such as the gaps around a typical door, a wall rife with rodent holes, or ill-fitting masonry, but not through sealed structures like a ship's hull, a secure safe, or a properly mortared wall."
    },
    "gaze into the abyss": {
      "benefits": "You tap into a well of blackness so deep that it extends beyond the merely visible, threatening to draw in anyone attempting to examine your spellwork with magically enhanced vision. Anyone attempting to divine or determine magical, alignment, or psychic auras of a person or object under the effect of your (blot), (darkness), or (shadow) talents must make an MSB check against your MSD or becomes stunned as if viewing an overwhelming aura. Those who fail this check gain no information and automatically fail any further attempt against any target protected by the same caster's Gaze into the Abyss for 24 hours."
    },
    "greater darkness": {
      "benefits": "When creating an area of darkness or blot, you may spend an additional spell point to increase the affected area. This allows you to create a sphere of darkness with a radius of up to 20 feet + 5 feet per caster level. If combined with the Wall Of Darkness talent, this allows you to create six 10-foot cubes, +2 cubes per caster level."
    },
    "greater darkvision": {
      "benefits": "When granting the Darkvision meld, increase the range of the granted darkvision by 30 feet. You may gain this talent multiple times. Each time this is taken beyond the first, it increases the range of the granted darkvision by an additional 30 feet."
    },
    "greater meld": {
      "benefits": "Your (meld) talents that only work in areas of your darkness instead function in all areas of dim light or darkness."
    },
    "instill dark [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill a meld or shadow effect inside it, which functions as a potion or oil. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "insinuate": {
      "benefits": "You are skilled at slipping your magic into the natural surroundings, subtly manipulating natural murk and shadows to fit your purpose. You may overlap an area of blot with the natural shadows in an area in such a way that it is indistinguishable without magically augmented senses. This ability functions in any lighting condition so long as there are shadows present, and does not change the prevailing lighting condition. This area of blot may be imbued with a Dark sphere talent as normal, though talents with obvious or harmful effects will immediately reveal the ruse. If the lighting in an area is such as to eliminate the casting of any shadows, then insinuate cannot be used. Otherwise, a blot created using this feat covers its normal area of effect."
    },
    "lingering darkness": {
      "benefits": "When you cease concentrating on a darkness or blot effect, you may choose to have the effect remain for two rounds before dissipating."
    },
    "mass meld [mass]": {
      "benefits": "When using a meld, you may spend an additional spell point to affect an additional 1 creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) with the meld at the same time. Each target must be within range and must be affected by the same meld. Once created, each meld is considered a separate sphere effect. When using Mass Meld, the duration of each meld is decreased by one step to 10 minutes per caster level."
    },
    "obfuscation": {
      "benefits": "Creatures and items within your area of darkness or subject to one of your (shadow) talents are treated as if shielded by a veneer of lead, and any attempt to locate them via scrying fails. Divination talents benefiting from a single instance of Penetrating Divination may bypass obfuscation with a successful MSB check. Those benefiting from a second instance of Penetrating Divination bypass Obfuscation automatically. You may take Obfuscation a second time, increase protection to the equivalent of 1 ft. of lead. Scrying attempts using a single instance of Penetrating Divination automatically fail. Attempts using two instances of Penetrating Divination require an MSB check. Obfuscation does not affect the caster's own divinations."
    },
    "quick meld": {
      "benefits": "You may use (meld) talents on yourself and only yourself as a swift action instead of a standard action."
    },
    "ranged darkness [range]": {
      "benefits": "You may create and maintain darkness, blots, or use (shadow) talents on shadows anywhere within long range instead of medium range. You may apply (meld) talents to targets within close range. You may take this talent multiple times, increasing the range by one step each time (close to medium, medium to long)."
    },
    "rolling blackout": {
      "benefits": "You gain the ability to move your areas of darkness or blot. You can move one instance of darkness or blot up to 25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels as a move action, within the maximum range of the effect. If moving an area of darkness or blot causes a creature to leave its area of effect, any ongoing effects the creature is under related to that area of blot or darkness end immediately."
    },
    "shadow coterie": {
      "benefits": "You've learned to manipulate a target's shadow more efficiently, allowing you to apply one additional (shadow) talent to a target for every 5 caster levels, up to 5 at 20th caster level. You may not apply the same (shadow) talent to a single target more than once, save for the Shadow Lurk talent. Using the Shadow Lurk talent or Shadow Double advanced talent no longer removes the target's shadow or renders its Shadow Stash inaccessible unless you wish it to."
    },
    "shadow stash": {
      "benefits": "You may stash items in your shadow, storing each as a move action. The items appear on your shadow as if you were wearing or using them. A small item (a ring or a key) might be unnoticeable, while a larger item (a greatsword, a tower shield) would be quite obvious. Your shadow can store non-wearable items, but it must either hold such items in its hands or in a backpack, if you or your shadow is carrying one. You may store up to 5 lbs. of non-living material per caster level. Items have no weight while stashed and can not be used, activated, or provide passive bonuses. You can retrieve an item worn by your shadow or stored in its backpack as a move action, or an item carried in its hands as a free action, or spend a spell point to retrieve any item as an immediate action. Items stored in your shadow stash cannot be the subject of pickpocket attempts, sunder attempts, or the steal or disarm combat maneuvers unless the creature attempting the maneuver also has the Shadow Stash talent. If your shadow is removed or animated, such as by shadow theft class ability or Shadow Lurk talent, you may not access your shadow stash until your shadow returns. If you die or enter an antimagic area, the contents of your shadow stash immediately appear in the nearest unoccupied space. Investing a second talent in Shadow Stash allows you quicker access to your stashed items, allowing you to withdraw any worn item as a free action. Furthermore, your shadow gains the ability to don items in your place. For example, if you store a cloak of resistance in your shadow you gain the benefit as if you were wearing it. If your shadow dons armor, you gain its bonuses, though also suffer any armor check penalty or movement penalty it would provide. This does not increase your number of magic item slots. If you and your shadow don an item in the same slot, you only gain the benefit of the item your physical body is wearing. You may activate magic items worn by your shadow as normal. This does not allow your shadow to wield weapons or shields, or to activate hand-held magic items. Your shadow can only don items in slots that your physical body possesses. If you are subject to a polymorph effect that would normally remove your armor and equipment, armor donned by your shadow mannequin does not provide any benefits and you may not activate magic items that would otherwise meld with your body."
    },
    "shadow strike [strike] [3pp]": {
      "benefits": "Source:  Expanded Spheres: Baron's Lost Apocrypha As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with using a [shadow] effect. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also affected by the [shadow]. If using a scatter weapon, the [shadow] only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack. If you possess the Clinging Darkness talent, you may affect the target with a [darkness] or [blot] effect in place of a [shadow]"
    },
    "shadowing darkness": {
      "benefits": "When creating an area of darkness you can choose to have your darkness cling to anyone who passes through it and trail from them like smoke. Anyone who leaves the area of your darkness treats areas of bright light as areas of dim light and all other light levels as total darkness for the purposes of determining concealment when it would not be beneficial to them. In addition, they continue to be affected by any (darkness) talents as if they were still in an area of your darkness. These lingering effects last for one round after a creature leaves an area of your darkness. In addition, you may increase the effects of this talent by spending a spell point when you create an area of darkness. If you do so, the effects of this talent linger for an additional round per two caster levels, though a creature can attempt a Reflex save at the end of each of these turns as a move action to remove the clinging shadows."
    },
    "shifting shadows": {
      "benefits": "As a free action at the beginning of your turn or when you first create an area of darkness, you may remove up to one 5-foot square plus an additional 5-foot square per 2 caster levels from anywhere within the area, and may add one 5-foot square plus an additional 5-foot square per 2 caster levels to an existing area of darkness, so long as the addition is contiguous. At the beginning of each turn, you may change which squares are removed or added, but may never add or remove more at one time than your caster level would allow."
    },
    "sinister surprise": {
      "benefits": "When spending a spell point to create an area of darkness or blot that persists without concentration, you may opt to create a darkness or blot effect that remains dormant until triggered by a creature entering the 10 ft. square area at the center of your dormant darkness or blot effect. A sinister surprise can be spotted and disabled as a magical trap, with a DC for both of 25 + 1/2 your caster level. You may also trigger the sinister surprise as an immediate action as long as it is within medium range. You may have multiple sinister surprises active, but their trigger areas may not overlap. An untriggered sinister surprise persists for 1 hour per caster level or until disabled or dismissed. A triggered sinister surprise has the duration of a typical area of darkness or blot. You may take this talent a second time to add extra conditions to the trigger of your Sinister Surprise. You may trigger it yourself from up to long range as an immediate action. Additionally, you may choose any of the following additional conditions: You may allow a number of specific individuals up to your caster level, designated at the time of the casting, to pass through the sinister surprise without setting it off. You may set it to be triggered only by a certain creature type or specific individual with whom you are familiar. You may set your sinister surprise to go off at a specified time within the effect's duration."
    },
    "umbral burst": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create an area of darkness as a swift action. This darkness is temporary, lasting only for one round before the effect ends. You cannot concentrate to maintain it, or spend a spell point to maintain it without concentration. Talents and abilities that would normally extend its duration (such as Lingering Darkness or Eternal Darkness) cannot be applied to areas of darkness created by this talent."
    },
    "wall of darkness": {
      "benefits": "Rather than create a sphere of darkness, you may arrange your darkness as up to three 10-foot cubes, +1 cube per caster level. These cubes must be arranged contiguously, but otherwise may assume any shape. You must be able to perceive all areas your darkness will inhabit. Blot/Darkness/Shadow Talents"
    },
    "black lung (darkness)": {
      "benefits": "Your darkness takes on a foul, miasmic quality that causes creatures to choke and retch. Creatures within must make a Fortitude save or become sickened until they leave the area of Black Lung. Creatures who succeed at this save but remain in the darkness must save again at the end of their turn. If any creature enters this area of darkness, they must save or immediately become sickened. Creatures with the Verbal Casting drawback suffer 50% spell failure while they are sickened by Black Lung. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected by Black Lung. By taking this talent a second time, you may imbue your Black Lung with a dose of contact or inhalation poison held in your hand. Using this ability consumes the dose of poison. Any creature that fails its save against the Black Lung talent must make an additional Fortitude save against the poison's DC or suffer its effects. Those immune to your Black Lung are also immune to the poison. There is no chance of accidentally poisoning yourself when using this ability."
    },
    "creeping lethargy (blot, darkness)": {
      "benefits": "Your darkness fogs the mind, causing those within to slip towards slumber. By spending a spell point you may create a darkness or blot effect that forces creatures within it to make a Will save or become staggered. Creatures that fail this save and remain staggered must make another Will save at the beginning of your next turn or fall asleep for 1 round per caster level or until the darkness expires, whichever happens first. A successful save negates all effects and the target is immune to that instance of Creeping Lethargy. Leaving the area of darkness automatically rouses the creature and removes the staggered condition, but does not render the creature immune should it re-enter the area of effect. This is a mind-affecting effect."
    },
    "directional darkness (darkness)": {
      "benefits": "Your area of darkness only blocks the light from one vantage point. If your darkness is in the form of a wall, it hampers vision from one side and appears clear from the other. If it is spherical, the caster may choose either for those within the area of darkness to see clearly or for those outside to see within clearly. The boundaries of the area of darkness remain obvious to those who can see through it unhindered."
    },
    "disorienting darkness (darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness effect that has a chance to disorient anyone who enters it. When a creature within this area attempts to move, or when a creature first enters this area, they must pass a Will save or become disoriented. A creature must attempt this Will save every time they enter the area of darkness. If the creature fails this saving throw, they must roll a d8 to determine direction: 1 is their intended direction, with 2-8 rotating around the creature in a clockwise direction. The target moves that direction as if it were their intended course. The target does not realize they are off-course until their next turn or until they leave the area of darkness. Augmented:  Investing an additional talent in Disorienting Darkness allows you a modicum of control over your targets' delusions. When a creature that has failed it save against your Disorienting Darkness and become disoriented attempts to move, you may spend an immediate action to choose their direction of travel instead of rolling randomly. Augmented (2):  By spending a third talent on Disorienting Darkness, you gain even more influence over your victims. When a creature that has failed its save and become disoriented by your Disorientating Darkness makes an attack, casts a targeted spell or spell-like ability, or uses a supernatural or extraordinary ability with a specified target, the attack or ability is randomly directed to another legal target within range. If there is no other legal target within range, the attack or ability is not affected. If the affected spell or ability has more than one target, all its targets are randomly chosen from among the legal targets within range. Alternately, you may select the new target or targets as an immediate action instead of determining them randomly. Chosen targets must be legal and you must be able to perceive them."
    },
    "edge of night (darkness) [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness that is unnaturally edgy. Any creature inside the darkness must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d6 slashing damage per 3 caster levels (minimum 1d6). Creatures who remain within this area of darkness must save at the end of your subsequent turns or take additional slashing damage. If a creature enters this area of darkness after it is created, they must immediately save or also suffer this damage. A creature may only be affected by Edge Of Night once per round, regardless of how many times they enter or exit the area that round."
    },
    "fearful darkness (blot, darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness or blot effect that plays with the fears of any who enter it. Creatures within this area of darkness or blot must succeed at a Will save or become shaken. Creatures who succeed at this save but remain in the darkness must save again at the end of your subsequent turns. If any creature enters this area of darkness, they must immediately save or become shaken. When a creature fails their saving throw, they remain shaken for as long as they remain within the area of darkness +1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect."
    },
    "flat black (blot)": {
      "benefits": "Your blot causes its area of effect to appear as a flat, featureless plane of blackness, masking any terrain, traps, or unattended objects within at the time it is cast. Some types of terrain may easily be deduced from context (e.g., a river flowing in one side and out the other). This talent does not hide creatures or hamper attempts at non-visual detection. The DCs for all vision-based perception checks to find something obscured by Flat Black are increased by 10. Darkvision does not pierce Flat Black unless augmented with the Clearsight meld."
    },
    "hungry darkness (blot, darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness or blot effect that saps away the lifeforce of those inside. Any creature inside the darkness or blot must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer 1 point of Constitution damage, +1 per 10 caster levels. Creatures who remain within this area of darkness or blot must save at the end of your subsequent turns or suffer another point of Constitution damage. If a creature enters this area of darkness or blot after it is created, they must immediately save or also suffer this damage. A creature may only be affected by Hungry Darkness once per round, regardless of how many times they enter or exit the area that turn."
    },
    "imbue shadow (shadow)": {
      "benefits": "You may imbue a target's shadow with the power of your darkness magic. As shadow ability, you may spend a spell point to cause a target's shadow to wrap itself around the target, creating a band of supernatural darkness across their eyes, rendering the target blinded. The blindfold lasts as long as you concentrate to a total of 1 round per caster level, but you may spend an additional spell point as a free action to allow the effect to endure for this duration without concentration. Darkvision has no effect on this blindfold, but creatures with the see in darkness ability are immune. Additionally, if a talent is usable as both a (darkness) and (blot), you may now use it as if it also possessed the (shadow) tag. Talents used in this fashion cost an additional spell point to use and have a duration of 1 round per caster level."
    },
    "intoxicating darkness (blot, darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness or blot effect that erodes the mental capacity of those inside. Any creature inside the darkness must pass a Fortitude save or suffer 1 point of Wisdom damage. Creatures who remain within this area of darkness must save at the end of your subsequent turns or suffer another point of Wisdom damage. If a creature enters this area of darkness or blot after it is created, they must immediately save or also suffer this damage.

    "looming darkness (blot, darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness or blot effect that erodes the resolve of those who enter it. Creatures within this area of darkness or blot must succeed at a Will save or suffer a -1 penalty to all saving throws so long as they remain within this area of darkness. This penalty increases by 1 per 5 caster levels. If any creature enters this area of darkness or blot, they must immediately save or suffer this penalty. This is a mind-affecting effect."
    },
    "numbing darkness (blot, darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness or blot effect that subtly anesthetizes those inside. Any creature inside the darkness must pass a Fortitude save or suffer 1 point of Dexterity damage. Creatures who remain within this area of darkness must save at the end of your subsequent turns or suffer another point of Dexterity damage. If a creature enters this area of darkness or blot after it is created, they must immediately save or also suffer this damage. A creature may only be affected by Numbing Darkness once per round, regardless of how many times they enter or exit the area that turn."
    },
    "obscure passage (blot)": {
      "benefits": "By spending a spell point, you modify your blot to serve as a portal through a surface, passing through up to 5 ft. of material per caster level. Obscure Passage can not penetrate a surface with a hardness greater than 5 plus its caster level. Attempting to create an obscure passage through a target that is too thick or too hard causes the spell to fail and all spell points spent to be lost. An Obscure Passage has a maximum diameter of 1 ft. per caster level, and leaves the surface whole and unmarred when it expires. Light does not pass through an obscure passage, nor do low-light vision or darkvision allow a creature to peer through it, though Clearsight and see in darkness do. A creature standing above an obscure passage as it opens may attempt a Reflex save to avoid falling in."
    },
    "pure darkness (darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a darkness effect that negates low-light vision. Darkvision is reduced to 5 feet. In addition, all other senses (blindsight, scent, etc.) are reduced by half. See in darkness is unaffected."
    },
    "shadow lurk (shadow)": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may spend a spell point to have a target's shadow split off from them and form a shadow lurk that acts as an independent creature unwaveringly loyal to you for 10 minutes per caster level. A shadow lurk appears as a shaded, obviously spurious version of the target. It is weightless and its equipment is entirely illusionary. It has the same skills, feats, and attributes as the target, except that its Strength score is 3, and only has a number of hit points equal to your caster level. The shadow lurk cannot attack, use extraordinary or supernatural abilities, cast spells or use spell-like abilities, or employ its target's class features, though it can manipulate objects and use skills. A shadow lurk must remain within long range of its original source or it ceases to exist. The target lacks a shadow while this effect is active. Retracting a shadow lurk is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Either the target or the shadow lurk may spend this action. If a shadow lurk is killed or exceeds its range, it winks out of existence and the target's shadow returns to them with a surge of energy that causes them to be stunned for 1 round. In either case, the target immediately gains the knowledge of everything their shadow lurk observed and did while it was detached. By investing a second talent in Shadow Lurk you master the art of weaving shadowstuff into your shadow lurks, giving them and their equipment increased substance. Your shadow lurks use the full Strength score of their source, have 2 hit points per caster level, and possess non-magical versions of their sources' equipment. It may flank, threaten, and make a single attack per turn using non-magical versions of whatever weapons or natural attacks its source possesses. It attacks using its source's full base attack bonus, Strength score, feats, and proficiencies, but deals only half damage. A shadowstuff-imbued lurk may not attempt combat maneuvers, cast spells, or use its source's class features. Alchemical Items created as part of your lurks do not function. Normal:  A shadow lurk has a strength score of 3 and may not make attacks, flank, or threaten. Its equipment is entirely illusory."
    },
    "shadow slick (blot, shadow)": {
      "benefits": "Your blot takes on a slick, nearly frictionless quality. Any creature attempting to move more than half their speed through the blot must make a Reflex save to avoid falling prone. If used as a (shadow) talent, the target must also make a Reflex save to avoid dropping what is in its hands, and must spend a full-round action to retrieve stored or dropped items as they fumble with compromised grip, but gains a +10 bonus to CMD to avoid a grapple and on Escape Artist checks and CMB rolls made to escape a grapple."
    },
    "shadow tag (blot, darkness, shadow)": {
      "benefits": "Anyone passing through your area of darkness or blot picks up a bit of your magic in their shadow, allowing you to know their relative direction and status (alive, unconscious, dead) for 1 hour per caster level. If used as a (shadow) talent, you cast this ability directly upon a creature instead, gaining the same benefits. You may track up to 1 creature per caster level in this way. If you are at this limit, you must cease tracking an old target in order to begin tracking a new one that passes through your darkness or blot. The effect immediately ends for a target that moves more than one mile away from you. Old Dark Feats Click the header above to visit the Sphere-Focused Feats page.

    "shadowed mien (shadow)": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you cloak the target in an aura of menacing shadow that conceals its appearance, subtle movements, and intentions behind a curtain of disconcerting murk. This dark aura hides distinguishing features from observers and grants a competence bonus of 1/2 your caster level to Bluff checks to lie or feint, as well as to Intimidation checks to demoralize. Sense Motive checks to get a hunch about Shadowed Mien's target have their DC increased by your caster level. The target has no problem seeing out of Shadowed Mein, but the effect cannot be penetrated by darkvision. Clearsight and see in darkness allow the target of Shadowed Mein to be seen clearly. Shadowed Mein lasts for as long as you concentrate or, if you spend one spell point at any time as a free action, ten minutes per caster level. You may spend an additional spell point as part of the action to initiate Shadowed Mein to grant substance to the shadowy aura. The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level for the duration of the effect. Exhausting these temporary hit points does not end the other effects of Shadowed Mein."
    },
    "silent darkness (darkness)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create an area of darkness that dims sound as well as light. Creatures within the area cannot speak or converse, and spells or magical sphere effects with verbal components suffer a 20% chance + 5% per caster level of spell failure.

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create a blot effect filled with dark tendrils that reach out and snare anything that passes. The entire area is considered difficult terrain, and every creature within the area is the target of a grapple check when the blot is created and each round it is maintained. Creatures who enter this area are also immediately subject to a grapple check. The CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier. If successful, the target gains the grappled condition, suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6), and cannot move without first breaking free of the grapple (the CMD of this effect is equal to its CMB + 10). Just as with a normal grappler, this effect gains a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made against targets it is already grappling."

Creatures with extreme vulnerability to daylight, such as vampires and shadow demons, are protected from daylight by this talent. Author's Note:  This talent may be used on creatures which do not cast a shadow (such as vampires or other creatures with the shadowless ability) that otherwise could not be targeted by (shadow) talents.

You may spend 3 spell points as a standard action to split off your shadow to act as an independent creature unwaveringly loyal to you for one hour per caster level. Your shadow double has the same attributes and statistics as you do, but half as many hit points, and its copies of your equipment are entirely non-magical. If it removes or drops its copied equipment, it disappears after 1 round. You may give your shadow double additional equipment to use, including magical equipment, but you share one set of magic item slots and may not both benefit from an item in the same slot. It casts spells and uses spell-like abilities as you do, but you both draw from the same pool of spell points, spell-like abilities, spell slots, and memorized spells. Your shadow double may move any distance from you as long as it remains on the same plane of existence. You do not cast a shadow while this ability is active, nor may you use or be the target of any abilities or talents that affect your shadow while your shadow double is active. Reattaching your shadow double is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Either you or your shadow double may spend this action. If your shadow double is killed or removed from the same plane of existence as you, it winks out of existence and drops any non-copied equipment or items it is carrying, and your shadow returns with a surge of energy that causes you to be stunned for 1d4 rounds. In either case, you immediately gain the knowledge of everything your shadow double observed and did while it was detached."

    "shadow walker (meld)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Dark sphere (Step Through Darkness (meld)), caster level 10th. A target must be within an area of dim light or darkness for you to apply this meld to them. When this talent is applied, the target temporarily steps out of the Material Plane and into the place where it borders the Plane of Shadow. While within this region of shadow, the target may move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, seeing their relative place in the Material Plane, although it appears blurry and lacking in details. At any time, the target may step back into the Material Plane, at which point the effects of this (meld) talent immediately end. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, the target cannot make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It is impossible to judge distances accurately, making this ability ill-suited for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when stepping back into the Material Plane, the target is shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from the desired endpoint. If this would place the target within a solid object, they are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place them within a solid object, they are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders the creature fatigued (no save)."

Benefit:  You deepen your shadow by making it a portal into your extradimensional space, combining your magic into one whole; you can no longer use Extradimensional Storage or Shadow Stash separately, instead treating them as a single effect. Your extradimensional shadow combines the weight limit of the two talents into a single progression (15 pounds per caster level, or 30 pounds per caster if you have invested two talents in Extradimensional Storage) and you may store and withdraw items in it using any action options either talent allows. Objects in your extradimensional shadow cannot be affected by creatures with Shadow Stash, and they do not become unavailable if your shadow is stolen: a flickering portal in the shape of your shadow remains, allowing you to access items regardless. If you have invested two talents in Shadow Stash, your shadow may don items even if they are not your size, stretching and warping to fit into them. You must still have the appropriate body slot for the item. You may treat your extradimensional shadow as either talent for all purposes. Among other uses, this allows you to apply the effects of feats like Stasis Storage or World In Miniature to it, which often distort the appearance of your shadow.

Benefit:  Whenever you use the Dark sphere darkness sphere effect, you may instead fill the area with twinkling starlight. This altered darkness effect is referred to as \"starlight darkness\". Instead of altering the area's light level, all creatures in a starlight darkness's area are dazzled. A Dark sphere effect modified by this feat is no longer dispelled by Light sphere effects and continues to function in areas with magical light. If you would create starlight darkness modified with the Dark sphere Pure Darkness (darkness) talent, instead of altering the area's light level, the penalties of the dazzled condition increase by +1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. If you would spend an additional spell point with the Dark sphere Pitch Black advanced talent, instead of altering the area's light level, the dazzled condition imposed by starlight darkness applies to all attack rolls, even if the creature does not rely on sight, can pinpoint their target through other means (such as blindsight), or would otherwise be immune to the dazzled condition. When creating starlight darkness, you may add a (light) talent instead of a (darkness) talent to the area. A (light) talent used with starlight darkness must be one that affects all creatures in the light's radius (such as Disorienting Patterns, Hypnotic Pattern, Searing Light, etc.) and has no additional effects for an individual target (even if attached to that target with Clinging Darkness). Starlight darkness with a (light) talent is treated as a glow effect for the purposes of a (light) talent's effects. Starlight darkness is otherwise a Dark sphere effect, and effects such as the Dark sphere Clearsight (meld) treat this effect as a normal (darkness) effect. You may spend a standard action to treat the starlight darkness as though it were an area of bright light or as part of the standard action used to create the starlight darkness, and functions as if it were bright light for the starlight darkness's duration.

This imposes a -5 penalty on all Diplomacy checks against a creature that can see the shadow (DC 5 Perception check to notice). If the caster lacks a shadow, one is created for the duration of this effect. \n \n \n 10 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster suffers a bout of photophobic vertigo, suffering the sickened condition in areas of normal light and the nauseated condition in areas of bright light. \n \n \n 11 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects of the Light sphere or with the light descriptor originating from hostile creatures within long range of the caster have their caster level increased by 1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels of the triggering effect. \n \n \n 12 \n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the target or center of the target area for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within partial concealment. Any creature within the effect must succeed on a Reflex save each round or be entangled until the start of their next turn. \n \n \n 13 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 14 \n The target or creatures in the target area must succeed on a Will save or gain an additional shadow at 180 degrees from their normal shadows for 10 minutes per caster level. \n \n \n 15 \n Any light source in the possession of the target or creatures in the target area when the effect is cast has its effect on illumination inverted for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 16 \n A shadow twin of the caster appears adjacent to the caster. This twin possesses all of the caster's abilities and equipment, though only 1 hit point. This twin aids the caster for 1 minute per caster level or until slain. The twin and all its equipment disappear when the twin is slain or the effect expires. Any non-instantaneous effect originating from the twin end when it disappears. \n \n \n 17 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster treats areas of normal or brighter light as if they were solid objects and is unable to enter or pass through such an area, though retains line of effect through such areas. \n \n \n 18 \n (Combat) The caster is stunned for 1 round. \n \n \n 19 \n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to blind nearby creatures, performing a dirty trick combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Dirty Trick and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \n \n \n 20 \n The caster takes untyped nonlethal damage equal to caster level. This damage does not force concentration checks to cast or maintain sphere effects or spells. \n \n \n 21 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects of the Light sphere or with the light descriptor cast within long range of the caster have their caster level increased by 1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels of the triggering effect. \n \n \n 22 \n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, the caster absorbs all light, appearing perfectly black and is blind. \n \n \n 23 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster gains a 20% miss chance while in areas of less than normal light. \n \n \n 24 \n The caster is fatigued. \n \n \n 25 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 26 \n The caster takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \n \n \n 27 \n Creatures subject to the effect receive the half of any damage the caster receives for the duration of their time subject to the effect. This damage is redirected from the caster, reducing the amount he is damaged by an equal amount. Resistance and immunity apply to this damage. Multiple affected creatures divide this damage equally. \n \n \n 28 \n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 29 \n The caster becomes afraid of the light, taking a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects while in areas with greater than dim light for 1 hour per caster level. \n \n \n 30 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 31 \n Any light source in the caster's possession has its effect on illumination inverted for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 32 \n The target or any creature in the area of the effect when it is cast must succeed on a Fortitude save or begin to absorb all light, appearing perfectly black and be blinded for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 33 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster gains the light blindness monster ability. Creatures with light blindness are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. Such creatures are dazzled as long as they remain in areas of bright light. \n \n \n 34 \n For 1 hour per caster level, all shadows within long range of the caster all lengthened as if exposed to a sunset. \n \n \n 35 \n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of his choice from this sphere for 1 round. \n \n \n 36 \n The caster becomes blind in any area with greater than dim light for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 37 \n The caster's shadow attempts to pilfer items from nearby creatures, performing a steal combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level and storing any items successfully stolen in the caster's gear. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Steal and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \n \n \n 38 \n The caster's shadow takes on a sinister appearance for 10 minutes per caster level, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks but imposing a -2 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. \n \n \n 39 \n Affected creatures or those within the effect's area receive the caster's casting drawbacks for the duration of their time in the effect or for as long as they are affected by it. \n \n \n 40 \n The ambient light level with the caster's Dark sphere range is reduced by one step unless this reduction would make it darker than dim light. The effect remains centered on the caster for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 41 \n Any creature within long range of the caster that is in an area of dim or lower illumination takes 1 point of negative energy damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 42 \n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, all creatures other than the caster can see normally in regular and magical darkness within medium range of the caster. \n \n \n 43 \n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are lost. \n \n \n 44 \n (Combat) for 1 round per caster level, the caster becomes an area of darkness. The caster generates an area of darkness in his space as if he had cast darkness. The caster may move with his normal movement speeds, but may not otherwise take any actions other than to change his choice or (darkness) talents active in this area and to concentrate on any ongoing effects. The caster may not be targeted or effected by anything other than effects that would dispel the darkness. Any effect that dispels this darkness causes the caster to reform and take 1d6 points of untyped damage per 2 caster levels of the dispelling effect. \n \n \n 45 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all effects with the dark descriptor cast within long range of the caster have their caster level increased by 1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels of the triggering effect. \n \n \n 46 \n Darkness sweeps outward from the caster, reducing light levels by 2 steps in a long range emanation for 1 round. Make a single magical skill check and compare it with the MSD of all Light sphere effects in range; success means the Light sphere effect is dispelled as with the Counterspell feat. \n \n \n 47 \n The caster is exhausted. \n \n \n 48 \n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 49 \n The target or creatures in the target area when the effect is cast must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the see in darkness monster ability for 1 round per caster level but is blind in anything brighter than dim light. \n \n \n 50 \n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to pilfer items from nearby allied creatures, performing a steal combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level and storing any items successfully stolen in the caster's gear. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Steal and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \n \n \n 51 \n For 1d6 rounds, the caster leaves an area of darkness in all squares he has occupied since the start of his last turn. A (darkness) talent may be applied to this effect as normal. \n \n \n 52 \n All creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the light blindness monster ability for 1 minute per caster level. Creatures with light blindness are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. Such creatures are dazzled as long as they remain in areas of bright light. \n \n \n 53 \n The caster gains an additional shadow at 180 degrees from his normal shadow for 10 minutes per caster level. \n \n \n 54 \n The caster's active Dark sphere effects flicker randomly, having only a 50% chance of functioning each round (rolled immediately and again at the beginning of the caster's turn) for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 55 \n The target or creatures in the target area must succeed on a Will save or become blind in any area greater than dim light for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 56 \n The caster gains the see in darkness monster ability for 1 minute per caster level. The caster can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by the deeper darkness spell or the Pure Darkness talent. \n \n \n 57 \n Any creature within close range of the target or center of the target area that is in an area of normal or brighter light takes 1 point of untyped damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 58 \n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the caster for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within partial concealment. Any creature within the effect must succeed on a Reflex save each round or be entangled until the start of their next turn. \n \n \n 59 \n For 1 hour per caster level, the caster absorbs all light, appearing perfectly black. \n \n \n 60 \n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \n \n \n 61 \n (Combat) Black tendrils of semi-solid darkness cover an area out to close range of the caster for 1d6 rounds, creating difficult terrain and granting all creatures within that area partial concealment. \n \n \n 62 \n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 63 \n The caster's shadow gains a color of the GM's choice for 10 minutes per caster level. This tint extends to all Dark sphere abilities originating from the caster during this time but has no other effect. \n \n \n 64 \n The target or creatures in the target area must succeed on a Will save or become blind in any area with less than normal light for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 65 \n (Combat) The caster's shadow attempts to trip nearby allied creatures, performing a trip combat maneuver on an adjacent creature each round for 1 minute per caster level. This maneuver uses the caster's CMB (or caster level + casting ability modifier, if higher) and bonuses and provokes attacks of opportunity against the caster as normal for the maneuver, though benefits from Improved Trip and similar feats if the caster possesses them. If the caster lacks a shadow, a shadow is created for the duration of this effect. \n \n \n 66 \n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \n \n \n 67 \n A shadow twin of the caster appears adjacent to the caster. This twin possesses all of the caster's abilities and equipment, though only 1/2 his hit points and attempts to harm the caster and the caster's allies to the best of its abilities for 1 minutes per caster level or until slain. The twin and all its equipment disappears when the twin is slain or the effect expires. Any non-instantaneous effect originating from the twin end when it disappears. \n \n \n 68 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 69 \n Any creature within long range of the caster that is in an area of normal or brighter light takes 1 point of untyped damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 70 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 71 \n The caster casts no shadow for 10 minutes per caster level. \n \n \n 72 \n Any creature within long range of the target or center of the target area that is in an area of dim or lower illumination takes 1 point of negative energy damage per caster level each round for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 73 \n The ambient light level with the caster's Dark sphere range is reduced by one step unless this reduction would make it darker than dim light.

    "blot": {
      "benefits": "Masters of the Dark sphere aren't limited to creating globes of murk. Instead, they can spread pools of darkness to deliver their magic. A blot is a darkness effect created on a two-dimensional surface, such as the ground or a wall, appearing as an inky coating rather than a volume of decreased illumination. Blots do not affect the light level of the area. The Clearsight meld functions on blots the same as it does on areas of darkness. Dark talents listed with the (blot) tag can be applied to an area of darkness to add additional effects and to cause it to manifest as a blot. Only one such talent may be applied to an individual blot, but blots and darkness with different effects may overlap. Individual blots do not stack with themselves, nor do they stack with similar (darkness) talents. If a talent is labeled as (blot) and (darkness), the caster may decide whether to manifest an area of blot or darkness when the sphere effect is created. This decision cannot be changed. In order for a blot to affect a target, it must be in contact with the blot. Blots count as areas of darkness with respect to melds and interactions with Light sphere effects and talents."

Unless otherwise indicated, a shadow may be applied to a target within medium range as a standard action. Only one shadow may be applied to any one target at a time. An unwilling target is allowed a Will save to negate a shadow. The duration of each shadow is specified in its description. If a shadow can be maintained through concentration, you must remain within medium range of the target to do so. Shadows function normally within areas of glow, neither suppressing nor being suppressed by areas of glow simply by entering them. If a Light sphere effect and shadow are cast directly upon the same target, however, the caster of the Light sphere effect must pass a magic skill check against the MSD of the shadow's caster. If the check succeeds, the the Light sphere effect functions normally and the shadow is suppressed. If it fails, the shadow functions normally and the Light sphere effect is suppressed. Time spent suppressed counts against the duration of the effect in either case. Dark Talents"

These lingering effects last for one round after a creatures leaves an area of your darkness. In addition, you may increase the effects of this talent by spending a spell point when you create an area of darkness.

Creatures who succeed at this save but remain in the darkness must save again at the end of your subsequent turns. If any creature enters this area of darkness, they must immediately save or suffer the effects.

This does not grant the target the ability to see in your darkness if it does not already possess the means to do so, but it does allow creatures with Darkvision to see in Pure Darkness. Augmented:  By investing a second talent, you may choose to have your Clearsight apply to (darkness) and (blot) talents cast by allies. If you or your ally gains the benefit of Clearsight from another source, you may choose to allow it to it apply to your own darkness and blot effects as well. Status as an ally is determined at the time Clearsight is cast and does not change for its duration. Normal:  Clearsight only grants immunity from effects created by the caster herself."

    "dark slaughter (meld) [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to grant the target the ability to make precision strikes for 1 hour per caster level. Whenever the target attacks a creature it is flanking, that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, or that is not able to perceive the creature (such as through a successful Stealth check), it deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage to the target. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit, but it does stack with a rogue's sneak attack. This only functions while within an area of your darkness."

As a move action, the target may teleport up to 30 ft. This lasts for 1 hour per caster level. Both the location they are in and the location they are teleporting to must be within an area of your darkness. Augmented:  By investing a second talent you increase the maximum teleportation distance of your Step Through Darkness meld talent by +10 ft. per 3 caster levels, minimum +10 ft.

Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate this effect. This volume of liquid is a extradimensional space 5 ft. deep per caster level, and does not damage the surface the blot has been cast upon. If the target possesses the ability to breathe underwater, it can breathe within the blot. Light does not pass through the blot liquid, and those within have their senses limited as if by the Pure Darkness talent. Creatures are deposited safely on the surface of the blot directly above their position when the duration expires. Stygian Immersion does not function on a blot imbued with the Obscure Passage talent. Shadow Talents"

    "blindfold (shadow)": {
      "benefits": "By spending a spell point, you concentrate a target's shadow into a band of supernatural darkness across their eyes, rendering the target blinded. The blindfold lasts as long as you concentrate or, if you spend an additional spell point as a free action, 1 round per caster level. A creature under the effects of a blindfold receives a new Will save to end the effect every round at the end of its turn. Darkvision has no effect on Blindfold, but creatures with the see in darkness ability are immune."

    "shadow stash (shadow)": {
      "benefits": "You may stash items in your shadow, storing each as a move action. The items appear on your shadow as if you were wearing or using them. A small item (a ring or a key) might be unnoticeable, while a larger item (a greatsword, a tower shield) would be quite obvious. You may store up to 5 lbs. of non-living material per caster level. Items have no weight while stashed and can not be used, activated, or provide passive bonuses. You can retrieve an item as a move action at no cost, or spend a spell point to retrieve an item as an immediate action. Items stored in your shadow stash cannot be the subject of pickpocket attempts, Sunder attempts, or the Steal combat maneuver unless the creature attempting the maneuver also has the Shadow Stash talent. If your shadow is removed or animated, such as by shadow theft class ability or Shadow Lurk talent, you may not access your shadow stash until your shadow returns. If you die or enter an antimagic area, the contents of your shadow stash immediately appear in the nearest unoccupied space. Shadow Stash may be used in conjunction with other (shadow) talents. Investing a second talent in Shadow Stash allows you quicker access to your stashed items, allowing you to withdraw them as free action. Furthermore, your shadow gains the ability to don items in your place. For instance, you may store a cloak of resistance in your shadow, and you yourself gain the benefit as if you were wearing it. This does not increase your number of magic item slots. If you and your shadow don an item in the same slot, you only gain the benefit of the item your physical body is wearing. You may activate magic items worn by your shadow as normal. This does not allow your shadow to wield weapons or shields, or to activate hand-held magic items. Items worn by your shadow can only be sundered, stolen, or disarmed by creatures with the ability to access your shadow stash. Items worn by your shadow count against the weight limit of Shadow Stash. Your shadow does not have actions of its own, and uses your actions to don and activate items. You may withdraw un-donned items from your shadow stash as a free action at no spell point cost. Your shadow can only don items in slots that your physical body possesses. If you are subject to a polymorph effect, armored donned by your shadow mannequin does not provide any benefits and you may not activate magic items that would otherwise meld with your body."

      "benefits": "The subject of your ghost strike becomes fatigued for 1 round per caster level (Fortitude negates). You may spend a spell point to increases this effect to making the target exhausted for 1 minute per caster level (Fortitude partial). On a successful save, the target is still fatigued for 1 round. Unlike regular fatigue and exhaustion, these conditions end as soon as the duration expires. Reanimate As a standard action, you may touch an intact dead body and spend a spell point to reanimate it as a zombie or skeleton (depending on the composition of the body in question) for 1 minute per caster level. This creature gains the zombie or skeleton template and obeys your commands, although only basic commands such as \"go\", \"stay\", \"follow me\", \"attack\", or \"guard\" are understandable. While specifics can be given (\"guard this area against humans but let goblins pass\"), undead are unintelligent and easily fooled. A reanimated body cannot speak and has no knowledge or ability to think and so cannot answer questions or reveal anything it knew in life. When the duration expires, the body collapses until reanimated again. It does not regain hit points between reanimations. If reduced to 0 hit points, the body collapses and is destroyed; it cannot be reanimated again. You may have a total number of reanimated creatures active at any one time whose combined Hit Dice does not exceed twice your caster level. If you attempt to reanimate a creature that would push your total beyond this limit, you must choose which creatures cease to be reanimated or are released from your control. You cannot reanimate a creature with more Hit Dice than twice your caster level. Temporary increases to caster level (such as from implements or the thaumaturge's forbidden lore class feature) do not increase the statistics, maximums, or number of undead the caster controls. Animate Dead: \nUndead created through the Death sphere count against the total number of undead that can be controlled by the  animate dead  spell, if using both spells and spheres in the same game.

The corpse explodes in a 20-ft. radius, affecting all creatures in range as if they had been struck by the chosen ghost strike; if the ghost strike does not allow a saving throw, creatures affected are allowed a Reflex save to negate its effects. The corpse or undead collapses and is destroyed; it cannot be reanimated or targeted by another Corpse Bomb."

    "corpse manipulation": {
      "benefits": "You can alter a corpse in one of the following ways by touching it as a standard action: You grow flesh on a decomposed or skeletonized corpse, providing it with sufficient flesh that it can be animated as a zombie rather than a skeleton. The corpse looks as it did just before death. The new flesh is not fit for eating. \n You decompose the flesh from a corpse, leaving behind a perfectly cleaned skeleton. \n You can spend a spell point to touch a collapsed or destroyed undead corpse, mending it so it is a valid target to be reanimated again. \n You can spend a spell point to preserve the remains of a dead creature for 1 day per caster level so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead. Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant. This ability also works on severed body parts and the like. \n You can reshape the dead body look like another creature or even a specific person so long as you have firsthand knowledge of how that creature or person actually looks. You can make the corpse one size larger or smaller or change its apparent type, gender, or age. Creatures interacting with the corpse may make a Will save to detect the deception. If you chose to make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone who knows that individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not actually that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or less they believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled the person they knew rather than a deliberate fake."

    "cryptic strike [strike]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with making a ghost strike. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also struck by the ghost strike. If using a scatter weapon, the strike only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack."

      "benefits": "When you reanimate a creature you may reanimate it as a variant skeleton or zombie, such as a bloody skeleton, burning skeleton, fast zombie, or plague zombie. When reanimating a creature in this way, they count as twice their normal Hit Dice when casting the reanimate sphere effect, but once controlled, count normally against your Hit Dice limit. Example:  For a Death sphere caster level of 10 who gained this talent, the caster can reanimate and control a combined total of 20 Hit Dice of creatures. The largest creature the caster can reanimate is either a 20 Hit Dice skeleton or zombie or a 10 Hit Dice variant skeleton or zombie. A variant skeleton or zombie does not count as 20 Hit Dice for your Hit Dice limit, only for the initial casting of the reanimate sphere effect. Hit Dice multipliers are additive; an undead with two variants, such as a bloody burning skeleton, counts for three times its normal Hit Dice (x2 increasing to x3) for the purposes of reanimating."

You can communicate with, ask questions of, and receive answers from them. A mindless undead or corpse spoken to with gravetongue does not maintain any memory of its life or death - only the time that has elapsed since its death (and reanimation). A normal corpse's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make undead creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal, and while mindless undead and corpses will always answer truthfully, their ability to answer more than simple questions is restricted.

Any creature who steps onto that square is affected by your ghost strike. If the ghost strike does not allow a saving throw, the creature affected is allowed a Will save to negate its effects. A haunting apparition lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before becoming inert. It shares your alignment, and its Perception DC and hp are equal to its save DC. You may only have one active haunt apparition at a time; placing a second haunting apparition deactivates the first. You may select this talent multiple times. Each time it is taken, increase the number of haunting apparitions you may have active at once by 1."
    },
    "icy grip": {
      "benefits": "When you use a ghost strike, instead of unleashing an attack yourself, you may have an undead you control within range deliver the attack as a melee touch attack sometime within the next round. This charge is 'held' through the round; if the undead gets multiple attacks, it can attempt to deliver the touch attack additional times if the first attempt failed. If you spend an additional spell point, you may grant a use of this ghost strike to each undead you control, but multiple undead cannot affect the same target with the same ghost strike that round."

    "instill death [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill a reanimate inside it, which functions as an oil. This cannot be combined with Sustained Reanimation, and undead created through an instilled liquid still consider you their creator, counting against your totals and following your commands. Alternatively, you may spend a spell point to instill a ghost strike. As a standard action, this can be primed and thrown as a splash weapon. All targets affected by the splash (5-foot radius) must save against any ghost strike effect requiring a saving throw, but any target not affected by a direct hit treats any dice rolls from the effect as if they had rolled their minimum. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."

You may reanimate a single corpse as a sustained undead without spending a spell point, but the duration of the reanimate effect is changed to 'concentration'. A sustained undead only counts as half their Hit Dice (rounded up, minimum 1) against the total amount you may have reanimated at once. You can never have more than 1 sustained undead.

If you spend an additional spell point, it cannot heal hit point damage by any means for the duration, including fast healing and regeneration. In addition, you can touch a willing creature as a standard action to cause them to be healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy for 1 minute (Fortitude negates if unwilling); as normal, fast healing is unaffected."

    "tomb of flesh": {
      "benefits": "You can make a melee touch attack against a living creature up to your size to attempt to absorb it into your body, similar to the swallow whole ability (Reflex negates). Being absorbed causes a creature to take negative energy damage each round equal to 1d6 + 1d6 for every three caster levels you have (undead are not affected). An absorbed creature gains the grappled condition, while you do not. An absorbed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 your total hit points), or it can just try to escape as if escaping a grapple (using your CMD or your MSD, whichever is higher). The armor class of your interior is 10 + 1/2 your caster level, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If an absorbed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use this talent again until the damage is healed. Alternatively, you can touch a corpse or undead that you control as a move action to absorb it into your body or to expel an absorbed corpse or undead into an adjacent square. While absorbed, an undead cannot use any of its senses or take any actions, and time passes normally - corpses rot and reanimate's duration continues to pass. You can have a number of corpses or controlled undead absorbed at a time equal to 1 plus 1 for every 3 caster levels you have. You can spend a spell point to expel all absorbed corpses and undead with a single swift action. While you have at least one undead absorbed, you give off an aura that can be detected by divine undead equal to the highest Hit Dice undead absorbed, but your appearance is not otherwise changed. Creatures and bodies storied within your Tomb of Flesh are stored in an extra-dimensional space; you do not increase in size no matter how many creatures and bodies are stored inside you."

Only targets completely under your control are valid; charmed undead are not truly under your control, and as such do not qualify. Giving basic commands to an undead is a free action, but your increased control allows you to master complex commands for your undead as well. Choose any 2 tricks + 1 per 5 caster levels that can be taught to an animal or the pose as scenery trick (see the Handle Animal skill). Mindless undead you control are able to perform these tricks when ordered to as a move action. This does not allow you to train undead for a purpose, \"push\" an undead to perform a task it normally would not be able to, or accomplish other effects of the Handle Animal skill. Additionally, so long as an undead you control is within your dominion range, you may, as a full-round action, concentrate on that undead to perceive that creature's surroundings as if you were standing where that creature was. While you may use the creature's special sense (i.e., darkvision, etc.), you must use your own Perception skill if attempting a check. You can select this talent multiple times; each time you do after the first, increase the number of tricks your undead can perform by 3."

    "necrotic conduit (dominion) [gravecaller's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You gain the following abilities which allow you to direct, manipulate, and command undead creatures you control within your dominion range: Command Attack:  As a standard action, one undead within your dominion range makes an attack against a creature within its threatened reach (or range, if the undead can use a ranged weapon). If you possess the Mass Death Magic talent, you may spend an additional spell point to grant an attack to 1 additional undead per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). If a creature would be attacked by more than one undead with this effect, choose one undead to be the primary attacker. Each additional undead attacking that same target instead uses the aid another action to assist the primary attacking undead's attack roll, even if those undead could not normally use the aid another action to assist against that target. If you possess the Reanimated Warriors talent, you may use this ability to allow your undead to assist your own efforts. As an immediate action after you make a weapon attack roll, you may choose one undead within your dominion range. That undead either uses the aid another action to assist your attack roll or is granted an attack of opportunity against the target of your attack, provided that your attack hits the target. An undead granted the ability to use the aid another action or granted an attack of opportunity this way must be able to take the action normally, such as being in a position to aid another you normally or by having the target of your attack within their threatened area. \n Siphon Life:  Whenever you or an undead within your dominion range reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, you may use this talent as an immediate action to grant yourself or an undead within range a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level which last for 1 minute. You may use this effect as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your turn by spending an additional spell point. \n Creatures within your dominion range of you or an undead with temporary hit points from this effect take a -2 penalty on their saving throw against the Necrotic Feeding (ghost strike) talent. \n Unnerving Pulse:  As a standard action, one undead within range releases an unnerving wave of energy. Creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels are shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Mindless undead under your control are always considered willing targets of these abilities. An unwilling undead may attempt a Will save to negate this talent's effects and not be manipulated."

    "piecemeal reanimation (dominion) [gravecaller's hb]": {

When reanimating piecemeal undead this way, use the statistics of an appropriately sized animated object  with the undead construction flaw and no other construction point abilities or construction flaws. Piecemeal undead otherwise count as an undead creature you reanimated, count against the total number of reanimated creatures you may have active at any one time normally, and obey your commands as normal for an undead you reanimated. A piecemeal undead will usually be anywhere from three sizes smaller to approximately the same size as the original corpse. See Table: Piecemeal Undead to determine the appropriate animated object size for a piecemeal undead. A piecemeal undead is not a skeleton or zombie and cannot be modified by the Expanded Necromancy talent, except as described below. Piecemeal undead do not count as animated objects for the purposes of Enhancement sphere talents, feats, and other abilities. Infuse Piecemeal Undead:  You can grant an intact undead under your control the ability to split off parts of itself to create piecemeal undead as described in the Reanimate Piecemeal Undead ability. As a standard action, or as a free action when reanimating one or more undead, you may spend a spell point to grant one undead within your dominion range the ability to split off a part of itself. If you possess Mass Death Magic, you may spend an additional spell point to grant this ability to 1 additional undead per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). An undead granted the ability to split off a part of itself can spend a full-round action to create a piecemeal undead of an appropriate size to the body part used into an adjacent, unoccupied space (such as a zombie tearing off its own arm or hand, or the skull of a skeleton popping off). You must be able to control the Hit Dice of a piecemeal undead created this way or it fails to be created. Piecemeal undead created this way share the duration of the reanimate effect which initially created the intact undead it was separated from and possesses any properties (including defensive abilities, special abilities, and special attacks) possessed by that undead, subject to GM discretion, but does not increase any existing defensive abilities it would possess as a piecemeal undead (such as damage reduction or natural armor). This can include abilities granted by a variant, such as those from the Expanded Necromancy talent, allowing for a bloody skeleton to separate its arm from itself to create an appropriately sized \"bloody\" piecemeal undead with the fast healing and deathless qualities from the bloody skeleton variant. Only undead raised from intact corpses, such as those normally available without this talent, can be granted the ability to split with this talent; piecemeal undead can never be granted the ability to split off parts of themselves. An intact undead can only separate a single part of itself as a piecemeal undead at any given time, but can spend a move action when within reach of the piecemeal undead created from its body to rejoin with it. When an undead separates a part of itself to create a piecemeal undead, it loses a number of hit points equal to the piecemeal undead's hit points, to a maximum of half the intact undead's current hit points. If the body part used grants the intact undead a natural attack (such as a skeleton removing its arm), that undead loses that natural attack until it rejoins with the piecemeal undead. If the body part is one of the intact undead's legs or wings, it reduces its movement speed with the appropriate movement type by 10 feet until it rejoins with the piecemeal undead. Table: Piecemeal Undead Piecemeal Undead Size \n Body Part Example \n \n \n Three sizes smaller than corpse \n Finger, toe, other minor body \n \n \n Two sizes smaller than corpse \n Foot, hand, organ \n \n \n One size smaller than corpse \n Arm, leg, skull \n \n \n Same size as corpse \n Torso plus limb(s)"

These skill ranks cannot be spent on a Knowledge skill, but otherwise any skill is valid as long as either you or the creature (when it was alive) possess ranks in the chosen skill. Undead cannot possess more ranks in a skill than either you possess in that skill or that it possessed in life, whichever is greater.

    "bleeding wounds (ghost strike)": {
      "benefits": "You may make a ghost strike that deals 1 bleed damage per caster level (minimum 1; no save). Targets take damage on the round they are hit, plus each additional round until the bleed effect stops (usually through the Heal skill or an application of magical healing). You may spend a spell point to improve this effect to 2 bleed damage per caster level (minimum 2)."

    "bonerattle (ghost strike) [gravecaller's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may make a ghost strike that painfully contorts the target's skeleton, exoskeleton, or body. The target suffers 1d6 + 1d6 per 3 caster levels damage and moves 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels into an unoccupied space of your choice (Fortitude partial; half damage and no forced movement). Forced movement from this effect does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target can only move into a space it could reach with its natural movement. The target receives a +4 bonus to their saving throw if you would move them into a location that is directly harmful to them (such as onto a bed of spikes, out of a window, etc.). If you spend an additional spell point when using this ghost strike, the target is repeatedly wracked with pain for a short time. On a failed Fortitude saving throw against this ghost strike's initial effects, the target is afflicted for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). For the duration of this effect, the target suffers the effects of this ghost strike at the start of its turn, taking damage and being forced to move. The target is granted a new saving throw against this ghost strike to reduce its effects, but a successful saving throw does not end this ghost strike's duration. Special:  This ghost strike affects any creature with a skeleton, exoskeleton, or other similar body structure, bypassing any racial immunity to Fortitude saves or death effects the target may possess. Creatures without discernible anatomy are immune (such as elementals, oozes, or other appropriate creatures, usually those immune to critical hits or with the amorphous universal monster rule). At the GM's discretion, creatures with reasonably discernable anatomy or body structures, such as a robot or construct whose inner gears and pieces may instead shake and rattle violently, can be affected by this ghost strike. Author's Note:  For the purposes of the Killing Curse talent, only the initial saving throw is considered the saving throw \"against your ghost strike\"; additional, subsequent saving throws during Bonerattle's duration do not count towards Killing Curse."

    "command undead (ghost strike)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that grants you a measure of control over an undead creature (Will negates). For 1 minute per caster level, an unintelligent undead creature falls under your control or an intelligent undead becomes friendly toward you. You can give an intelligent undead creature orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it would not ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks this effect. Your commands are not telepathic; the undead creature must be able to hear you. Intelligent undead remember they were manipulated and may seek revenge."

    "curse (ghost strike) [curse]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend 2 spell points to make a ghost strike that bestows a permanent curse on the target (Will negates). Curses may be removed with the Break Enchantment Life talent, rituals such as break enchantment or remove curse, wishes, upon your death, or by your choice as a free action, but otherwise cannot be dispelled. Choose one of the following curses to bestow upon the target: The target suffers a -4 decrease to an ability score plus an additional -2 per 5 caster levels (minimum 1). \n The target suffers a -3 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks plus an additional -1 per 5 caster levels. \n Each turn the target has a 25% chance to take no action. This chance increases by 5% per 2 caster levels (maximum 75%). Curses do not stack with themselves, but a target can be afflicted by multiple different curses. With GM permission, you may invent your own curse, but it should be of equal power to those listed. The following effects would be considered appropriate: Black Mark:  The target is trailed by an unpleasant aura. The target takes a penalty on all Diplomacy and Handle Animal checks equal to 1/2 your caster level. All creatures begin with an attitude of unfriendly towards you (unless their attitude would start worse). Any animals the target interacts with react wildly, with prey animals running away and predator animals baring fangs or even attacking the target. [Gravecaller's HB] \n Clumsy:  The target cannot move faster than half their speed without an Acrobatics check vs. the curse's DC. On a failure, the target falls prone. \n Extreme Hunger:  The target must eat and drink three times as much as normal every day or begin suffering from thirst and starvation. \n Fumble:  Anytime the victim picks up or retrieves an object (including drawing a weapon or ammunition), there is a 50% chance that he immediately drops it. If ammunition is dropped, the attack being made is lost. Any remaining attacks in a full attack action may still be attempted. \n Greater Pain:  Whenever the victim takes damage, he is staggered for 1 round. \n Magically Conductive:  When the victim is adjacent to the area of a damaging spell or spell-like effect, the area expands to include the victim. \n Old Age:  The target gains the penalties (but not the benefits) of advancing to the next age category. This does not actually increase their age. \n Phobia:  The target is cursed with a fear of a concept, chosen by the caster (such as crowds, spiders, rats, thunder, loud noises, etc.). Each round the target sees or hears a manifestation of its phobia (such as a spider, or an illusionary spider), the target must succeed at a Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds. A target cannot be frightened by the same phobia's manifestation more than once per hour (such as the same spider, the same crowd, etc.) but new instances of the phobia work normally. GMs should determine if a phobia is appropriate by considering how frequently the target may encounter it. A phobia which would constantly trigger, such as a phobia towards \"skin\" or \"all clothing\", would be more debilitating than the chance to take no action from the Curse (ghost strike)'s base options, and would not be appropriate. This curse is a mind-affecting effect. [Gravecaller's HB] \n Repel Healing:  The victim cannot heal naturally, and magical healing heals the victim by only half the usual amount (minimum 1 point). Fast healing and regeneration are likewise halved. \n Unfocused:  The target suffers a penalty equal to your casting ability modifier to all skill checks governed by an attribute of your choice."

    "drain (ghost strike)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that imposes 1 temporary negative level on the target for one hour per caster level (no save). This increases by 1 die size per 5 caster levels (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, and 1d6). Unlike with other ghost strikes, negative levels stack. While normally negative levels have a chance to become permanent and can kill a target whose negative levels equal its Hit Dice, these negative levels do not last long enough to become permanent, and if a negative level from this ghost strike would reduce the creature to 0 Hit Dice, the creature instead takes 4 points of Constitution drain for the duration of the effect. If a negative level lasts longer than 1 day, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save per negative level or have the negative level become permanent. If this ability is used on an undead creature, it instead grants the creature 5 temporary hit points per negative level, which last for 1 hour."

    "fowl infestation (ghost strike) [curse] [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that permanently curses the target to become plagued by chickens, ducks, or another similar bird of your choice (Will negates). Whenever the target draws a weapon or pulls an item out of a container, they have a 50% chance of drawing a live bird instead. The bird's starting attitude toward the target is hostile, and will react appropriately to being drawn out by its ankles (or other part of its body). A bird's body created by this effect disappears if it dies. If you spend an additional spell point when casting this sphere effect, the target always draws the same live bird, even if it was killed previously. Drawing this bird causes it to disappear from wherever it was and appear in the target's hands. The bird remembers the target and will behave appropriately, usually becoming angrier with each draw. With enough time, some birds may realize peace was never an option."

    "hunger (ghost strike)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that saps a creature of its energy (Will negates). On a failed save, the subject is fatigued and takes nonlethal damage equal to 1d8 per caster level. This is considered starvation damage, and as such the fatigue and nonlethal damage cannot be healed, even by magic, until the target consumes some sort of food (a standard action, assuming the food is on hand and need not be dug out of a backpack first). If no food is available, the target begins to attempt Constitution checks per day as normal for starvation. Multiple applications of hunger do not stack; only the highest nonlethal damage applies."
    },
    "inflict disease (ghost strike)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that causes the target to contract a disease (Fortitude negates). The subject contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom. The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply). Use the disease's listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects."

    "lich strike (ghost strike) [gravecaller's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may make a ghost strike that emulates the power of a lich's touch, incapacitating the target. The target is staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 4 caster levels (Fortitude negates). If you spend 2 additional spell points, the target is instead paralyzed for 1 round per caster level (Fortitude negates). On a successful save to avoid paralysis, the target is instead staggered for 1 round. A target paralyzed by this ghost strike is allowed a new Fortitude save each round to end this effect early. This is a fullround action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A creature paralyzed by the Lich Strike talent seems dead, though a Perception check (DC 15 + caster level) or Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 caster level) reveals that the creature is still alive."

You may also spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that, when it strikes a target below 0 hit points, kills it instantly (Will negates). If the target fails their saving throw, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the target's Hit Dice, as well as a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, which increases by +2 for every 8 Hit Dice the target possesses. These effects last for 10 minutes per Hit Die of the slain creature. Bonuses from multiple creatures do not stack; only the highest bonuses apply."

    "poltergeist (ghost strike)": {
      "benefits": "You may make a ghost strike that attaches a vengeful poltergeist to the target, disrupting their actions. Whenever the target makes a d20 roll within 1 round per caster level, you can choose for them take a -3 penalty to the roll, ending this effect. This penalty is increased by 1 for every 6 caster levels you have. If you spend a spell point when you use this ghost strike, you can impose the penalty on up to one d20 roll the target makes each round for the effect's duration, and imposing the penalty does not end the effect. A creature can only be affected by one poltergeist at a time."

You may bring up to 1 additional willing creature per 2 caster levels with you, provided these creatures are linked in a circle with you at the time. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. Unlike a regular use of the Project Spirit talent, you and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane in this manner indefinitely, until you either choose to end the effect (which returns you to your body) or it is ended by some outside means. This effect may be dispelled like any other sphere effect by targeting either your astral form or your physical body. Dispelling this effect immediately returns you to your body."

If you choose to enter one of these planes, you form a new physical body (and equipment) on that plane of existence, exactly like your true form, although the silver cord remains invisibly attached to this new body, and magic items used still count against the item's total uses. You are still subject to the weaknesses of an astral form (you may be dispelled, your cord may be broken, etc.).

    "create soul gem [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Death sphere, caster level 5th. You draw forth the ebbing life force of a dying creature or one that has died in the past round, transforming it into a soul gem. The target must be within range of your ghost strike in order for you to use this ability on them (or within close range if you do not possess the ability to use ghost strike). If the creature is dying but alive and fails its saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, it can still resist this effect by attempting a Will save as if it were still alive. The value of the soul gem created depends on the nature of the creature it is made from (see below). Soul gems created by this effect crumble to dust after 1 day per caster level, releasing the trapped soul to travel on to the afterlife. Only one soul gem can be created from a dying creature. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a magical skill check against your MSD. Failure results in the resurrection having no effect, while success shatters the target's soul gem and returns the creature to life as normal. If you possess the Death sphere Soul Trap advanced talent, you may transfer a soul contained in a soul gem into an appropriate gemstone as a standard action by spending 3 spell points. If a creature does not possess a soul, they are unaffected by this talent. If a creature's soul is already pledged to another entity such as a god or outsider, said entity may seek to reclaim the soul somehow. The Value of Souls Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). It is worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice may be considered evil or an affront to the natural order in certain settings unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within). Life Force:  A souls' life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested x 1000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature is 1000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp. Age:  A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no Intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp. Flavor:  As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of a chaotic good deity might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly to chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way. A soul's value can be used as currency when purchasing favors from outsiders or may be used as the materials to craft items. Other uses such as spell, ritual, or incantation components may exist at GM discretion. Oath of Loyalty and Souls When a being who has sworn an Oath of Loyalty dies, the being or organization which they have sworn the Oath of Loyalty to (referred to as the claimant) may claim the character's soul. A claimed soul cannot be resurrected by any means short of a wish or miracle spell (unless the claimant wishes otherwise) and the claimant is automatically aware of any successful resurrection of a soul they have claimed. A claimed soul resurrected in this way is considered to have forsworn any Oaths of Loyalty they have previously sworn."

Additionally, you may apply much more powerful curses to the target, examples of which are outlined below: Curse of Ages:  The target ages 1 year every day. Daybane:  The target suffers 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every minute of exposure to bright light, including daylight. This does not become lethal damage if the target falls unconscious. Dayblind:  The target is blind except in dim light or darkness. Famine:  Any food that the target attempts to consume instantly rots into a putrescent mass. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to choke down the spoiled food. If the target fails at the check, she takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. In either case, attempting to consume food leaves the target sickened and unable to eat for 1d4 hours. Food created by magic can resist spoilage with a successful magic skill check against the DC of the curse. Font of Truth:  The target is unable to intentionally lie. In addition, anytime the target is asked a question, she must succeed at a Will save or answer in exacting, truthful detail. The target receives an additional save once per minute to cease elaborating upon her answer. Insanity:  The target gains either amnesia, mania/phobia, multiple personality disorder, paranoia, psychosis, or schizophrenia, as detailed in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Lycanthropy:  The target becomes afflicted with lycanthropy. Ravenous:  The target must attempt a Fortitude save every hour. If it fails, it must eat a full day's worth of food. If sufficient food is not available, starvation advances at the rate of 1 day per failed Fortitude save. Unluck:  Once per hour, the target must reroll one roll (decided by the GM) and take the worse result. Venerable:  The target gains the penalties (but not the benefits) of advancing to the venerable age range. This does not actually increase their age. Vulnerability:  The target gains vulnerability to a single energy type. This has no effect on targets immune to the chosen energy type."

This is always an instantaneous effect, creating permanent undead that cannot be dispelled. The created undead cannot have a challenge rating above 1/2 your caster level, and the created undead are not automatically under your control; alternate means of control must be established. Many undead have specific requirements for their creation listed in their descriptions (banshees are the spirits of female elves who either betrayed a lover or were betrayed by one, bodaks are extraplanar undead created in the Abyss, allips are the spirits of insane suicides, etc.). These prerequisites must be met in order to create a specific kind of undead.

Hollow bodies still require food to survive and become a regular corpse should they die. A hollow body that is dominated or possessed functions as if it had been given the zombie template (or one of the variant zombies creatable through Expanded Necromancy if you possess that talent), save that it lacks undead traits and retains the traits of its original creature type.

If their saving throw fails, the target's soul is repressed, and yours assumes control of the body. You may only possess a physical creature with a soul (this includes most living creatures and intelligent undead but not constructs, unintelligent undead, or outsiders). Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. You may only attempt to possess a creature once during any individual projection of your spirit. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, feats, talents, alignment, mental abilities, extraordinary abilities, supernatural abilities, and magical abilities such as spells and sphere abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You cannot choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. You may possess a body for up to 1 hour per caster level, but may always end the effect early as a standard action.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Death sphere, caster level 10th. You may spend a spell point to project your spirit out of your body for up to 1 round per caster level. During this time, your body falls into a state of suspended animation; it requires neither food nor water and does not age, although it may be slain through normal means. Your spirit manifests as an ethereal version of you with your hit points and abilities, and carries a copy of all of your equipment. It is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. It can move through solid objects, including living creatures, and may see and hear its surroundings, although as it is on the Ethereal Plane, it can only see and hear the Material Plane to a distance of 60 feet. When the time limit expires, your spirit immediately returns to your body. Using magic items (such as scrolls, wands, potions, and other items with a limited number of charges or uses per day) while ethereal counts against the item's total remaining uses when you return to your body. Your spirit cannot attack or otherwise affect creatures and objects on the Material Plane nor generally be affected by them, although some effects (such as force damage) specifically target ethereal creatures when used by material creatures. Certain material creatures or objects also have attacks or effects that can specifically affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane. These effects do not work in reverse to allow your spirit to affect material creatures. Your spirit treats other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. Your spirit may use any magic you possess, but such magic can only affect other ethereal things. If your spirit self is slain, your spirit instantly returns to your body, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels."

    "soul drain": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Death sphere, caster level 5th. Each time you use a ghost strike that does not cause negative levels or immediately kill its target (such as Killing Curse), you can choose for it not to count as a death effect, meaning it can affect creatures normally resistant or immune to death effects, such as outsiders with the daemon subtype. This allows you to affect constructs and undead with your ghost strikes. Such creatures gain a +4 bonus to any granted saving throw, and may still be immune to the effects caused by your ghost strike (disease, etc.)."
    },
    "soul trap": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Death sphere, caster level 15th. As a standard action, when adjacent to a creature that has died very recently (within 1 round per caster level) you may spend 3 spell points to trap their soul into a gem. The target is allowed a Will save to negate the effect, and the gemstone's value must be at least 1,000 gp per Hit Die of the creature you are attempting to trap. If successful, the creature's soul becomes trapped within the gemstone. A trapped creature cannot be resurrected or have its spirit summoned, unless the caster is in possession of this gemstone. The creature trapped inside the gemstone always fails its saving throws if the holder of the gemstone uses the Summon Spirit advanced Death talent on it. If the gemstone is broken, the spirit is released. If the spirit is called through the Summon Spirit advanced Death talent, the caster may choose to release the spirit, in which case it travels to the afterlife, leaving the gem empty and reusable."
    },
    "summon spirit": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Death sphere, caster level 5th. You may spend 3 spell points and 1 hour to summon the spirit of a dead creature. You must know the exact creature you are trying to summon and be able to designate them (such as their name or place and time of death, etc.) and the more familiar you are with the spirit and the more recently they died, the more likely they are to appear. The spirit you are trying to summon is allowed a Will save with the following modifiers depending on your knowledge and connection to the target, as well as its time of death: Table: Familiarity (Spirit) Knowledge \n Will Save Modifier \n \n \n None^ \n +10 \n \n \n Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) \n +5 \n \n \n Firsthand (you have met the subject) \n +0 \n \n \n Familiar (you know the subject well) \n -5 ^You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature of which you have no knowledge. Table: Connection (Spirit) Connection \n Will Save Modifier \n \n \n Likeness or picture \n -2 \n \n \n Possession or garment \n -4 \n \n \n Corpse/remains \n -10 Table: Time Deceased Time the Creature has been Dead \n Will Save Modifier \n \n \n 1 year \n +2 \n \n \n 10 years \n +4 \n \n \n 100 years \n +6 \n \n \n 1000 years \n +8 On a successful saving throw, the target does not appear and may choose to retaliate spiritually, giving you 2 temporary negative levels that last 24 hours (meaning you must save against them becoming permanent). While friends may choose to purposefully fail their saving throw and come willingly, in most other cases being ripped from the afterlife is a horrid experience and can turn even the nicest of spirits hostile. If a spirit succeeds at their saving throw against this effect they cannot be summoned again by the same caster for 1 month. Sometimes, the spirits of heroes, kings, and others are protected by a deity and are simply unable to be summoned. Once a spirit has been summoned, you may do any of the following: You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive. A creature who would have opposed you in life may attempt a new Will save to refuse to answer or to lie with the Bluff skill. \n You may use the spirit as a component when creating an animated object or undead creature (Will negates if unwilling; if the spirit succeeds at its save, it immediately returns to the afterlife as if it had made its original saving throw). You must create the undead creature or animated object as usual, but by placing the spirit into the target, the spirit is brought back to life within this new body. The object or undead creature gains the mental attributes, personality, memories, etc. of the selected spirit, but otherwise is normal for its new creature type. (At the GM's discretion, a spirit bound to a permanent animated object or undead creature may recover or gain class levels over time, but loses at least 1 level per CR of its new form.) An undead creature or animated object created in this way is not automatically under your control. \n If you possess the Resurrection advanced Life talent, you may place the spirit into a new body, bringing the soul back to life, even if you do not have the target's body, it is missing vital components, or the target has been dead for longer than the time limit. You must possess either a soulless body (such as one created through the Fleshcraft and Create Materials advanced Creation talents), or else a body assembled from other, recently slain bodies. (Assembly requires either the target's body with one additional body for every replaced vital component, or else a minimum of six different bodies\u2014one for each limb, the torso including head, and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required.) You may bring the target back to life with the Resurrection advanced Life talent. The target retains its ability scores and class levels (even those dependent on blood, such as sorcerer levels) but its race and appearance depend on the body possessed. Death Sphere Feats"

    "anemic wounds": {
      "benefits": "Foes find the wounds you inflict hard to heal. Prerequisites:  Death sphere (Bleeding Wounds (ghost strike)). Benefit:  Magical healing does not stop your bleed effects unless their caster succeeds at a magical skill check against you. Healing from class features (such as lay on hands) use their class level as their MSB for this purpose. In addition, the DC needed to remove your bleed effects with the Heal skill increases by an amount equal to your caster level."

    "animating possession (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "You can project your soul into an object to give it a semblance of life. Prerequisites:  Death sphere (Master's Presence), Enhancement sphere (Animate Object (enhance)). Benefit:  When you use Animate Object, you may automatically possess the object as the Possession advanced talent. Your animated object always willingly fails its saving throw against this effect. You do not have to share a space with them, and you may possess the object despite it being a construct. In addition, you can shift concentration of a single Enhancement sphere ability or effect to an undead you control as a free action. If its concentration is broken (using your concentration modifier), the enhancement is ended as normal."

Benefit:  When you use control weather to create or control Precipitation of severity 4 or more, you may choose to spend 2 additional spell points. If you do, you may reanimate any number of corpses within the area of controlled weather each round as a move action without paying the base ability spell point cost.

Benefit:  You may use your word abilities as ghost strikes (using your Death sphere caster level to determine range and number of targets but your Fate sphere caster level for any other effects). Additionally, when you reanimate one or more targets, you may target them with a single word ability as a free action. If the undead creatures are maintained through concentration (such as through the Sustained Reanimation talent), you may concentrate on this word and the reanimation as part of the same action."

Benefit:  You can spend a use of your channel energy ability as a standard action to detonate a mindless undead you control within 30 feet (or your dominion range, whichever is greater), destroying it, but causing your channel energy to burst outwards from its location; your channel deals (or heals, as appropriate) 1 additional point of damage per Hit Die of the undead sacrificed. You can activate this ability as an immediate action whenever a mindless undead you control is reduced to 0 hit points by spending a spell point (and a use of channel energy, as normal)."

Benefit:  You may give simple commands to undead under the control of an ally who also possesses this feat; if they receive conflicting orders, they act under their controller's orders. In addition, if at any time you would fall unconscious or be dropped to 0 hit points or less, you may choose to transfer any undead you have control over to another ally with this teamwork feat for 1 minute (or their normal maximum duration, whichever is shorter). Transferred undead may be returned to their owner during this time period as a move action, but can never be transferred to a third ally. After the duration expires, they are considered under your ally's control and count towards your ally's maximum Hit Dice total of undead they can have reanimated at once."

      "benefits": "The otherworldly are called like the departed, for little distinguishes the transient soul. Prerequisites:  Conjuration sphere (Undead Creature (type) x2), Death sphere. Benefit:  A companion that possesses the Undead Creature (type) talent taken twice counts as an undead you reanimated and control for the purpose of Death sphere talents, such as Empowered Reanimate, Reanimated Warriors, and Tomb Of Flesh. A Conjuration companion cannot be destroyed or sacrificed by your effects (such as the Dark Sacrifice talent) or the target of effects which would alter or merge corpses (such as the Death sphere Corpse Manipulation talent or Corpse Forge advanced talent). If you possess the Conjuration sphere Call The Departed talent, you may reduce the spell point cost to use call the departed by 1 (minimum 0) by using a recently slain corpse within your Conjuration sphere summon range as an additional material component. A corpse used this way must be one that was recently slain (usually within one hour) and has a CR greater than or equal to 1/2 your Conjuration sphere caster level. When a corpse is used as a material component with this feat, the corpse becomes a drained husk that cannot be reanimated or used as a material component to re-summon your companion again with this feat."

You may choose whether or not to deal negative energy damage to your absorbed creatures or not, but must make the same choice for all absorbed creatures. If you possess Necrotic Feeding, when a creature within your Tomb Of Flesh dies you may target it with a Necrotic Feeding ghost strike as an immediate action, spending a spell point as usual. If the target fails its saving throw against this ghost strike, you may absorb its entire corpse into you, increasing the duration of your Necrotic Feeding bonus to hours per Hit Die rather than 10 minutes per Hit Die.

    "lifebound auspician [gravecaller's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You bend the forces of the cosmos to the heartbeat of mortality. \n Prerequisites:  Fate sphere; Death sphere or Life sphere; caster level 3rd. Benefits:  Whenever a Fate sphere effect you create would use an alignment, you may instead choose living or undead. Living and undead are considered opposite alignments that are 3 steps away from each other and do not have an alignment aura (such as determining additional penalties to the saving throw associated with the Enmity (word) talent or the Reveal Alignment (consecration) revealing whether the creatures inside are living or dead). You must possess the Death sphere to choose living or the Life sphere to choose undead. You may treat yourself as either living or undead when creating a consecration to exclude yourself from its effects (as you would normally be your own alignment and unaffected). In addition, whenever you use the Serendipity consecration, you may modify it with one of the following: Living Bastion (requires Life sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to sacred and only grants bonuses to living creatures (or penalizes undead creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any living creature healed by a magical effect inside this consecration heals up to an additional +1 hit point per Hit Dice they possess (to a maximum of the original amount healed). \n Unliving Bastion (requires Death sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to profane and only grants bonuses to undead (or penalizes living creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any undead created inside this consecration gains an additional +1 hit points per Hit Dice they possess. Sphere effects modified with this feat are still treated as the original talent for all purposes, and as such, do not stack with those same talents unmodified by this feat. This prevents a character from benefiting from both the Hallow (word) against evil and the Hallow (word) against undead, as modified by this feat, against the same target or effect. Likewise, a regular Serendipity consecration and the Living Bastion-modified Serendipity consecration's effects would not stack, despite granting different bonus types. Note:  For the purposes of this feat, a living creature is any creature with a Constitution score. Example:  A Fate sphere caster uses the Divine Force (consecration) talent. Instead of using the Fate sphere caster's alignment, the caster chooses living and affects any undead, regardless of their alignment, and does not affect living creatures. That same caster uses the Enmity (word) talent, choosing undead and targeting a living creature. The living creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or be blinded as though their alignment were 3 steps away from the caster's."

Benefit:  You may choose to have any piecemeal undead under your control count as animated objects for the purposes of your Enhancement sphere talents, feats, and other abilities, but count them against both the total number of Hit Dice you can have reanimated and as animated objects. You must decide to treat a piecemeal undead as an animated object when it is first created.

If you do, you are immediately reanimated as a fast zombie as if you had reanimated yourself, except you possess Hit Dice equal to your racial Hit Dice plus your class level, and your duration is equal to the number of rounds of rage you spent to use this ability. You gain all passive benefits and detriments of your rage despite being undead, and may still use rage powers. Each round, you must attempt to kill the creatures that killed you to the best of your ability, (as determined by the GM), or the duration immediately expires. When the duration expires (assuming you were not destroyed while a fast zombie), you are returned to life with -1 hit points (stable), gaining 2 temporary negative levels that last 24 hours.

If you possess the Gravetongue talent, you gain the benefits of Gravetongue as a constant supernatural effect. If you possess the Summon Spirit talent, you no longer suffer negative energy levels when a spirit succeeds against your summoning.

Variant undead created with this feat are reanimated with the Expanded Necromancy talent. Each variant undead has an associated sphere. If you do not possess the associated sphere, you must spend an additional spell point when reanimating that variant. If you possess the Corpse Forge advanced talent, variant undead with a fixed number of Hit Dice, such as the beheaded or isitoq, may be reanimated with a number of Hit Dice equal to the corpse used (such as using a 5 Hit Dice corpse to create a 5 Hit Dice isitoq, instead of the default 1 Hit Die isitoq). You may reanimate the following variant undead: Beheaded:  You may reanimate beheaded (Pathfinder Bestiary 4) using an intact head.  Associated Sphere:  Telekinesis. \n Exoskeleton:  You may reanimate exoskeletons (Pathfinder Bestiary 6) using a mostly intact vermin corpse that has an exoskeleton, such as arachnids, crustaceans, insects, and mollusks, but not soft-bodied vermin such as jellyfish and leeches.

At GM discretion, other variants of skeletons or zombies and other similar undead may be appropriate to reanimate with this feat. Special:  If you possess the Undead Animal Companion feat, you may grant your animal companion one of the undead templates available from this feat (exoskeleton, frostfallen, sunbaked) in addition to the options added by Expanded Necromancy. Note:  The options presented by this feat were curated from the miscellaneous unintelligent undead variants which required rituals, specific components, or other special circumstances to be reanimated, such as the preparation rites required to reanimate a sunbaked zombie. As such, they were not considered a \"normal\" variant akin to a bloody skeleton or fast zombie. Without the Strange Corpsecraft feat, these undead are normally only accessible through the Greater Undead advanced talent. GMs are encouraged to allow this feat to raise unintelligent undead variants in their settings which ordinarily require these special circumstances, or similarly bar variants which do not fit their setting (such as raising frostfallen in an Arabian Nights desert setting). Beyond worldbuilding implications, some undead templates are stronger than others. Specifically, the frostfallen template is potentially stronger than even undead available through the Greater Undead advanced talent.

It keeps all special abilities gained as a part of being an animal companion (i.e. evasion) and as a member of their species. For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), it counts as both animal and undead.

In addition, undead you control can benefit from morale bonuses granted by your totems and rallies. Necrosis Feats Necrosis feats represent ongoing necromantic modification, corruption, or experimentation the character has made on her body to bring it closer to undead anatomy. Necrosis feats are distinct from more common feats in two ways. Tainted:  Upon taking a necrosis feat, the character's body becomes contaminated with negative energy. From that point on, if the character dies, returning him to life proves to be more difficult. Any spellcaster who attempts to bring the character back from the dead must attempt a magical skill check (DC = 10 + the slain character's Hit Dice) or have the effect fail. Effects that may only bring a creature back that has died within 1 round (such as the Resuscitate talent) gain a +5 to this check. Each necrosis feat beyond the first increases this DC by 1. Greater Power:  Necrosis feats increase in power relative to the number of necrosis feats a character possesses. Most necrosis feats grant far greater effects to characters with at least four necrosis feats. For necrosis feats that require an immediate action to activate them, you may activate as many necrosis feats as you desire as part of the same immediate action (although you must spend the required spell points for each activated feat). Note:  Characters use their Death sphere caster level when determining the effects of any necrosis feats they possess (such as when determining range) unless otherwise stated."

      "benefits": "Whisper your lamentations to the world. Prerequisite:  Death sphere. Benefit:  You gain +1 spell point. Whenever you speak, you can choose to broadcast your voice to all creatures within a medium range, allowing anyone to hear you speak as though you were adjacent to them. Attempts to muffle your voice through mundane methods (such as covering your mouth, being gagged, etc.) fail to silence you and allow you to provide verbal components through such attempts to silence you, such as those required by the Verbal Casting general drawback. Magical, supernatural, and extraordinary silencing effects still function normally. You can add verbal components when casting any sphere effect with the curse or death descriptor or that deals negative energy damage, causing you to be clearly heard by anyone as though broadcasting your voice. If you do, creatures that can hear you broadcast your voice and fail their saving throw against the sphere effect take a -2 on attack rolls against you for a number of rounds equal to the number of necrosis feats you possess. If the effect does not have a saving throw, an affected creature attempts a Will saving throw against the sphere effect's regular DC instead. Four Necrosis Feats:  When broadcasting your voice, you have greater control over the pitch and distance, from a minimum of 30 feet, to a maximum of long range. If you spend a spell point when adding verbal components to a sphere effect with this feat, creatures who fail their saving throw take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, not just attack rolls against you."

The caster is included in this effect. \n \n \n 57 \n The spirit of a dead ancestor appears behind the caster for 1 hour. This shade is a ghost, but with no magic or touch attacks; it has no ability to interact with the world at all except for speech and sight. There is a 50% chance the ghost will serve and aid the caster as best it can, but otherwise the ancestor is critical of the caster's life choices and will spend the entire time loudly critiquing the caster's decisions, preventing any form of stealth or sleep. \n \n \n 58 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 59 \n (Combat) The caster is stunned for 1 round. \n \n \n 60 \n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d4 + CL/2 points of Strength damage that disappears after 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 61 \n A harmless ghost follows the caster for 10 minutes per caster level, loudly lamenting its fate but taking no other actions.

If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 66 \n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 temporary negative level. This increases to 1d2 negative levels at caster level 5 and by one additional die size every 5 caster levels thereafter. These negative levels last for 1 minute per caster level and cannot cause the creature's negative level total to equal or exceed the creature's Hit Dice. \n \n \n 67 \n All undead creatures within medium range of the target must succeed on a Will save or attack the caster to the best of their ability for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels. This effect applies to any undead created by the triggering effect. \n \n \n 68 \n For 1 day per caster level, one of the caster's limbs (usually an arm) becomes skeletal. This has no mechanical effect, but may cause negative reactions if not concealed. \n \n \n 69 \n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \n \n \n 70 \n (Combat) The caster is dazed for 1 round. \n \n \n 71 \n The caster becomes imperceptible to undead creatures for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 72 \n Undead creatures created by the effect or within close range of the caster when it is cast lose their immunity to mind-affecting effects for 1 hour per caster level. For the purpose of such effects, treat them as if they were the creatures they were in life. \n \n \n 73 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 74 \n The caster emits an aura of pestilence out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, including the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves against disease. \n \n \n 75 \n All creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area must succeed on a Fortitude save or become fatigued. \n \n \n 76 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster becomes unable to control undead creatures by any means. \n \n \n 77 \n For 1 day per caster level, one of the caster's heads becomes skeletal. This has no mechanical effect, but may cause negative reactions if not concealed. \n \n \n 78 \n The caster emits an aura of death out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, excluding the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves versus death effects. \n \n \n 79 \n The caster becomes unable to perceive undead creatures for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 80 \n For 1 round per caster level, the caster emits an aura out to close range that forces all living creatures that end their turn within it to succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 temporary negative level. All negative levels from this effect stack. The caster is excluded from this effect. \n \n \n 81 \n As an instantaneous effect, all dead creatures within long range of the caster are animated as skeletons per the reanimate ability of the Death sphere. The caster has no control over these creatures and they do not count against the number of undead he can active at one time with his reanimate ability. These skeletons are hostile to all living creatures. \n \n \n 82 \n As an instantaneous effect, all dead creatures within long range of the caster are animated as zombies per the reanimate ability of the Death sphere. The caster has no control over these creatures and they do not count against the number of undead he can active at one time with his reanimate ability. These zombies unerringly seek out the caster to attack him until destroyed. \n \n \n 83 \n For 1 hour per caster level, all creatures within long range of the caster when this result is triggered exude the scent of decaying flesh, attracting the attention of carrion feeders and causing most creatures interacting with them to have their disposition drop by one step until the end of this effect. \n \n \n 84 \n The caster is fatigued. \n \n \n 85 \n The caster emits an aura of death out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, including the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves versus death effects. \n \n \n 86 \n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 87 \n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \n \n \n 88 \n The caster and the nearest creature that is a valid target switch bodies for 1 round per caster level. This functions as the Possession advanced talent. \n \n \n 89 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 90 \n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are lost. \n \n \n 91 \n (Combat) All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 92 \n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 93 \n The caster emits an aura of pestilence out to close range for 10 minutes per caster level. All creatures within this area, excluding the caster, take a -2 penalty on all saves against disease. \n \n \n 94 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster emits an aura out to close range that forces all living creatures that end their turn within it to succeed on a Fortitude save or become fatigued. Fatigued creatures are unaffected. The caster is excluded from this effect. \n \n \n 95 \n Wailing spirits fill an area out to long range of the caster with their cries for 2d4 rounds. All concentration checks within this area suffer a penalty equal to half caster level (minimum 1) and all spells with verbal components suffer a 10% chance of failure. Deaf creatures are immune to this effect. \n \n \n 96 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 97 \n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 98 \n The caster is exhausted. \n \n \n 99 \n (Combat) All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Fortitude save or be sickened 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 100 \n All corpses within long range of the caster (other than those targeted by the triggering effect) become undead per reanimate for 1 round per caster level. These undead are helpful toward the caster. Gamemastering Necromancy and Morality When you are a living creature, death can be scary. Death is the end of the world we know. For many people, this association between fear and death often leads to avoidance and disgust of all things connected with death - corpses, graveyards, mortuaries, and the like - and a mistrust of those that willing associate themselves with such things. As widespread as these attitudes are, there are people, cultures, and worlds with other ways of conceptualizing their relationship with death. What follows are three possible ways to handle this situation, though they are not mutually exclusive: A GM could create multiple sources of power over undeath and allow players to choose between them."

    "death sphere as neutral": {
      "benefits": "For the rules closest to those presented in the base Spheres of Power book, the following suggestions are made: Creatures of all alignments may reanimate undead to accomplish their goals. Skeletons and zombies are always neutral, and do not automatically attack the living when uncontrolled. Classes that channel positive or negative energy (such as a cleric or soul weaver) may choose which kind of energy they channel regardless of alignment; once this choice has been made, it cannot be changed. Abilities that channel positive energy still harm undead."
    },
    "death sphere as evil": {
      "benefits": "For those wanting to integrate the Death sphere into their campaigns with morality judgements the same as the cleric and wizard's spellcasting, the following suggestions are made: The reanimate ability gains the [evil] descriptor. Creating undead is a grievous act of evil that requires atonement. Ghost strikes that create disease, immediately kill a living creature (such as Killing Curse or Necrotic Feeding), possess, or trap a soul gain the [evil] descriptor. Skeletons and zombies are always neutral evil."
    },
    "death sphere as lawful": {
      "benefits": "For an alternate world-building seed, consider a world in which a judge-like god of the dead and community rules necromantic magic: The reanimate ability gains the [lawful] descriptor. To create an undead is to honor the life and work of a person and deem them worthy of reanimation. To continue to use the reanimate ability, a caster must maintain the favor of the deity. This includes participating in a ritual feast at least once each year in which the forebears of a community are awakened to walk the streets to inspire the living and renew collective identity. Skeletons and zombies are always lawful neutral. Access to items and abilities that allow living creatures to be healed by negative energy are widespread. Necromancy and Society When including necromantic players, NPCs, and activity in your games, remember that people don't have to base their opinions on necromancy purely on alignment. A good or neutral metropolis might allow necromancers to practice in their university - even in a world where raising the dead is utterly evil - to allow other casters to keep an eye on their activity and not excessively provoke them. Even in a world where the Death sphere is neutral, a farming community might be fine with an adventuring party reanimating the bandits that were harassing them, but might object to raiding the mausoleum and leaving with the remains of their ancestors. Wrestling with the complicated ethical questions or reveling in the moral gray areas situations like these provide is often one of the attractions of playing a necromancer. Creating robust and varied attitudes towards undead will give your players more chances to engage in the roleplaying side of walking around with a bag of bones. Here are some sample ideas: Venerated:  Undead and those who can create them hold the highest positions in society. Powerful forces within the setting may attempt to ally with necromantic PCs to gain credibility or attempt to quietly dispose of them to nip a new rival in the bud. Regulated:  Undead are welcome, but must be registered with the proper authorities, have a license from the authorities, and pay nominal dues. Some undead (particularly those that can replicate themselves violently) may be outlawed entirely. Sophisticated systems to detect and control undead exist. Chain gangs of zombies pull huge wagons for public transportation or turn mills to grind grain. Curiosities:  Undead are extremely uncommon on nonexistent in this area. Reactions vary: Friendly questions, amused denial, or deep suspicion are all likely. Death magic might just be poorly understood - or it might be suppressed by nearby arcane energies. Contraband:  Undead are a hot, illegal commodity. Labor might be scarce, or work might need to be done that is impossible for the living (mining at the bottom of a lake, hauling toxic cargo, etc.). Having a necromancer is as vital for a criminal group as having a lockpick or a fence. Their legal status might be due to the origin of the corpses, the use of the undead, past tragedy, or religious tension. Craftsmanship:  Creating undead is seen as a form of expression, similar to music or sculpture. Pristine, sparkling skeletons in royal regalia stand at key points, ready for a use of Necrotic Senses to quickly observe distant locations. Ballets involving dozens of elaborately-costumed zombies are popular entertainment. Hunted:  Out of hatred, duty, or sport, a cabal of undead-hunters scours the area. They may or may not care about apprehending the necromancer behind the reanimation, so long as they're able to take down their quarry."

    "exhausting strike [core]": {
      "benefits": "The Necromancer's Handbook \n$4.99 The subject of your ghost strike becomes fatigued for 1 round per caster level (Fortitude negates). You may spend a spell point to increases this effect to making the target exhausted for 1 minute per caster level (Fortitude negates). On a successful save, the target is still fatigued for 1 round. Unlike regular fatigue and exhaustion, these conditions end as soon as the duration expires. Reanimate [Core] As a standard action, you may touch an intact dead body and spend a spell point to reanimate it as a zombie or skeleton (depending on the composition of the body in question) for 1 minute per caster level. This creature gains the zombie or skeleton template and obeys your commands, although only simple commands such as \"go\", \"stay\", \"attack\", or \"guard\" are understandable. A reanimated body cannot speak and has no knowledge or ability to think and so cannot answer questions or reveal anything it knew in life. When the duration expires, the body collapses until reanimated again. It does not regain hit points between reanimations. If reduced to 0 hp, the body collapses and is destroyed; it cannot be reanimated again. You may have a total number of reanimated creatures active at any one time whose combined Hit Dice does not exceed twice your caster level. If you attempt to reanimate a creature that would push your total beyond this limit, your reanimated creatures cease to be reanimated sequentially from oldest to newest until the Hit Dice total is low enough to permit the new reanimated creature. You cannot reanimate a creature with more Hit Dice than twice your caster level, and creatures with more than 20 racial Hit Dice can never become skeletons or zombies. Death Talents"

Commanding undead to make basic use of their skills (such as crafting with the Craft skill or performing music with the Perform skill) does not require a specific trick.

You can give an intelligent undead creature orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks this effect.

This increases by 1 die size per 5 caster levels (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, and 1d6). Unlike with other ghost strikes, negative levels stack. While normally negative levels have a chance to become permanent and can kill a target whose negative levels equal its Hit Dice, these negative levels do not last long enough to become permanent, and if a negative level would reduce the creature to 0 Hit Dice, the creature instead takes 4 points of Constitution drain for the duration of the effect. If a negative level lasts longer than 1 day, the target must pass a Fortitude save per negative level or have the negative level become permanent. If this ability is used on an undead creature, it instead grants the creature 5 temporary hit points per negative level, which last for 1 hour."

The resultant blast does half of its damage of each type and any additional effects of the blast types are applied normally. If the die size for the two blasts are d8 and d6, use d8; if d8 and d4 use d6; if d6 and d4, use d4. If two blast types have different caster levels, then use the lower caster level for determining the admixtured blast's caster level.

      "benefits": "You may choose to have all damage dealt by a destructive blast be nonlethal damage. Damage dealt is calculated as if the destructive blast was its original damage type as well as nonlethal (for example, an acid blast would still be subject to acid resistance), but the resulting damage is added to the target's nonlethal damage total and not subtracted from their hit points. When using a (blast type) talent that already deals nonlethal damage, your destructive blast damage increases by +1 damage per die. Alternatively, you may choose to deal no damage at all, only inflicting secondary effects, such as from (blast type) talents, or only expressing minor, controlled effects of the damage type you would normally deal with your destructive blast. For example, you might create a spark with a Fire Blast, drive a nail into wood with the bludgeoning force of a standard destructive blast, or make an indistinct sound with a Thunder Blast. These effects should never be powerful, and the GM is the final arbiter of what can be accomplished this way."

Anything other than an inanimate object struck by this kind of destructive blast only takes half damage from it."

Using a destructive blast to make an attack of opportunity is considered a (blast shape), and you cannot use any effects that would increase its casting time, nor spend a spell point to increase its damage. Using your destructive blast this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity for the casting, though it may still provoke if used to make ranged attacks.

    "blast salvo (blast shape) [bap]": {
      "benefits": "Instead of a single destructive blast, you unleash a volley of destructive power. You deliver 2 surges, each requiring a melee touch attack or a ranged touch attack within range. A ranged surge counts as a ray attack. Each surge may be delivered at the same or different targets, but all surges must be delivered simultaneously. Determine the damage dealt by each surge by distributing the damage dice dealt by your destructive blast between each surge. A surge must deal at least 1 damage die or you do not create that surge. If you spend an additional spell point, you may deliver one additional surge, plus 1 surge for every 6 caster levels you possess. Even if this (blast shape) damages a target more than once, this (blast shape) only counts as damaging a target once for the purposes of (blast type) effects and the Cascade Failure talent. Additional effects from a destructive blast modified with this blast shape only affect a creature once regardless of how many times they are damaged. Example:  A destructive blast which deals 7d6 damage could be distributed between the two surges as 3d6 and 4d6, 1d6 and 6d6, or any combination the caster chooses. Each surge must deal at least 1d6 damage, or the caster does not create it and the burst is lost. A caster would only make a single disarm attempt against a creature struck multiple times by this blast shape when modified by the Static Blast blast type, and only applies additional effects from the Admixture talent or admixture feats to the damaged creature a single time. Effects not caused by the destructive blast, such as additional damage caused by the Fate sphere Harm (word), would trigger on each successful surge. Additional damage from other sources (such as the bonus damage from the Primal Blast feat) would apply to each surge. Sneak attack is never applied multiple times, as per the normal Paizo FAQ on spells and sneak attack, regardless of whether you are delivering melee or ranged surges. Author's Note: - Blast Salvo and Spell Combat  The Blast Salvo talent cannot be used alongside a magus's spell strike to deliver multiple surges; surges must be used as part of the same initial action (either casting, the initial spellstrike, etc.) or are lost. This talent is otherwise meant to be an analog to scorching ray with a melee option, not chill touch, and is not synergistic with spell combat or similar abilities."

    "blast trap (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may place a destructive blast onto an adjacent, unoccupied 5-foot square. Any creature who steps onto that square is affected by your destructive blast, and is allowed a Reflex save for half damage. A blast trap lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before becoming inert. This is a magical trap with a Perception DC and Disable Device DC equal to the blast's save DC. You may have one active blast trap at a time, +1 per 10 caster levels; placing a trap beyond this limit deactivates an earlier trap of your choice."
    },
    "chain blast (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to arc your destructive blast between multiple targets. Choose a number of targets no greater than 1 + half your caster level (minimum 2 targets total). Make a ranged touch attack against each of them in order. No target can be farther than 10 ft + 5 ft per 5 CL from the previous target and no target can be targeted more than once. Should any of the targets fail to take damage, either by a missed attack, resistance, or other method, the chain stops and no further targets are damaged."
    },
    "energy aura (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to surround yourself with elemental energies as a move action. For a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier, any creature that ends its turn within 5 ft + 5 ft per 10 caster levels of you is affected by your destructive blast as if it had dealt minimum damage (so a 4d6 blast would deal 4 damage). A Reflex save negates this damage. You may only have one energy aura active at a time; casting it again ends the previous instance."

    "energy bomb (blast shape) [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may touch a small container of liquid and spend a spell point to instill a destructive blast inside it. As a standard action, this can be primed and thrown as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals the destructive blast's damage to the target and damage equal to the minimum blast damage is dealt in a 5-foot splash radius. Any creature taking damage from either the direct hit or the splash must save against any additional effects of the blast type. This cannot be used with the Gather Energy talent. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food (in which instead of a splash weapon it affects the target who consumes it) but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "energy leap (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to move in a straight line up to your destructive blast's range as a standard action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and you may pass through occupied spaces.

      "benefits": "You may spend 1 spell point to form your destructive blast into 1 satellite that orbits your body that lasts for one minute per caster level or until discharged. This cannot be combined with Gather Energy or spending a spell point to increase the destructive blast's damage. You may maintain 1 satellite at a time + 1 additional satellite per 10 caster levels. You may increase the casting time when using this (blast shape) by 1 step in order to form multiple satellites (up to your normal maximum). You may select different (blast types) for each satellite formed this way, spending any additional spell points or costs required. As an immediate action, you may discharge a single satellite, targeting any creature within 5 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels to deal your destructive blast damage (Reflex half)."

    "energy sphere (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may shape your destructive blast into a non-instantaneous sphere that fills a 5-foot square. Any creature within this space is dealt damage from your destructive blast (Reflex negates). This sphere has a 20 feet fly speed + 5 feet per 2 caster levels and perfect maneuverability, and wind does not affect its course. The sphere has a duration of concentration, but you may spend a spell point to increase this duration to 1 round per caster level. As a move action, you may direct this sphere to move to a new location and strike a new target. Your sphere stops to attempt to deal damage whenever it enters a space with a creature, and cannot attempt to directly damage more than one target in this manner per round. Your sphere has no mass and does not impede movement, but creatures moving through its space must succeed at a Reflex save or suffer damage. Your sphere must stay within your destructive blast range or disappear."

    "energy strike (blast shape) [strike]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with making a destructive blast. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also struck by the destructive blast. If using a scatter weapon, the blast only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack."

    "energy tether (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may send out a tendril of energy to bind your foe to you. Make a ranged touch attack against a target within Close range (this range does not increase through talents such as Extended Range). If successful, the targets suffers your destructive blast damage. You may concentrate each round to maintain this tether each round, or may spend a spell point as a free action to allow it to persist for 1 round per caster level without concentration. Each round a target remains bound by the tether, they suffer its damage. The tether has 10 HP plus 2 HP per caster level, hardness equal to 1/2 your caster level, and a break DC equal to the blast's DC. Neither you nor the tethered target may not move further away from each other without first breaking the tether (you may dismiss a tether as a free action) or succeeding on a drag or reposition combat maneuver, pulling the other along with them. If you or the tethered target move closer to each other you may, as a swift action, shorten the tether; the new distance between you becomes the new length of the tether. You may also lengthen the tether as a swift action, but only to a maximum distance equal to Close range. Swarms may not be targeted with this blast shape. You cannot have more than one tether active at any one time; creating a second tether dismisses the first."

    "energy wall (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may craft your destructive blast into a 5-foot-by-5-foot cubic wall with a duration of concentration, so long as it is fully contained within your destructive blast range. You may spend a spell point to increase this effect and create a wall up to 20 feet high and up to 20 feet wide per caster level in a straight line, or a hemisphere with a radius up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels (minimum 5 feet). If used in either way, the duration increases to 1 round per caster level. The wall does not block line of effect, line of sight, projectiles, or thrown objects.

You may create up to a close-range line emanating from yourself but excluding yourself which travels half the total distance again at the end of its length at a 90 degree angle. Creatures in the effect are allowed a Reflex saving throw for half damage. For example, you may fire a knight's blast which travels 40 feet forward, then turns 90 degrees and travels 20 feet left, right, up, or down. Special:  If you possess the Energy Leap talent, when you use the Energy Leap blast shape, at the end of your movement, you may spend an additional spell point to move half the total distance traveled again at a 90 degree angle."
    },
    "mutable blast (blast shape)": {
      "benefits": "You may give your destructive blast any array of strange shapes, as you require. Making a mutable blast costs 1 additional spell point.

By spending a spell point, you may perform a rebuff as an immediate action, or provide the benefits to all targets within 10-foot of you + 5 feet per 5 caster levels.

You may make a bull rush as a free action at range against the target or targets struck by your air blast or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required. Your CMB for this check is your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and all targets are pushed from the point of origin of the effect. (This is usually yourself, but if using a talent such as Explosive Orb, it would be the center of the blast. If using Energy Wall, each square of wall is considered the center of effect for those who enter that section. If using Guided Strike, you may choose from which direction you want to push the target, even pushing them up or down if you should desire. Pushing a target into the ground knocks them prone if the bull rush is successful.)

Any creature struck by the attack or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and unable to move. In addition, the target's square (or the blast's affected area) becomes overgrown with crystal and counts as difficult terrain. Breaking free of the entangled condition is a move action, requiring either a Strength check or an Escape Artist check against the crystal blast's save DC.

You may make a drag combat maneuver as a free action at range against any creature struck by the attack or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required. Your CMB for this check is your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and all targets are dragged towards the point of origin of the effect. You do not move with the targets of your drag. Targets are typically dragged towards the caster, but if using a talent such as Explosive Orb, the point of origin is the center of the blast. If using Energy Wall, each square of wall is considered the point of origin for those who enter that section. If using Guided Strike, you may choose which direction to pull the target, even pushing them up or down. A target pulled into the ground, or a horizontal surface, is knocked prone if they would have continued past the surface. If the target is knocked into a solid object, they suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage, +1d6 for every 5 feet they would have continued past the solid object.

When you use Admixture or Greater Admixture in conjunction with this talent to fire a blast salvo, you may spend 1 additional spell point to cause each surge fired as part of the blast salvo to use a different blast type or Admixture feat for the purpose of determining its effects (as with the Split Blast talent, any surge which applies the effect of a sphere besides the Destruction sphere may deal no damage at the caster's discretion). A target is only affected by non-damage effects and non-destruction sphere-effects on the first three surges to strike them as part of a blast salvo (for example, if a ghost strike admixture surge and a Frost Blast surge were both to strike the same target which has already been struck by two surges, said target would only have to save against either the stagger effect of Frost Blast or the effects of the ghost strike). When using this talent, you do not need to pay additional spell points for using Admixture feats beyond the cost of the effect that they are applying (such as a ghost strike which may cost 1 or more spell points on its own). When using Greater Admixture in conjunction with this talent to fire a blast salvo in which each surge only carries a single blast type, you may spend 2 spell points to fire one additional surge plus another per two caster levels rather than per six caster levels."

When using the Crystal Blast or Living Crystal Blast talent, you may spend an extra spell point to fully encase your targets in a shell of crystal. Targets that fail their Reflex saves against your destructive blast are helpless and cannot take physical actions other than to attempt Strength or Escape Artist checks to escape the crystal, but can still breathe and take purely mental actions. The crystal blocks line of sight and line of effect to and from the encased target. Destroying the cocoon frees the victim, the crystal having hit points as normal for the Crystal Blast and Living Crystal Blast talent."

    "disintegrate (blast type)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere, caster level 5th. You may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast deal untyped damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. This blast type does full damage to objects and ignores all hardness, energy resistance, and energy immunity. When targeting a single object, the destructive blast simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, it disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. Attended objects may attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect, but still take destructive blast damage. The destructive blast affects even objects constructed entirely of force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability, an antimagic field, or a barrier from the Protection sphere."

The cloud obscures vision as the fog cloud spell. Any creatures who begin their turn inside the cloud suffers your destructive blast damage. Affected creatures are allowed a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. You are immune to damage from your own cloud."

    "erratic blast (blast type) [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisite:  Destruction sphere. When you gain this blast type, select 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 blast type talents, no more than one being from each blast type group (you may only select 20 if you possess Admixture feats, see below). You do not need to possess these blast type talents but must meet the prerequisites for any advanced blast type talents selected with this ability. Assign each of these blast types a single number which could be rolled on a d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20 with the die used corresponding to the number of talents you have selected (a d6 if you selected 6, etc.). When you use Erratic Blast, after deciding on your target(s) but before rolling attack rolls or saves, roll a die corresponding to the number of talents selected. Use the talent corresponding to the die roll result to determine the damage die, damage type and additional effects (including feats or class abilities such as Fan The Flames, Frozen To The Bone or elementalist's favored element) to determine the effects of the destructive blast on the target(s). Erratic Blast costs a number of spell points equal to the greatest spell point cost of the blast types selected. If you possess the Admixture talent, you may choose to make the maximum possible value of the die (8 for a d8, for an example) be an admixture of two other blast types which you have selected for the talent. Roll twice more on the table, ignoring any repeat rolls or any further maximum rolls. The next two results rolled are used together as an admixture at no increased spell point cost. If you have the Greater Admixture talent, you instead roll three times and use the next three results rolled for the admixture. You cannot use the Admixture talent with an Erratic Blast. If you possess any Admixture feats, you may select any effects that you could apply to an admixture (such as ghost strikes if you possess Ghostly Admixture). As with (blast type) talents, you need not possess these talents but must meet their prerequisites. If these abilities have variable spell point costs, determine the number of spell points you would spend on each of these effects when you select them as blast types for this talent (for example, you may choose to have your Lich Strike have an effective spell point cost of 1 or 3 for the purpose of determining the cost of an Erratic Blast which incorporates it, with the ghost strike having different effects corresponding to the number of spell points spent). You can change the blast types or admixture effects selected with this talent whenever you level up. For example, Astore is an elementalist with the Admixture talent. He creates the following table to determine the effect of his destructive blast whenever he uses it. As none of the blast types he has selected cost additional spell points, he does not need to spend additional spell points to use Erratic Blast. Table: Astore's Erratic Blast D6 result \n Blast type \n \n \n 1 \n Nether Blast \n \n \n 2 \n Acid Blast \n \n \n 3 \n Crystal Blast \n \n \n 4 \n Electric Blast \n \n \n 5 \n Searing Blast \n \n \n 6 \n Roll twice and admixture both blast types, rerolling any further results of 6"

The damage dealt is split between the three blast types and the additional effects from each blast type apply normally. If different damage die apply to the different types, use the largest. If the blast types have different caster levels, then use the lowest caster level for determining the Admixtured destructive blast's caster level. Special:  You do not increase the casting time or spend an additional spell point when using the admixture talent with blast types from the same blast type group. The additional spell point cost of Greater Admixture still applies. This can be used to apply two Admixture feats to a single destructive blast."

    "radiation blast (blast type, fire, light)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere (any two (blast type) talents in the fire blast type group), caster level 5th. You may spend two additional spell points to have your destructive blast do half fire and half untyped damage. Any creature damaged by the attack must succeed at a Fortitude save with your destructive blast's DC or suffer the effects of low radiation. A creature suffering from radiation instead must succeed at a Fortitude save with your destructive blast's DC or have the level of radiation increased by one step, inflicting the new levels primary effect. This effect stacks with the effects of lower radiation levels. Saves against the secondary effects of the radiation are made at their normal save DCs. The target's square (or the destructive blast's affected area) becomes irradiated for 1 minute per caster level. Any creature passing through an irradiated square must succeed at a Fortitude save DC 14 or be affected by low radiation. Radiation \nRadiation is a poison effect, whose initial effect causes Constitution drain and secondary effect causes Strength damage. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe. Radiation Level \n Fort Save \n Primary Effect \n Secondary Effect \n \n \n Low \n 13 \n 1 Con drain \n 1 Str damage/day \n \n \n Medium \n 17 \n 1d4 Con drain \n 1d4 Str damage/day \n \n \n High \n 22 \n 2d4 Con drain \n 1d6 Str damage/day \n \n \n Severe \n 30 \n 4d6 Con drain \n 2d6 Str damage/day Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide \u00a9 2014, Paizo Inc.; Authors: James Jacobs and Russ Taylor. Initial Effect:  Radiation initially deals Constitution drain unless the exposed character succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. A new saving throw must be attempted to resist radiation's initial damage each round a victim remains exposed to it. Secondary Effect:  Secondary effects from radiation deal Strength damage at a much slower rate than most poisons. This secondary effect ends only after a character succeeds at two consecutive Fortitude saving throws to resist secondary radiation damage. If a character has Strength damage equal to his current Strength score, further damage dealt a secondary effect is instead Constitution damage. Removing Radiation Effects:  All radiation damage is a poison effect, and as such it can be removed with any effect that neutralizes poison. Ability damage and drain caused by radiation damage can be healed normally."

When you use Admixture in conjunction with the Blast Salvo blast shape, you may cause some of the surges to use one blast type used in the Admixture while other surges use the other blast type. For example, a character who uses Admixture with Fire Blast and Numbing Blast talents could fire one surge that deals fire damage and causes a target to catch on fire as well as a second surge that deals cold damage and causes the target to take a penalty on Fortitude saves. This talent may be used in conjunction with Admixture feats, in which case any surge which applies the effect of a sphere besides the Destruction sphere may either deal bludgeoning damage as a basic destructive blast with no blast type or deal no damage but count as a surge of 1 die (chosen when the surge is fired).

Your destructive blast ignores the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.

The channeled energy does its normal number of damage dice of a die size and damage type corresponding to the chosen blast type. Additional effects apply as usual for the chosen blast type. If more than one blast type is known, a different blast type may be selected each time channel energy is used. For example, a 5th level soul weaver with this feat and the Crystal Blast talent could channel energy, dealing 3d4 piercing damage as well as the effects of Crystal Blast in the normal area and with the normal DC of her channel energy. If, for example, she also possesses the Searing Blast talent, the next round she can channel energy, dealing 3d8 fire damage. If the (blast type) talent chosen has additional spell point costs, an additional use of channel energy must be used in place of each spell point required.

The caster level of the destructive blast increases by 1 and an additional +1 for every 4 caster levels of the Repair effect. By spending a spell point, you may instead activate this ability as an immediate action. Additionally, you may pay a spell point and increase the casting time of your fire or electric destructive blasts by 1 step in order to attempt to strengthen your own destructive blasts following the same method.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere (Fire Blast (blast type, fire)), Nature sphere ((fire) package), caster level 3rd. Benefit:  When a creature is set on fire by your fire blast, the fire does not deal 1d6 damage the following round, but rather deals damage equal to the largest fire you may affect. This fire reverts to normal after the first round, dealing 1d6 fire damage on subsequent rounds until extinguished, but you may choose to concentrate each round, or spend a spell point once as a free action, to cause the fire to stay at its increased size until extinguished.

Benefit:  You gain the ability to alter or create objects with highly explosive properties. As part of altering or creating an object, you may spend a spell point to cause any object you alter or create to explode either when it hits a target for the first time (if used to make an attack), when it takes damage for the first time, or when the spell effect ends. This explosion deals damage as your destructive blast with the Explosive Orb shape, and you may treat it as a normal Explosive Orb for any effects, talents or feats interacting with destructive blasts. You may choose whether or not the altered or created object takes damage from the Explosive Orb. The object remains fissile for as long as the alter or create effect lasts. You may only have one fissile creation active at a time, plus an additional fissile creation for every 10 caster levels you possess. If you exceed the limit, \none fissile creation of your choosing ends immediately. If two fissile creations explode during the same round, creatures in the overlapped area suffer diminished results from every fissile creation after the first one, dealing only 1d6 additional damage, +1d6 per 5 caster levels for each overlapping creation."

The wall now grants concealment from creatures on the other side and any non-magical ammunition passing through the wall are destroyed and other non-magical projectiles suffer a -2 penalty to their attack roll. At caster level 9th the wall can also affect ammunition with a +1 enhancement bonus, increasing by +1 for every 3 caster levels thereafter. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability. Special:  If you possess the Demolition talent or apply a (blast type) talent that ignores hardness and deals full damage to objects, such as Shattering Blast or Disintegrate, treat the wall's caster level as 3 higher for determining the effects of this feat."

    "primal blast (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere (any (blast type) talent), Nature sphere (any package). Benefit: When using a (blast type) talent from a blast type category corresponding to a geomancing talent you possess, you may add your casting ability modifier to any attack rolls and damage rolls of the destructive blast. If you do so, you do not modify attack rolls and damage rolls with your destructive blasts with your Strength modifier, Dexterity modifier, or any other ability score (if you have an ability that allows you to modify attack rolls and/or damage rolls with that ability score). On any individual attacks of which a destructive blast is being applied to a natural or weapon attack (such as with the Energy Strike talent or similar ability), Primal Blast instead modifies the attack and damage rolls of the natural or weapon attack (replacing any other ability modifier bonuses with your casting ability modifier as normal). Geomancing Package \n Blast Type Category \n \n \n (Air) package \n Air, electric, sonic \n \n \n (Earth) package \n Crystal, stone \n \n \n (Fire) package \n Fire, light \n \n \n (Metal) package \n Acid, electric \n \n \n (Plant) package \n Acid, force \n \n \n (Water) package \n Cold, crystal Author's Note:  When using the Primal Blast feat, you do not substitute an ability score's bonus damage (e.g. Strength, Dexterity) for your casting ability modifier, you instead do not gain your normal ability score as bonus damage and separately add your casting modifier. Effectively, the attack does not add the ability score and adds your casting modifier as a separate damage bonus. This differs from an unchained rogue's finesse training feature, which replaces Strength with Dexterity and then calculates normally. For example, when using the Destruction sphere Energy Strike talent with a 2 handed weapon, you would only receive your casting ability modifier as bonus damage and not 1.5x your casting ability modifier."

    "stellar evoker [rw hb]": {
      "benefits": "Your magics orbit you creating an orrery of color and power around your person. Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere (Energy Satellite (blast shape)). Benefit:  The maximum number of satellites you may maintain at one time increases by +1. In addition, whenever you could discharge a satellite as an immediate action, you may instead expend an attack of opportunity. You may not target the same creature with a satellite more than once per round. Whenever a destructive blast unaltered by a (blast shape) talent misses its target, you may spend one spell point as an immediate action to form a satellite as though you cast that destructive blast with the Energy Satellite (blast shape). A satellite created this way cannot be discharged the round it is created and lasts for 1 round per caster level, instead of 1 minute per caster level. A destructive blast whose damage was increased by spending an additional spell point does not deal increased damage when reformed into a satellite with this feat. Example:  An evoker spends 1 spell point to cast destructive blast augmented with the Static Blast (blast type). This destructive blast misses its target, so the evoker spends 1 spell point as an immediate action to \"recapture\" this effect as a satellite created with the Energy Satellite (blast shape) with the same (blast type)."

    "supernatural elements (dual sphere) [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "The diverse powers of nature are yours to distort. Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere, Nature sphere. Benefit:  Whenever you create a geomancing or spirit effect, you may change its damage type to a damage type corresponding to a (blast type) talent you possess. Changing the damage type to one other than acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing costs +1 spell point. If you possess the Admixture talent, you may pay the additional costs of Admixture as normal to apply multiple damage types to the geomancing effect or alter only half of the damage of the effect (with the other half retaining the original damage type of the geomancing effect). This does not allow you to apply effects besides damage from any effect used in the blast type or admixture (for example, you may not apply the saving throw penalties from Numbing Blast or an alter time ability from Time-Thief's Admixture to a pummel attack). Effects created with this feat operate as they normally would in spite of their altered damage type. For example, fire that deals acid or cold damage could still be smothered or doused with water to put it out."

    "tether adept (combat)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere (Energy Tether (blast shape)). Benefit:  When using the Energy Tether blast shape, instead of targeting a creature, you can anchor it to a solid surface within its range such as a wall or ceiling (but not floor) as a standard action. This can only work to a maximum range of close, whatever your destructive blast's maximum range. Once the tether is anchored, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the tether's reach (as determined from the anchor point) without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by attempting an Acrobatics check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. If you have a climb speed, you may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or opponents, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the tether's reach). You must have a free hand to use this ability. Blast types that carry a spell point cost do not incur that cost when using this feat. The anchoring object receives no damage nor other effects of your destructive blast."

You must have line of sight and line of effect to the target square unless you possess the Unseeing Teleport talent. You may exclude your destination square from this effect. Admixture Feats Admixture feats grant new ways to utilize the Admixture talent (from the Destruction sphere), adding abilities from other spheres to your destructive blast. All admixture feats replace the second blast talent you would normally apply, with the resulting destructive blast dealing normal blast damage in addition to the effect outlined in the feat. Any additional costs incurred by the additional effect must be paid as normal. If your caster level is different for the two spheres, the destructive blast is governed by your caster level for the relevant blast type and the additional effect is governed by your caster level for the appropriate ability. Author's Note:  When using an (admixture) feat, the resulting sphere effect is not one simultaneous effect, but rather a destructive blast with another sphere effect as a new, independent rider. The new sphere effect is still subject to spell resistance if the destructive blast would not be, and the target makes a new, separate saving throw against the new effect."

If a combination that has not been published is desired, players and gamemasters are encouraged to invent new abilities appropriate to the needs of the character. A blast type talent has four components: 1. Damage Type:  What form does the damage take? This is key for determining what resistances impact the total damage. DR/slashing is useless against fire, while a fire elemental will take full damage against a shrapnel blast. So far, acid, cold, electric, fire, force, negative energy, nonlethal, physical (blunt/piercing/ slashing), sonic and untyped damages have been used. Types uncommonly resisted are more valuable than commonly resisted types like fire or cold. Sonic and force damage are almost never resisted, making them prime choices from an optimization perspective, a benefit that must be considered when balancing the final talent. \n 2. Additional Effect:  Not all status effects are created equal. Dazzled is fairly trivial and thus could be applied for multiple rounds without a save, while paralyzed can lead to immediate death by coup de grace. Stone Blast bypasses spell resistance, which, combined with its ability to bypass weapon type-based DR, accounts for its lack of additional effects. The duration of these effects and the presence or absence of a saving throw is critical in balancing your new talent. Permanent effects are solely the province of advanced talents. \n 3. Die Size:  What dice do you roll to determine the blast's damage? Largely used as a balancing factor, such as Crystal Blast, which inflicts a fairly long duration of a reasonably powerful condition, entangled, as well as creating difficult terrain, useful for controlling the battlefield, has its damage reduced to d4, yet remains one of the most useful blast types. For contrast, Searing Blast deals a commonly resisted damage type, fire, and has no additional effects, thus has its damage die increased to d8. The average damage is the same as with Acid Blast , but the lack of the delay on part of the damage is desirable, somewhat offsetting the less desirable damage type. \n 4. Spell Point Cost:  Do you need to pay additional spell points to use it? As force damage is rarely resisted and useful for its ability to damage incorporeal creatures, Force Blast, which also carries the additional effect of knocking foes prone on a failed save, costs an additional spell point to use. A blast that deals bludgeoning damage with the same die size and additional effect would not have to carry this additional SP cost. For example, a player has a ice themed thaumaturge, taking the destruction sphere, as well as the creation sphere and the nature sphere with water geomancing. Now, after a few levels, the player has decided that the thaumaturge's battlefield control needs some improvement, since long adventuring days have made the heavy use of creation undesirable, but doesn't want to break the ice theme. Changing crystal blast to fit with an ice-themed character is simple enough. A single type of physical damage, piercing, is hindered by most types of damage reduction (DR), while cold damage is one of, if not the, most resisted energy damage types, so simply changing the damage type should allow a reasonable power without further adjustment. Alternatives would be reducing the duration to one round and removing the difficult terrain effect, reasonably allowing a return to the default d6 die size. Removing the Reflex save on the entangle effect, however, would require returning the die size to d4 and an additional spell point cost. For increased damage, a similar damage substitution with searing blast could be made, since fire and cold damage suffer from similar frequencies of resistance, or with acid blast, which is less commonly resisted than cold, for lingering damage. The new talents could be described in a reasonably thematic way, such as more intense cold or lingering frostbite respectively. Creating New Blasts Rather than filling a site with repetitive variations of the different possible combinations, a system for creating blast talents is presented below. This system is expressly optional and only to be used with the approval and participation of the GM. Careful attention should be paid to creating new blast types for characters with the focused energy drawback, as the penalty of the drawback is reduced with each additional blast type available. Choose the desired damage type and additional effects, then adjust duration, die size and cost.  Final result should be between 9-11 points.  Spell point cost should not exceed 1 SP unless designing an advanced talent. Effects beyond those listed may require an advanced talent. Responsibility for the final result making sense (entangling flame blasts, cold setting targets on fire) rests solely with the user. Any novel talent must of course be approved by the gamemaster. New blast types can take the place of existing base blast types of similar type (acid, frost, etc.), be added as additional options to the existing groups, or be made into entirely new blast type groups. When making a new blast type groups, it is best to have a minimum of three blast types to populate it, even if this means simply adapting existing blasts to fit the theme by changing their name and tweaking descriptive text. Some effects, especially those that deny standard actions such as nauseated, dazed, or stunned, should always incur a spell point cost.

Damage dealt is calculated as if the destructive blast was its original damage type as well as nonlethal (for example, an acid blast would still be subject to acid resistance), but the resulting damage is added to the target's nonlethal damage total and not subtracted from their hit points. When using a (blast type) talent that already deals nonlethal damage, your destructive blast damage increases by +1 damage per die. Alternately, you may choose to deal no damage at all, only inflicting secondary effects, such as from (blast type) talents, or only expressing minor, controlled effects of the damage type you would normally deal with your destructive blast. For example, you might create a spark with a Fire Blast, drive a nail into wood with the bludgeoning force of a standard destructive blast, or make an indistinct sound with a Thunder Blast.

If a combination that has not been published is desired, players and gamemasters are encouraged to invent new abilities appropriate to the needs of the character. A blast type talent has four components: 1. Damage Type:  What form does the damage take? This is key for determining what resistances impact the total damage. DR/slashing is useless against fire, while a fire elemental will take full damage against a shrapnel blast. So far, acid, cold, electric, fire, force, negative energy, nonlethal, physical (blunt/piercing/ slashing), sonic and untyped damages have been used. Types uncommonly resisted are more valuable than commonly resisted types like fire or cold. Sonic and force damage are almost never resisted, making them prime choices from an optimization perspective, a benefit that must be considered when balancing the final talent. \n 2. Additional Effect:  Not all status effects are created equal. Dazzled is fairly trivial and thus could be applied for multiple rounds without a save, while paralyzed can lead to immediate death by coup de grace. Stone Blast bypasses spell resistance, which, combined with its ability to bypass weapon type-based DR, accounts for its lack of additional effects. The duration of these effects and the presence or absence of a saving throw is critical in balancing your new talent. Permanent effects are solely the province of advanced talents. \n 3. Die Size:  What dice do you roll to determine the blast's damage? Largely used as a balancing factor, such as Crystal Blast, which inflicts a fairly long duration of a reasonably powerful condition, entangled, as well as creating difficult terrain, useful for controlling the battlefield, has its damage reduced to d4, yet remains one of the most useful blast types. For contrast, Searing Blast deals a commonly resisted damage type, fire, and has no additional effects, thus has its damage die increased to d8. The average damage is the same as with Acid Blast , but the lack of the delay on part of the damage is desirable, somewhat offsetting the less desirable damage type. \n 4. Spell Point Cost:  Do you need to pay additional spell points to use it? As force damage is rarely resisted and useful for its ability to damage incorporeal creatures, Force Blast, which also carries the additional effect of knocking foes prone on a failed save, costs an additional spell point to use. A blast that deals bludgeoning damage with the same die size and additional effect would not have to carry this additional SP cost. For example, a player has a ice themed thaumaturge, taking the destruction sphere, as well as the creation sphere and the nature sphere with water geomancing. Now, after a few levels, the player has decided that the thaumaturge's battlefield control needs some improvement, since long adventuring days have made the heavy use of creation undesirable, but doesn't want to break the ice theme. Changing crystal blast to fit with an ice-themed character is simple enough. A single type of physical damage, piercing, is hindered by most types of damage reduction (DR), while cold damage is one of, if not the, most resisted energy damage types, so simply changing the damage type should allow a reasonable power without further adjustment. Alternatives would be reducing the duration to one round and removing the difficult terrain effect, reasonably allowing a return to the default d6 die size. Removing the Reflex save on the entangle effect, however, would require returning the die size to d4 and an additional spell point cost. For increased damage, a similar damage substitution with searing blast could be made, since fire and cold damage suffer from similar frequencies of resistance, or with acid blast, which is less commonly resisted than cold, for lingering damage. The new talents could be described in a reasonably thematic way, such as more intense cold or lingering frostbite respectively. Creating New Blasts Rather than filling a site with repetitive variations of the different possible combinations, a system for creating blast talents is presented below. This system is expressly optional and only to be used with the approval and participation of the GM. Careful attention should be paid to creating new blast types for characters with the focused energy drawback, as the penalty of the drawback is reduced with each additional blast type available. Choose the desired damage type and additional effects, then adjust duration, die size and cost.  Final result should be between 9-11 points.  Spell point cost should not exceed 1 SP unless designing an advanced talent. Effects beyond those listed may require an advanced talent. Responsibility for the final result making sense (entangling flame blasts, cold setting targets on fire) rests solely with the user. Any novel talent must of course be approved by the gamemaster. New blast types can take the place of existing base blast types of similar type (acid, frost, etc.), be added as additional options to the existing groups, or be made into entirely new blast type groups. When making a new blast type groups, it is best to have a minimum of three blast types to populate it, even if this means simply adapting existing blasts to fit the theme by changing their name and tweaking descriptive text. Some effects, especially those that deny standard actions such as nauseated, dazed, or stunned, should always incur a spell point cost.

When you create a sensor, you may choose to either divine for creatures, detecting any creature which enters the sensor's range, or divine with a (divine) effect which locates information in an area (such as the base Divination sphere effect, the Divine Undead alternate divination, or the Detect Spellcaster talent, but not the Ultravision alternate divination or the Augury talent). The sensor constantly divines the area for the chosen information as though you were divining, and the sensor's ability to divine is modified by any effects that alter your divine ability (such as the Limited Penetration or Shaped Divination drawbacks would affect the alarm's ability to penetrate materials or require you to choose a direction in a cone or line when creating the alarm). The sensor does not pinpoint or reveal the location of something it divines, but otherwise reveals the presence, number, and power of each detected piece of chosen information (such as revealing the presence, number, and power of all fey with Detect Faetouched, but not their location). Optionally, when creating a sensor, you may choose to set any combination of an audible alarm, a mental alarm, or a password. An audible alarm produces a gentle sound, centered on the sensor's location, whenever the sensor detects something, such as a chime or bell. This sound can be heard within the sensor's range, but can be muffled by walls and doors, reducing the range of the sound by 10 feet for each interposing door or wall. Silence effects can muffle this sound. \n A mental alarm alerts you with a mental \"ping\" whenever the sensor detects something and you are within 1 mile of the sensor. This ping can awaken you from sleep, but otherwise does not disturb concentration. Silence effects cannot muffle this ping. \n A password is a phrase chosen when creating a sensor with this talent. Any creature who speaks the password out loud when entering the sensor's range is not detected by the sensor."

The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results: Weal (if the action will probably bring good results). \n Woe (for bad results). \n Weal and woe (for both). \n Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results). If the check fails, you get the \"nothing\" result. A caster who gets the \"nothing\" result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future up to one hour per caster level, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person, in the same day about the same topic, use the same die result as the first casting."

Targeted individuals who only have extraordinary and supernatural abilities show up as having no spellcasting aura, whereas those who have sphere casting, spells, or spell-like abilities show an aura depending on the highest effective spell level of an ability they can use. As always, treat a spherecaster's caster level divided by 2 as their effective spell level. You may spend an additional spell point to upgrade this ability to learn additional information about those within range such as type of spellcasting such as arcane, divine, psychic, etc. (creatures with innate spellcasting, such a dragons show up as racial spellcasting). If the target includes spherecasters with named casting traditions (i.e. Divine Petitioner, Druidic, or Traditional Magic), you gain that knowledge as well. Multiclass core spellcasting classes only reveal as the highest aura between the two. Spherecasters with varying caster levels depending on spheres show auras according to their current highest sphere casting ability.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Divination sphere, caster level 1st. Like alternate divinations, this advanced talent grants additional divinations depending upon what other spheres you know. Unlike alternate divinations, however, this advanced talent grants new sense abilities instead of divine abilities. Creation: Material Sense:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain material sense, automatically detecting the presence of a single material you could create or alter within close range as if you could see it (the material is chosen when you cast this sense). A character can use material sense to distinguish color or visual contrast so long as the distinct components are perceptible if one can only see the specific materials sensed (for example, a character who selects ink with material sense could read documents written in ink but could not see goldfoil illuminations). However, the character is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character can detect creatures who have the material as part of their body but does need line of effect to detect objects made of the material. Material Sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent. Dark: See in Darkness:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain the see in darkness ability. The creature can see perfectly in all darkness, including magical darkness that otherwise might obstruct darkvision. Death: Spirit Sense:  You may spend a spell point to gain the spirit sense ability, which allows you to know when immortal or deathless beings are nearby. You automatically sense the presence of undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures within close range, as if you could see them. A character cannot use spirit sense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive noncreature nonliving material using spirit sense but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Spirit sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent. Life: Lifesense:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain lifesense, automatically detecting the life force of beings within close range as if you could see them. A character cannot use lifesense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material or nonliving creatures (such as constructs or undead) using lifesense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Lifesense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent. Mind: Thoughtsense:  You may spend a spell point to gain the thoughtsense ability. You automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within close range who you could target with your Mind sphere abilities as if you could see them. If you spend an additional spell point, you may detect and locate all types of conscious creatures, not just those that you could affect with mind-affecting effects. Nondetection, Unplottable, and similar effects block thoughtsense. Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and nonsentient (Intelligence 1\u20132) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects. Creatures lacking an Intelligence score, or with a score less than 1, cannot be detected or located with thoughtsense unless you have selected that creature's type with the Recondite Stimuli talent. A character cannot use thoughtsense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material using thoughtsense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Thoughtsense can be foiled by illusions with the Implausible Deniability feat. Telekinesis: Touchsight:  You may spend 2 spell points to gain the touchsight ability. You gain the ability to \"feel\" your surroundings even when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your touchsight field emanates from you out to close range. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though you must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You automatically detect and pinpoint all creatures within close range as if you could see them. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with touchsight is enough to tell you the difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures. A character cannot use touchsight to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. Touchsight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusionary Touch talent. Weather: Storm Vision:  You may spend a spell point to gain a special sense granting the ability to negate any concealment, miss chance, and penalties to Perception directly caused by weather such as rain or fog (be they magical or natural)."

These additional options are noted as expanded options. If you possess the Divination sphere Greater Divine talent, the range of the sphere effects granted by this advanced talent increase by 1 step (1 mile to 10 miles per caster level, 10 miles to 100 miles per caster level). Divine Chart You may spend 2 spell points to divine a location within 1 mile per caster level, granting you vision of the specified location in up to a 1,000-foot radius as though viewed with a map. You gain accurate knowledge of the terrain and topography, including buildings and other structures, although fine topographical features or concealed or hidden locations are not revealed. In addition, all normally visible creatures are located, but no identifying characteristics of those creatures are known, appearing as an indistinct speck. This effect does not reveal invisible or incorporeal creatures or give any information about the interiors of locations (such as buildings or caves). Only information as viewed from above is made known to the caster. Expanded Options: If you possess the Divine Allegiance alternate divination, obvious war camps and contingents of troops are also made known to the caster with a symbol of their banner (if they openly carry such a symbol). \n If you possess the Divine Illusions or Divine Force alternate divinations, the locations of invisible or incorporeal creatures are located respectively, as though detecting a normal creature. \n If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, the locations of extraplanar gates, teleportation circles, and other permanent magical teleportation effects are made known to the caster (although where they connect to is not revealed). This sphere effect is instantaneous and does not adjust for changes that occur after this effect is cast. When casting this sphere effect, a blank piece of parchment or other reasonably flat surface may be used as an optional focus component, the divined information is scribed as a readable map. Alternatively, a sufficiently large table with a malleable substance (such as clay or sand) or bowl of water or other liquid may be used to instead create a still model of the divined area, which crumbles if the table or bowl is disturbed. Lay of the Land You may spend 2 spell points to divine the surrounding lands within up to 10 miles per caster level, extending underground and through objects without hindrance (unless you possess the Divination sphere Limited Penetration sphere-specific drawback). You instantly learn 2 facts + 1 fact per 4 caster levels about any of the following information pertaining to the surrounding lands: terrain, plantlife, minerals, bodies of water, people and civilizations, animal populations, the presence of powerful and unnatural creatures, supernatural phenomenon and landmarks (such as ley lines, fairy rings, extraplanar portals, etc.), or even the general state of the natural area. Expanded Options: If you possess the Divine Elements alternate divination, you may learn 1 additional fact about any element you could divine information for (such as air or water quality, active fires, etc.). \n If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, when you learn a fact about a nearby supernatural phenomenon, if that supernatural phenomenon is connected to another location by a permanent teleportation effect, you learn the type of plane or location it connects to (such as geographical traits, if the same plane, or planar traits if extraplanar). \n If you possess the Divine Weather alternate divination, you may learn 1 additional fact about the weather in the area, including past weather patterns or an accurate forecast of the natural weather for the next day per caster level. This fact is only accurate to naturally occurring weather, not any magical occurrences which could change the weather. This sphere effect provides facts and information which can pertain to any relevant information about the surrounding lands, subject to GM discretion, but should generally be limited to the topography, natural features, and overall qualities about such information (such as total population numbers, locations of major natural bodies, categories of and presence of plant life or minerals, including rare resources, general locations of animals or unnatural creatures, etc.). This sphere effect does not provide precise information about the nature of communities, signs of civilization, or constructed locations, but may reveal their general locations (such as knowing there is something man-made and constructed located inside a mountain, but not being aware of the nature of the construction, such as being a dungeon, shrine, or tower). Pathfinder You may spend 2 spell points to divine the shortest, most direct physical route to a prominent and specific destination, such as a castle, city, lake, crypt, or dungeon. The destination can be outdoors or underground as long as it is prominent. If no specific destination is named (such as \"a nearby lake\" or \"the nearest city\", instead of \"Fort Lotheed\"), this sphere effect locates the nearest destination which meets the description (subject to GM discretion). This sphere effect has no maximum range, but is limited to a destination on the same plane as the caster. This sphere effect is blocked by effects which protect against scrying and other forms of divination (such as not locating a dungeon which is warded against divination effects). Expanded Options: If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, you may designate an extraplanar gate, teleportation circle, and other permanent magical teleportation effect leading to a specific plane as your destination. If no such effect exists, this ability fails and grants no directions. For 1 day per caster level, the caster gains knowledge of the destination's general location and the destination's distance and direction from the caster. In addition, the caster gains a supernatural sense for any actions which must be taken to reach that destination (such as which corridor in a cavern to take). This sphere effect otherwise functions as the find the path spell for the purposes of interactions with the maze spell. Pathfinder Example:  The caster could not specify a specific cabin or home, but could specify the specific logging camp where the structure is located (such as \"The Maple Forest Logging Camp\"). Subject to GM discretion, sufficiently prominent individual buildings (such as landmarks or a noble's mansion) may qualify as a prominent destination if it is notable or unique to the location."

To find a creature, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once. Discern Location has no maximum range and circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or other means of nondetection. Indeed, nothing short of a mind blank spell, the Unplottable advanced Protection talent, or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of the targeted individual or object. You learn the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies."

    "divine identity (divine)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Divination sphere (Discern Individual (sense)), caster level 1st. You may divine the presence of individual auras. When divining in a location, you sense which creatures have recently been in that area. This does not reveal any information about those creatures other than the strength of their aura, but each aura possesses a unique signature; if you sense the same creature more than once, you can easily connect that they are the same creature. Table: Divine Identity Hit Dice \n Aura Strength \n Aura Duration \n \n \n 1-4 \n Dim \n 1 round \n \n \n 5-8 \n Faint \n 1d6 rounds \n \n \n 9-12 \n Moderate \n 1d6 minutes \n \n \n 13-16 \n Strong \n 1d6x10 minutes \n \n \n 17+ \n Overwhelming \n 1d6 days It is also possible for someone to adopt an alias, as the same aura is detected multiple places, but may be more difficult to identify as the same person. If you possess a secret identity, such as with the vigilante class or in another way with GM approval, your secret identity and primary identity will detect as different people. Vigilantes, Fugitives, and Divine Identity:  While it is very easy to identify lower level creatures individually, their auras do not last very long, which is why many petty thieves can go undetected, even in settlements that have access to this ability. However, thieves of great skill or renown can quickly become easy to spot, becoming celebrities in their own right as their deeds are easily identified, even if they themselves are difficult to capture."

Delving in this manner is not an exact practice, and the only answers you may receive are 'yes', 'no', 'unclear', or 'unknown'. You have a 50% chance + 1% per caster level of gaining a true answer. A failed roll produces an 'unknown' answer, while a roll of 90% or higher produces a lie. If you use this ability to ask the same question twice, the same answer repeats. Note:  GMs are fully encouraged to use their own numbers and methods for determining when true, untrue, or unknown answers are gained. A caster divining knowledge could be asking friendly gods, bargaining with the Fates, reading the tablets of life, or using any number of alternate methods for gaining knowledge. As such, the specifics of this ability can vary widely between campaigns\u2014friendly gods may always answer truthfully, while Fates may require specific bargains to be made in exchange for knowledge. It is always possible that the source of information being asked simply does not know the answers to certain questions."

The duration of the Prying Sight talent increases from 1 hour per caster level to 1 day per caster level and you may concentrate on a target under the effects of prying sight no matter how far away they are, as long as they are on the same plane as you. While concentrating as a move action on a target under the effects of prying sight, you may target another creature within close range of the target as a free action and transfer this sphere effect to the creature, treating that creature as the new target of this effect. The duration of this effect is shared between targets, and successfully transferring this effect to a new target ends this effect on the previous target. An unwilling target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect, and a creature who succeeds at their saving throw cannot be targeted in this way again for 24 hours. Unlike other sphere effects, an unwilling target is not made aware when they succeed at a saving throw against this effect. If you spend two additional spell points when casting prying sight, you no longer transfer the effects of prying sight to a new target, and instead copy the effect onto the new target, treating both targets as being under the effects of the same prying sight. There is no limit to the number of creatures you may copy the effects of prying sight onto, but the duration of the effect is still shared between targets, and ends for all affected targets when the effect's duration expires. However, copying prying sight onto new targets treats each copy as a separate sphere effect. If a copy of prying sight ends early or is dispelled for one target, it does not end for all affected targets."

If you choose sight, you see through normal and magical darkness, notice secret doors hidden by magic, see the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, see invisible creatures or objects normally, see through illusions, and see the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, you can focus your vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). If you choose sound, you can hear through soundless environments and magical silence, hear the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, hear creatures or objects rendered inaudible by illusions, and automatically discern when a sound is illusory. If you choose touch or taste/odor (the latter two being a single sense), you discern when such sensations are illusory and can sense through such illusions. The range of true perception conferred is 120 feet. This ability does not grant the ability to perceive through solid objects and does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True Perception does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means.

      "benefits": "If you possess the Weather sphere, you may divine the weather at your location for the next 24 hours, providing you with advance warning of storms, tornadoes, and so on. This reveals only the weather that would arise naturally and does not take into account any magical occurrences that might change the weather. Some talents are marked (divine). These talents give you additional things you may divine for other than magical auras. Only one such talent can be applied to an individual use of divine. Additional Rules No action:  While the divine ability specifies no other action can be taken, this applies specifically to full-round actions, standard actions, move actions, swift actions, and immediate actions. Free actions are still usable. Emanation:  The divine ability is an emanation, meaning the divination will gather information on targets within the area at the completion of casting, as well as targets who enter the area while the effect is still active. Overwhelming Auras:  Whenever an individual divines or senses an aura whose strength is overwhelming, from a source whose HD or CL is equal to or greater than the caster's character level + 10, that individual become stunned for 1 round.

Furthermore, once you have read a magical inscription through this ability, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing even without this sense. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. You can identify glyphs, runes, and symbol spells with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + 1/2 caster level). Some talents are marked (sense).

Both the caster and creatures under the effect of Sensory Overload cannot take any actions, not even walking, and are considered flat-footed. When first casting Sensory Overload and at the end of each round that you continue to concentrate on the effect, the targeted creature takes your caster level in nonlethal damage (fort save negates), and may attempt to end Sensory Overload with a Will save.

You become aware of any attempt to scry on you, such as with a divination (scrying) school spell or the scrying advanced divination talent. If these spells and effects originate within your sense's area, you immediately know their location. Otherwise, if you match or exceed the other caster in an opposed magic skill check, you gain a visual image of the diviner and know their direction and distance from you.

An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion.

These bonuses increase by +10 and +2, respectively, per 5 caster levels. When decreasing a target's movement, you halve all of the target's movement speeds (minimum 5 feet).

    "animate object (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to enhance an object, bestowing movement and a semblance of life. The object obeys your command and understands your language, but as it is not intelligent, it can only obey simple commands such as 'move', 'fight', 'guard', 'stop', etc. If you animate an enemy's weapon, the weapon cannot move and attack while it is being held, but the wielder must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster level + casting ability modifier) each round they hold the item or lose their action fighting their weapon for control. If you animate an enemy's armor or clothing, the enemy becomes entangled and must succeed at a Reflex save each round or be staggered for that round. Animated objects are constructs, and gain Hit Dice according to their size. The maximum sized object you may animate depends on your caster level, according to Table: Animate Object. You can only have a number of animated object Hit Dice at once equal to twice your caster level.

However, these are not options the player has the power to choose; an animated object's construction qualities and flaws are instead chosen by the GM to reflect the item in question. For example, animating an object made from cloth grants it the 'cloth' construction flaw, while animating a slingshot would create an animated object with the ranged attack construction quality."
    },
    "bestow intelligence (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to enhance an animal, plant, object, or mindless creature, granting it temporary intelligence. The target becomes a magical creature (or intelligent item if an object), and gains an Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom score of 6 + 1/2 your caster level (or its original score, whichever is higher), as well as an alignment equal to your own, and the ability to speak and understand one language of your choice which you also speak and understand, +1 language you know per point of Intelligence bonus. It also gains normal senses to 60 feet if it did not previously possess any. However, temporary minds do not grant skill points or feats, nor the ability to move. However, a target with a bestowed mind no longer counts as mindless for purposes such as immunities. For the most part, the new mind has a beginning disposition of friendly towards you, unless the creature already had a different disposition (for example, a hostile creature would still be hostile). The target does not gain greater insight into its surroundings before it gained intelligence (thus, an intelligent rock could not tell you who passed by it before it gained sentience, nor an intelligent tree describe a creature who climbed it the day before), nor does it automatically obey your commands, although it will usually provide favors and aid that is not too dangerous. Mindless creatures must attempt a Will saving throw against this effect unless it is a creature already under your control, such as an animated object or undead minion. When bestowing a mind onto a creature under your control, it still continues to obey you explicitly even though it is now intelligent."

    },
    "emphasize belief (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may enhance creatures, granting them alignment subtypes corresponding to the non-Neutral components of their alignment. While under the effects of this enhancement, that creature gains DR equal to one-third of your caster level (minimum 1), bypassed by attacks made with weapons aligned to the alignment opposed to their new subtype. This damage reduction stacks with any other source of damage reduction they might have."
    },
    "energize body (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may enhance a target's physical resilience. This suppresses the fatigued condition or reduces the exhausted condition to fatigued for the duration. You may spend a spell point to instead completely suppress the exhausted condition for the duration. The target is still considered to be suffering those conditions for the purposes of effects that would render them fatigued or exhausted. If the target is sleeping, this enhancement causes them to immediately wake up. Additionally, the target adds your caster level to their Constitution score for the purpose of how long it may hold its breath or run before attempting Constitution checks. The target also doubles their carrying capacity. This multiplier increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels possessed (thus becoming x3 at 5th caster level, x4 at 10th caster level, etc.)."
    },
    "energy enhancement (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may enhance a weapon, granting it the corrosive, flaming, frost, or shock weapon special abilities. The weapons deal an extra point of elemental damage for every 2 caster levels possessed. You may also apply this enhancement to a consumable item, a splash weapon, or a dose of poison. Targets who consume the item, suffer direct or splash damage from the splash weapon, or are struck with the poison (whether or not they fail their saving throw) also suffer acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (chosen at the time the enhancement is created) equal to your caster level."

    "enhance focus (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may enhance creatures, allowing them a higher standard of consistency. Whenever the creature takes 10 on a skill check, they may treat the die as if it had rolled 10 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 11, to a maximum of 20 at 20th caster level) instead."
    },
    "harden/weaken (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may enhance an object to either increase or decrease its hardness, or enhance a creature to grant it or lessen its damage reduction. You may increase or decrease an object's hardness by an amount equal to your caster level (minimum 1). Decreasing an object's hardness gives it the fragile quality if it does not already have it. When targeting a creature, you may either grant it DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1), or decrease its current damage reduction by the same amount. This only affects damage reduction that can be bypassed (so it could decrease DR/cold iron, but not DR/-)."
    },
    "improved flexibility (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may enhance a creature, allowing it to make Escape Artist checks that normally require a full minute to perform as a full-round action. At 6th caster level, it ignores all penalties while squeezing through narrow spaces, and may move through such spaces at full speed. At 12th caster level, it may squeeze through tight spaces at its full speed, and does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC when doing so. At 18th level, it may use Escape Artist to squeeze through any space large enough to fit one of its fists."
    },
    "lighten (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to enhance an item or creature, reducing its weight or even making it weightless. The maximum sized object you can affect is given on Table: Lighten Object. An enhanced object weighs half as much as normal, but if you choose, you may make objects up to one size category smaller than your limit completely weightless, or up to 2 size categories smaller float up or down as you choose at a rate of 20 feet per round. While you cannot make an object or creature move any direction other than up or down, this can easily be combined with telekinesis, wind power, or pushing off a wall (at half the target's usual speed) to create flight-like effects. Unwilling creatures are allowed a new saving throw each round to negate this effect, but they may suffer falling damage if successful. When determining things such as penalties for using oversized weapons, damage dealt from dropping an object like an indirect siege engine, affecting an object with telekinesis, etc., a 1/2 weight object counts as being one size category smaller and a weightless object counts as being two size categories smaller. 1/2-weight creatures suffer a -2 penalty to their CMD vs. bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers, and 1/2-weight armor has its spell failure chance decreased by 5%, its max Dexterity bonus increased by 1, and its armor check penalty decreased by 1 (minimum 0). Weightless or floating creatures/armor double these bonuses/penalties. Additionally, a levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1. Creatures floating above the ground cannot use a land speed to move without a wall or some other method of pushing themselves horizontally.

The maximum sized object you can affect this way is given on Table: Spectral Enhancement. Alternatively, you may enhance a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or as many as 50 pieces of ammunition grouped together, granting it either the ghost touch special weapon ability or ghost touch special armor ability. If you spend an additional spell point, the enhanced equipment gains an additional benefit: If the enhanced equipment gains the ghost touch special weapon ability, the weapon becomes especially potent against undead and incorporeal creatures. Undead or incorporeal creatures damaged by the weapon must succeed at a Will saving throw or be sickened for 1 round, bypassing any immunity to the sickened condition the target may possess.

This cannot be used to rob a target of its base land speed, nor of its only movement speed (for example, robbing an air elemental of its fly speed)."

    },
    "bestow life": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere (Animate Object (enhance), Bestow Intelligence (enhance)), caster level 10th. You may spend 3 spell points and 24 hours to bring a plant, animal, construct, or object to life. This is an instantaneous effect, and as such is a permanent change and cannot be dispelled. This has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher. This ability may manifest in one of the following ways: You transform a tree into an intelligent animated object, granting it the benefits of your Animate Object and Bestow Intelligence enhancements. The target's type changes to magical beast. \n You transform an animal into an awakened animal. The target's type changes to magical beast, and its mental ability scores change to 3d6 each. At the GM's discretion, the animal may be recreated using whatever character creation rules the campaign has employed. \n You grant life to an empty body. This could be a body created through the Fleshcraft and Create Materials Creation advanced talents or a body crafted from parts of other recently slain bodies sewed together. (Assembly requires a minimum of six different bodies\u2014one for each limb, the torso including head, and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required.) The target becomes a living 1st level commoner of whatever race its body was crafted to mimic, but may retrain as usual. \n You transform a magical object into an intelligent item with a 10 Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The item must be a permanent magical item (thus scrolls, wands, potions, etc. cannot be enhanced in this way), and the item does not gain any powers automatically; abilities and attribute bonuses must be crafted into the item as usual. \n You transform a construct into a sentient construct. The target's Intelligence changes to 3d6 and its Charisma increases by 2d6. The target gains one language the caster speaks, plus one additional language that the caster knew per point of the target's Intelligence modifier (if positive). At the GM's discretion, the construct may be recreated using whatever character creation rules the campaign has employed. Creatures and magic items created in this fashion possess your alignment and can speak one language that you know plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any). An animal affected in this manner cannot serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount, but it may serve as a cohort if the caster possesses a means for having one. With the exception of intelligent items (which follow the intelligent item rules), the affected creature serves you as a faithful companion. However, as it is a living, intelligent being, it will expect good treatment in return (indeed, an animal that was treated harshly before it was enhanced in this way may feel no particular loyalty to the caster at all). A caster may only have one companion of this sort at any one time; if a second creature is awakened, the first remains friendly, but no longer undertakes tasks for the caster unless it is in its own best interests."

    "give magic life": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere (Bestow Intelligence (enhance)), caster level 10th. Whenever you use a non-instantaneous sphere ability, you may spend 2 spell points to give it the Embodiment of Magic template instead of casting it normally; if you do so, it is initially friendly towards you, and will die at the end of the effect's duration. If you also possess Bestow Life, you may use it on creatures created through this talent; instead of Bestow Life's normal effects, doing so increases their potency by 3, and prevents them from dying at the end of the effect's duration."

    "inherent enhancement (enhance) [archmagi's hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere (Deep Enhancement, Mental Enhancement, Physical Enhancement), caster level 17th. When you utilize Mental Enhancement or Physical Enhancement to grant a creature a bonus to their ability scores, you can temporarily modify a creature's intrinsic capabilities by spending an additional spell point. The bonus type of the enhancement changes to untyped. However, this reduces the duration of the enhancement to a maximum of 1 round per caster level. The untyped bonus to an ability score stacks with the enhancement bonus provided by another casting of normal Mental Enhancement or Physical Enhancement. Additionally, you may spend one hour and five spell points to enhance a creature's intrinsic qualities. Doing so is expensive, and requires material components worth at least 25,000 gp to perform. At the end of the hour, you may grant your target a +1 inherent bonus to a single ability score. For each additional 25,000 gp in material components spent as part of this ritual, you may increase the bonus by 1, up to a maximum of +5. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous and cannot be dispelled, and do not stack with themselves."

    "referential enhancements": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere (Deep Enhancement, Mass Enhancement [mass]), caster level 15th. Whenever you use Mass Enhancement, you may spend 2 additional spell points to have the enhancement affect a 30-foot burst instead. If you do so, the enhancement's duration changes to days per caster level and it affects all valid targets that are within the enhancement's area; the benefits fade if the target leaves the area, but return if they do. Upon using this talent, you may exclude targets from the effect based on some visible or audible criterion. This would allow you to, for example, have Enhance Equipment affect any swords within the area."
    },
    "reverse gravity (enhance)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere (Lighten (enhance)), caster level 15th. You may spend 2 spell points to enhance an area of up to 1\u00a010-foot cube per caster level, arranged contiguously. Unlike most enhancements, you can only maintain this effect through concentration for up to 1 round per caster level. Spending an additional spell point to allow it to become self-sustaining lasts for 1 round per caster level, not 1 minute per caster level, and is unaffected by Deep Enhancement. Within this area, gravity reverses. Unattached objects and creatures in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the effect ends. At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself and not fall upward. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling. Enhancement Sphere Feats"

You may use Animate Object on portions of objects or structures, such as animating a hallway within a castle or the front door of a cottage. Objects animated in this way always have the Immobile flaw. Additionally, such objects are rigidly attached to the rest of the structure, reducing its reach as if it were two size categories smaller than it actually is. The animated portion of the structure may attack creatures that are within reach of any of its surfaces, and is immune to any effect that would move it that could not also move the structure it is a component of."

Animated Objects For the most part, a player creating an animated object does not get to choose what construction points and flaws it possesses.

Special Abilities Construction Points Animated objects have a number of Construction Points (CP) used to purchase abilities and defenses in addition to those presented above. A Medium-sized animated object has 2 CP; differently sized animated objects have CP totals as detailed on the size chart on this page. If an animated object spends more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Construction points allow an animated object to approximate the object being animated; if a cloth shirt is being animated, it should possess the cloth flaw. If an iron bar is being animated, it should possess the 'metal' option listed below. Additional Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains an additional slam attack. Additional Natural Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains an additional natural attack. The animated object must have an appropriate appendage or part for the natural attack. Additional Movement (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed. Augmented Critical (Ex, 1 CP):  Increase the threat range for the animated object's melee attacks by 1 or the threat multiplier by 1. This cannot combine with itself or with the piercing attack or slashing attack animated object abilities. Armor (Ex; 2 CP):  The animated object is a suit of armor. When worn by another creature, it ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, any damage the wearer takes is dealt to the animated object instead; if the animated object loses all of its hit points, then the armor bonus it grants is reduced to +0. While worn, it grants its armor bonus to AC, as well as the benefits of any special abilities, as normal. As long as the animated object is still animated, it may be donned as a full-round action and removed as a swift action. Burn (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains burn (1d6) with its slam attacks. This can be applied multiple times. Its effects stack. Note:  Most objects that deal elemental damage do so by being on fire (such as a lit torch or candlestick). If an object might deal another type of damage, such as an animated bottle of acid, use the Burn quality and replace the damage type as appropriate. Constrict (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains constrict with its slam attacks (the animated object must have grab before it can take this ability). Durable (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object is exceptionally durable. It gains 5 additional hit points for each size category it has beyond Tiny, to a maximum of 30 additional hit points for Colossal animated objects. This can be applied multiple times, and its effects stack. Exceptional Reach (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains +5 feet of reach with one melee attack. Increase reach on all attacks for an additional +1 CP. Faster (Ex, 1 CP):  One of the animated object's movement modes increases by +10 feet. Fluid (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object is unusually fluid; it may squeeze through tight spaces as if it were two sizes smaller than it actually is. Garrote (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object strangles creatures it grapples - it gains the strangle special attack (the object must have grab before it can select this ability). Grab (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains grab special attack with slam attacks. Graft (Su; 1 CP):  The animated object can serve as a replacement limb for a creature two size categories larger than it. While attached to a creature, the animated object ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, the creature benefiting from the graft ignores any penalties due to missing that limb, and gains one of the animated object's natural attacks. If the animated object possesses any special attacks modifying that natural attack, the beneficiary of the graft gains it as well, using their size in place of that of the animated object. An animated object with graft may be attached to a creature with a DC 20 Heal check. Hollow (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object gains the swallow whole special attack with its slam attacks; creatures swallowed by the animated object do not automatically take damage (the animated object must have grab before it may select this ability). This can be applied multiple times, each time increasing the animated object's size category for the purposes of what creatures and objects it can grab and swallow by one. Improved Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  All the animated object's melee or ranged attacks do damage as though it were one size category larger. A crafter must purchase improved attack separately for melee and ranged attacks. Magic Item (Su; 1 CP):  The animated object is some description of magic item. It may activate itself as if it were holding or wearing itself. Magic weapons may apply their enchantments to one of their natural attacks (for example, an animated +1 dragon bane longsword would have a +1 dragon bane slam attack). Material Properties (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object's natural attacks are considered to be weapons made from the animated object's special material. The animated object must have metal or special material before it may select this ability. Metal (Ex, 2 CP):  The animated object is made of common metal. Its hardness increases to 10, and it gains a +2 increase to its natural armor bonus. Mithral animated objects cost 4 CP, and gain hardness 15 plus a +4 increase to natural armor. Adamantine animated objects cost 6 CP, gain hardness 20, and receive a +6 increase to natural armor. Special Materials (Ex; 1+ CP) The animated object's hardness is equal to the hardness of the Special Material it is made from. In addition, the animated object gains a natural armor bonus equal to the CP cost of this ability. This ability costs 2 CP for every +5 increase to hardness gained from this ability, rounded up. If the special material has a hardness less than 10, it costs 1 CP instead. If the material the animated object is created from has a hardness less than 5, use the Fragile flaw instead. Piercing Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  Replace one melee attack with an attack that does the same amount of piercing damage and has a \u00d73 multiplier. Replace all melee attacks for an additional +1 CP. Animated object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on piercing attacks. Pull (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object gains a pull (5 feet) special attack with slam attacks (the animated object must have grab before it can take this ability). Ranged Attack (Ex, 2 CP):  Replace one slam attack with a ranged attack. It does the same amount of damage, and has a range of 20 feet. Replace all attacks for an additional +2 CP. Animated object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on ranged attacks. Resistance (Ex, 2 CP):  The animated object gains resistance 5 to one type of damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) chosen at the time of the animated object's creation. This effect can be applied multiple times. Its effects do not stack; each time it is applied, it applies to a different type of damage. Slashing Attack (Ex, 1 CP):  Replace one slam attack with an attack that does slashing damage and has either a 19\u201320 threat range (for blade-like attacks) or a \u00d73 threat multiplier (for axe or scythe-like attacks). Replace all melee attacks for an additional +1 CP. Animated object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on slashing attacks. Stone (Ex, 1 CP):  The animated object is made of stone or crystal. Its hardness increases to 8 and it gains a +1 increase to its natural armor bonus. Toxic (Ex; 1 CP):  The animated object is coated with a contact or injury poison. It gains the poison special attack with its slam attacks. The crafter may spend an additional CP to have that poison apply to all of its natural attacks instead. Trample (Ex, 2 CP):  The animated object gains the trample special attack. Trip (Ex, 2 CP)  The animated object gains the trip special ability with one of its slam attacks. Construction Flaws Animated objects can gain more CP by applying flaws, which hamper the animated object but provide additional CP to spend on beneficial abilities. If the CP gained in this way is not spent on beneficial abilities, its CR decreases by 1 for every 2 CP conserved. Aberration (Ex; +2 CP):  The animated object is made from squirmy flesh instead of inorganic substances; change its type to aberration, give it a Constitution score equal to its Strength score, replace construct traits (Ex) with amorphous (Ex) and darkvision 60 feet, and replace its hardness with an equal amount of damage reduction bypassed by magic. It is still mindless. Brittle (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object gains vulnerability to cold. Cloth (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object is made of thick cloth. Its hardness decreases to 0. Clunky (Ex, +1 CP):  Treat the animated object as though it had the staggered special quality. Flammable (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object gains vulnerability fire. Fragile (Ex; +1 CP):  The animated object gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Haunted (Ex, +1 CP):  The animated object is haunted by a malevolent spirit. It takes damage from positive energy as if it were an undead creature and can be detected by detect undead. Immobile (Ex; +2 CP):  The animated object has a base land speed of 0 feet, and may not have abilities or flaws applied which alter its base land speed or grant it new movement speeds. Noncombatant (Ex; +1 CP):  The animated object does not possess a slam natural attack and cannot take hostile actions. If the animated object ever gains an Intelligence score, as a free action at the start of its turn, the animated object can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the caster's Enhancement sphere DC to defy this construction flaw for 1 round. [Gravecaller's HB] Slower (Ex, +1 CP):  One of the animated object's movement modes decreases by \u2013 10 feet. Undead (Ex; +1 CP):  The animated object is made of corpse materials such as flesh or smooth bone; change its type to undead, adjust its Charisma score to be equal to its Strength score, replace construct traits (Ex) with undead immunities (Ex), and replaces its hardness with an equal amount of damage reduction bypassed by bludgeoning damage. It is still mindless. This flaw cannot be applied alongside the aberration flaw.  Special:  If the animated object also possesses the haunted construction flaw, the animated object is stunned for 1 round whenever it fails a saving throw against a positive energy effect. This bypassesses any immunities the animated object may possess. [Gravecaller's HB] Wild Magic"

This is applied after other magic that alters carrying capacity. \n \n \n 54 \n For 1 minute per caster level, bizarre magnetic fields fill the area within close range of the caster. This moves with the caster, and does not affect the caster nor their carried equipment. All unattended metal objects are ejected from this area (as if pushed by a Strength of 14). Targets may hold metal weapons but suffer a -2 penalty to all attacks, and targets in metal armor treat the area as difficult terrain. \n \n \n 55 \n The magnitude of the enhance effect is halved, reducing any bonuses and penalties granted, rounding down, minimum 1. Animated objects have half their normal hit points from this effect. \n \n \n 56 \n The caster is exhausted. \n \n \n 57 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster take a penalty on all physical attribute-based skill checks equal to 1/4 caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 58 \n For 1 round per caster level, all creatures within close range of the caster gain a +1 + 1/5 caster level resistance bonus to all saving throws. \n \n \n 59 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all creatures within close range of the caster gain a 10 ft. enhancement bonus to all movement speeds. This bonus increases by 10 ft. per 10 caster levels. \n \n \n 60 \n For 1d6 rounds, the targets or creatures in the target area have their clothing, gear, and surrounding environment animate, causing the them to be entangled. A Reflex save negates this effect. \n \n \n 61 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all creatures within close range of the caster take a 10 ft. penalty to all movement speeds, to a minimum of 5 feet. This penalty increases by 10 ft. per 10 caster levels. \n \n \n 62 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 63 \n For 1 minute per caster level, no armor or shield worn by an allied creature within medium range of the caster benefits from its enhancement bonus to AC. Hardness and hit points are unaffected. \n \n \n 64 \n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \n \n \n 65 \n All objects within close range of the caster become weightless for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 66 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the target suffers a temporary penalty to Charisma equal to half the effect's caster level. This has no effect on mindless creatures or objects. \n \n \n 67 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all hostile creatures within close range of the caster take a penalty on all mental attribute-based skill checks equal to 1/4 caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 68 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead staggered until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 69 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster take a 10 ft. penalty to all movement speeds.

This has no effect on mindless creatures or objects. \n \n \n 77 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster gain a 10 ft. enhancement bonus to all movement speeds. This bonus increases by 10 ft. per 10 caster levels. \n \n \n 78 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all objects and creatures within close range of the caster are lightened as the Lighten talent. Creatures may succeed on a Will save to negate this effect. \n \n \n 79 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all hostile creatures within close range of the caster take a 10 ft. penalty to all movement speeds. This penalty increases by 10 ft. per 10 caster levels. \n \n \n 80 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 81 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the caster takes a penalty on all physical attribute-based skill checks equal to 1/2 caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 82 \n For 1 minute per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster gain a competence bonus on all physical attribute-based skill checks equal to 1/4 caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 83 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, the caster takes a 10 ft. penalty to all movement speeds.

This bonus increases by 10 ft. per 10 caster levels. \n \n \n 86 \n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 87 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the target gains a temporary enhancement bonus to Intelligence equal to half the effect's caster level. For inanimate targets, treat this as the Bestow Intelligence talent. \n \n \n 88 \n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 89 \n For 1 round per caster level, all weapons wielded by hostile creatures within close range of the caster gain the fragile quality, even if they are magical or masterwork. \n \n \n 90 \n For 1 minute per caster level, the target gains a temporary enhancement bonus to Charisma equal to half the effect's caster level.

This object is neutral toward the caster and attempt to flee any conflict, but otherwise meanders aimlessly. The size affected increases by one category per 5 caster levels. \n \n \n 93 \n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \n \n \n 94 \n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 95 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all appropriate weapons wielded by creatures within close range of the caster gain the keen special ability. \n \n \n 96 \n For 1 round per caster level, all weapons wielded by hostile creatures within close range of the target gain the fragile quality, even if they are magical or masterwork. \n \n \n 97 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all appropriate weapons wielded by allied creatures within close range of the target gain the keen special ability. \n \n \n 98 \n The magnitude of the enhance effect is doubled, doubling any bonuses and penalties granted.

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to enhance an object, bestowing movement and a semblance of life. The object obeys your command and understands your language, but as it is not intelligent, it can only obey simple commands such as 'move', 'fight', 'guard', 'stop', etc. If you animate an enemy's weapon, the weapon cannot move and attack while it is being held, but the wielder must pass a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster level + casting ability modifier) each round they hold the item or lose their action fighting their weapon for control. If you animate an enemy's armor or clothing, the enemy becomes entangled and must pass a Reflex save each round or also be staggered that round. Animated objects are constructs, and gain Hit Dice according to their size. The maximum sized object you may animate depends on your caster level, according to Table: Animate Object.

When worn by another creature, it ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, any damage the wearer takes is dealt to the object instead; if the object loses all of its hit points, then the armor bonus it grants is reduced to +0. While worn, it grants its armor bonus to AC, as well as the benefits of any special qualities, as normal. As long as the object is still animated, it may be donned as a full-round action and removed as a swift action. \n Durable (Ex; 1 CP) \n The object is exceptionally durable. It gains 5 additional hit points for each size category it has beyond Tiny, to a maximum of 30 additional hit points for Colossal animated objects. This can be applied multiple times, and its effects stack. \n Fluid (Ex; 1 CP) \n The animated object is unusually fluid; it may squeeze through tight spaces as if it were two sizes smaller than it actually is. \n Garrote (Ex; 1 CP) \n The object strangles creatures it grapples - it gains the Strangle special attack (the object must have Grab before it can select this ability). \n Graft (Su; 1 CP) \n The object can serve as a replacement limb for a creature two size categories larger than it. While attached to a creature, the object ceases to act as a creature of its own. Instead, the creature benefiting from the graft ignores any penalties due to missing that limb, and gains one of the object's natural attacks. If the object possesses any Special Attacks modifying that natural attack, the beneficiary of the graft gains it as well, using their size in place of that of the object. \n An object with graft may be attached to a creature with a DC 20 Heal check. \n Hollow (Ex; 1 CP) \n The animated object gains the Swallow Whole special attack with its Slam attacks; creatures swallowed by the object do not automatically take damage (the object must have Grab before it may select this ability). This can be applied multiple times, each time increasing the object's size category for the purposes of what creatures and objects it can grab and swallow by one. \n Magic Item (Su; 1 CP) \n The object is some description of magic item. It may activate itself as if it were holding or wearing itself. Magic weapons may apply their enchantments to one of their natural attacks (for example, an animated +1 Dragon-Bane longsword would have a +1 Dragon-Bane slam attack). \n Material Properties (Ex; 1 CP) \n The object's natural attacks are considered to be weapons made from the object's special material. The object must have Metal or Special Material before it may select this ability. \n Toxic (Ex; 1 CP) \n The object is coated with a contact or injury poison. It gains the Poison special attack with its Slam attacks. The crafter may spend an additional CP to have that poison apply to all of its natural attacks instead. \n New Flaws \n Aberration (Ex; +2 CP) \n The object is made from squirmy flesh instead of inorganic substances; change its type to Aberration, give it a Constitution score equal to its Strength score, replace Construct Traits (Ex) with Amorphous (Ex) and Darkvision 60 ft., and replace its Hardness with an equal amount of DR bypassed by magic. It is still Mindless. \n Centralized (Ex; +2 CP) \n The object has weak points, and loses its immunity to critical hits. \n Immobile (Ex; +2 CP) \n The object has a base land speed of 0 ft., and may not have abilities or flaws applied which alter its base land speed or grant it new movement speeds. \n Fragile (Ex; +1 CP) \n The object gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. \n Animating Structural Features \n As it stands, Animate Object abruptly stops scaling at approximately level 10 for anyone who wants to bring the animated object into a dungeon or other enclosed space with them. While there are ways around this problem (such as the Fluid ability, or using Alteration to shrink an animated object down to size), they ultimately cut into some of the fun of making a house smack people. \n With this variant rule, Animate Object can be used on portions of structures, allowing casters to animate a hallway within a castle or the front door of a cottage. Objects animated in this way always have the Immobile flaw. Additionally, such objects are rigidly attached to the rest of the structure, reducing its Reach as if it were two size categories smaller than it actually is. \n In exchange for this limitation, the animated portion of the structure may attack creatures that are within reach of any of its surfaces, and is immune to any effect that would move it that couldn't also move the structure it is a component of. \n Elemental Objects \n Currently, the sole form of energy damage you may add to the slam attacks of an animated object is fire. This makes sense for animated candlesticks, but what about animated flasks of acid or more exotic objects? As such, you may choose to replace the fire damage from the Burn ability with another type of energy damage when animating objects that are potentially dangerous due to some elemental hazard. \n Objects of Exceptional Size \n By default, the maximum size of objects that may be animated is Colossal. However, Drop Dead Studios has used three sizes past Colossal in previous products - namely Colossal+, Colossal++, and Colossal+++. \n This variant expands the higher end of what's possible with animated objects as follows: \n \n \n Caster Level \n Size \n Hit Dice \n Maximum Construction Points \n \n \n 30 \n Colossal+ \n 16d10+100 \n 7 \n \n \n 36 \n Colossal++ \n 19d10+120 \n 8 \n \n \n 42 \n Colossal+++ \n 22d10+150 \n 9 \n \n \n Other Materials \n By default, the only options for an animated object's Metal ability are \"common\" metals, mithral, and adamantine. Similarly, the Stone ability offers a choice of generic stone or crystal. However, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game has introduced a vast number of special materials over the years; therefore, the following ability is introduced to cover any of those materials. \n Special Materials (Ex; 1+ CP) \n The animated object's hardness is equal to the hardness of the Special Material it is made from. In addition, the animated object gains a natural armor bonus equal to the CP cost of this ability. \n This ability costs 2 CP for every +5 increase to hardness gained from this ability, rounded up. If the special material has a hardness less than 10, it costs 1 CP instead. \n If the material the animated object is created from has a hardness less than 5, use the Fragile flaw instead."

    "nature-connection (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Survival, Stealth, and Perception skill checks made within one terrain of your choice (chosen when this fey-blessing is cast). This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. Consult the ranger list of favored terrains to see potential terrain types. You may gain this fey-blessing multiple times, gaining this bonus in a different terrain each time. Magic talents marked as (fey-blessing) grant additional fey-blessings. Some (fey-blessing) talents have the polymorph descriptor. A creature may be under multiple of these fey-blessings at one time if they are from the same source. Rule Notes Alteration Sphere:  Some fey-blessings have the polymorph descriptor. A willing creature under the effects of one of these abilities may still be targeted by the shapeshift ability of the Alteration sphere. Each such fey-blessing maintained during the shapeshift reduces the number of traits that may be assigned as part of the shapeshift by 1. Unthreatening Form functions as a base form and may have traits added to it as if it were blank form. Fey creatures and Fey-Blessings:  Creatures with the fey type are unaffected by the base function of fey-link, but its duration is still needed for determining the length of time fey-blessings remain active. Due to their inherent connection, creatures of the fey type (naturally, not via fey-link) may begin a fey-link on themselves (and only themselves) as a free action. Fey-Blessing with Differing Caster Levels:  Fey-link and the fey-blessings applied to it do not necessarily have to have the same caster level. The duration and any other parameters based on the caster level of the fey-link are determined by the caster level with which it was cast. Likewise, any variable parameters of each individual fey-blessing are determined by the individual casting. Targets with Non-Ability Scores:  Some creature types lack certain ability scores, such as constructs and undead lacking a Constitution score. If such a creature is under the effects of fey-link, any non-ability score is treated as being 10, with the exception of Intelligence, which is treated as being 1. Do not recalculate the creature's hit points, saves, or skills, and do not grant any feats. Note that changing creature type can have a significant effect on type-based immunities; the creature under the fey-link may find itself susceptible to many effects it was previously immune to.

      "benefits": "You summon a flask, gourd, stein, or wineskin filled with fairy liquor, which replenishes itself after each drink. The flask is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the flask is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends immediately. You may determine the quality of the brew with a Craft (alcohol) or Profession (brewer) check made as part of activating this fey blessing, but the result has no impact on its efficacy. You may drink from it as a move action; you may allow a creature whom you are within the natural reach of to drink from it as a standard action on their turn with no action required on your part. This counts as consuming an alcoholic beverage. Choose one of the following effects when the flask is created: Bolstering Brew:  The imbiber gains temporary hit points equal to your caster level that last for 1 minute. As usual, temporary hit points do not stack with others from the same source. Brawling Booze:  The imbiber gains the  Barroom  sphere or a (drunk) talent of your choice from that sphere for 1 minute. Calming Sip:  You may make a magic skill check against any ongoing effects with the emotion descriptor currently affecting the imbiber. If successful, that effect is suppressed for 1 round per caster level. If you spend a spell point as part of the drink (no action required), the effect is instead dispelled. Liquid Courage:  The imbiber gains a +2 (+1 per 7 caster levels) circumstance bonus on saves vs. fear effects for 1 minute. If the flask is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you may summon it into your possession as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You may have multiple instances of this fey-blessing active at one time; select a different effect for each. Creatures that are immune to the effects of alcohol cannot benefit from this effect."

A creature that fails its save cannot move away from you without first succeeding on a Strength check or an Escape Artist check against your sphere DC made as a move action. Grasping Tresses:  You may use your hair to grab objects. Your hair grants a slam attack (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small, bludgeoning damage), but may not assist in wielding weapons, activate magic items, or wield a shield. It may hold items and as a swift action you can use it to draw a sheathed or hidden weapon, ready a shield, retrieve a stored item, load a crossbow, open a door, pick up an unattended item within your natural reach, sheathe or store an item, or take other non-offensive actions involving manipulating objects."

A creature that successfully saves cannot be targeted with your beckoning call for 24 hours. If a creature fails its saving throw, it approaches to sit before you, and follows you if you move, so long as you take a standard action each round to maintain the effect. As normal, fascinated creatures suffer a -4 penalty to Perception, but cease to be fascinated if attacked or approached with an obviously hostile intent, such as someone drawing a weapon. This is a mind-affecting effect."

    "crown of the courts (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You don a crown representing a chosen court, usually seelie or unseelie (though others may be available depending on setting), gaining an aura of authority over the fey. The fey-blessing gains the descriptor matching the chosen court. The crown is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the crown is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends immediately. If the crown is not in your possession at the end of your turn, you lose the benefits of this fey-blessing until it returns to your possession. You can summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight it it. You may only have one crown active at a time; activating this ability again automatically ends any previous instances. Creatures of the fey type that are associated with the chosen court (good and neutral for seelie, evil for unseelie) are incapable of taking hostile action against you without succeeding on a Will save; if successful, they may act as normal and do not need to save again against your use of this effect for 24 hours. On a failure they are incapable of knowingly taking hostile action against you (targeting with an attack or combat maneuver, casting a non-harmless sphere effect, spell, or spelllike or supernatural ability that includes you as a target or within its area of effect, or aiding or granting flanking bonuses to creatures taking hostile action against you) for 1 minute. If you take hostile action against a creature that has failed its save, it is treated as having succeeded on its save. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Creatures of the fey type not associated with the chosen court are shaken whenever they are within 30 ft. of you. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
    },
    "enchanting music (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "As a move action, you may summon one masterwork musical instrument, be it percussion, string, or wind, of a size no greater than 1 size smaller than your own size. The instrument is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the instrument is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you may summon it into your possession as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You can never have more than one such instrument summoned at one time. Starting a song requires a standard action and maintaining one requires a move action. Starting a new song ends any previous songs. A creature can only be under the effects of one song at a time; should a creature affected by one be subjected to another, the caster (not necessarily the performer, if using the Share Link talent) of the second effect must attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of the existing effect's caster. All options are sonic mind-affecting effects with medium range unless noted. You may perform, singing or playing (either on the summoned instrument or another that you possess) the songs listed below. Bewitching Melody:  You may perform a haunting melody that opens the minds of those who hear it to outside influence, inflicting a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against charm effects on all hostile creatures. Dancing Tune:  You play a bouncy jig that compels any creature within close range to dance and caper. A creature can resist by attempting a Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as you continue to play. Once a creature succeeds at the save against this song, it is immune to further instances originating from you for 24 hours. This is a compulsion effect. Distracting Cacophony:  You may fill the air with discordant notes, granting all creatures within medium range a +2 (+1 per 7 caster levels) bonus on saves against sonic effects, but imposing an equal penalty on hearing-based Perception checks and concentration checks. The penalty portion of this ability is not a mind-affecting effect. Lullaby:  You may play a peaceful lullaby to inflict a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against effects that cause sleep or the staggered condition on all hostile creatures. Performing one of these songs will occupy limbs and voice appropriate to the instrument (if any) such that they cannot be used to for other performances (such as bardic music) at the same time."
    },
    "fade (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You fade from view while in a creature's peripheral vision. You gain concealment from any creature that you are flanking. You may dismiss this fey-blessing as a standard action to make a Stealth check to hide. You may reduce this to a swift action by spending a spell point. You may make this check even if you are observed and have no concealment. Any creature that fails its Perception check cannot see you and treats you as having full concealment until the start of your next turn. Making an attack, casting a spell or sphere ability with verbal or somatic components or subject to the Magical Signs drawback, speaking, or other loud or distracting actions ends this effect."
    },
    "fairy dust (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "By activating this fey-blessing, you gain a pouch of fairy dust. This pouch has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. The pouch is weightless and may not be used to hold anything other than the fairy dust it contains. If the pouch is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends. Destroying the pouch fills a 10-ft. radius with the chosen fairy dust, affecting all creatures in the area, including the caster. A successful saving throw against any effect that allows it grants the affected creature immunity to that effect from that caster for 24 hours. You gain knowledge of two types of fairy dust when you gain this talent; you may activate any one type of dust that you know when activating this fey -blessing. Choose from the following options: Amnesia:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or forget the past minute. This otherwise functions as the Amnesia talent of the Mind sphere. You must spend an additional spell point for this option. Bleed:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or bleed profusely when wounded. The next time the creature takes hit point damage, it begins taking bleed damage equal to your caster level. These bleed damage may be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or by receiving any amount of healing. If this dust is applied to a weapon, the weapon attack triggers the bleed damage. Blind:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Reflex save or treat all other creatures as having concealment for 1 round per caster level. Charm:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or have its disposition toward you increase by 1 step to a maximum of friendly for 1 minute. Fear:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or be shaken for 1 round per caster level. You may spend an additional spell point as part of activating the fey-blessing to instead have affected creatures be frightened for 1 round per caster level on a failed save and shaken for 1 round on a successful save. Glitter:  For 1 round per caster level, affected creatures take a penalty to Stealth equal to caster level and do not gain concealment from any effect that provides invisibility. Poison:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or suffer from itching poison, being compelled to scratch at the wound for 1 round (treat this as being dazed) and taking 1d2 Strength damage per round for 1 minute or until they succeed on a Fortitude save. You must spend an additional spell point for this option. Sleep:  Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1 round per caster level. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). You must spend an additional spell point for this option. As a standard action, you may fill a 5-ft. cube within close range with the dust, affecting any creature in that space. As a move action, you may apply fairy dust to a weapon, natural weapon, or piece of ammunition, or to a number of weapons or pieces of ammunition equal to your casting ability modifier (minimum 2) as a standard action. A creature that is struck by the weapon within 1 round per caster level of it being so treated suffers from the effects of the dust. You may chose to end this fey-blessing early, drawing and throwing the pouch to create a 20-ft. radius spread of fairy dust within close range, affecting all creatures within the area. The duration of multiple applications of dust stack. The pouch replenishes itself as a free action for the duration of the fey-blessing, then disappears when it ends. You may have multiple instances of this fey-blessing active at once; select a different option you know for each. Each instance creates a separate pouch. You may select this talent multiple times; each time you gain two more types of fairy dust. If the pouch is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you can summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. If you possess Fairy Flight, you also gain the following option: Flight:  For 1 minute per caster level, affected creatures gain the benefits of your Fairy Flight fey-blessing. This flight speed requires maintaining the proper frame of mind; if an affected creature is under the effects of an emotion or fear effect while flying, its fly speed from this ability is suppressed and it falls at a rate of 50 ft. per round until it lands (taking falling damage as normal) or the emotion or fear effect ends."
    },
    "fairy flight (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You sprout wings (which can appear as insectile, feathered, or made of leaves at the caster's choice); you take no damage when falling and may glide, moving with a speed of 30 ft with maneuverability (poor), but falling 1 ft for every 5 ft. traveled. At 5th caster level, you gain a fly speed of 30 ft with maneuverability (poor). This improves by 5 ft. and one maneuverability category (to a maximum of perfect) for each 5 additional caster levels. This is a polymorph effect."

    "fae light (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You shed light like a torch. You may alter the color, extinguish, or resume this effect as a free action. If you possess the Light sphere, you may count as being under the effects of your own glow while this fey-blessing is active. As a standard action, you may create a light that sheds light like a torch within medium range. You may move this light 30 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels per round as a move action, though it must stay within range of you. This light persists for the duration of the fey-link or until you create another one. You may choose to have either your light or the moveable light shed an enchanting glow. Creatures within a 30-ft. radius of the light must succeed on a Will save or be fascinated. A creature that successfully saves is immune to your use of this ability for 24 hours. If a creature fails its saving throw, it approaches to stand adjacent to the light and follows it if it moves. As normal, fascinated creatures suffer a -4 penalty to Perception, but cease to be fascinated if attacked or approached with an obviously hostile intent, such as someone drawing a weapon. This is a mind-affecting effect. You may alter the color or dismiss the light as a free action."

    "feast and famine (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Putrid Vomit:  You can spew vomit up to 30 ft. as a standard action. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with no range increment. A creature struck by this attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be for sickened for 1d4 rounds. If you spend a spell point as part of making the attack, the creature is instead nauseated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save and sickened for 1 round on a successful save. Spoilage:  As an instantaneous effect, you may cause an amount of food sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to spoil. This does not remove other changes made to the food, such as adding poison or magical effects unless you spend a spell point and succeed on a magic skill check against the poison or effect's DC. Restoring the food does not prevent future spoilage. Unspoil:  As an instantaneous effect, you may cause an amount of spoiled food sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to return to a palatable state. This does not remove other changes made to the food, such as adding poison or magical effects unless you spend a spell point and succeed on a magic skill check against the poison or effect's DC. Restoring the food does not prevent future spoilage."

    "feline omens (fey-blessing) [catgirl hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following as fey-blessings: Bayun's Meow:  You can produce a dreadful, baying meow. As a move action, all other creatures within close range must succeed at a Will save or be deafened and shaken for 1 round per 5 caster levels (minimum 1). This is a fear and sonic effect. Whenever you use this ability, you may choose to target a single creature rather than affect all creatures in the area. Cait Sidhe Taigham:  You demand tithe and tribute from others. As a standard action, you may compel one adjacent creature to deliver an object you designate (held in their hands or on their person) to you during their next turn. An affected target uses their standard action to deliver the requested object during their next turn. You may receive the object with an unoccupied hand, otherwise the object is set down in front of you. A successful Will save negates this effect; a creature may only be the target of this fey-blessing once every 24 hours. Grimalkin's Shade:  When you activate this fey-blessing, you summon a small grimalkin shade (or \"shade\") which takes the form of a cat's shadow in an unoccupied, adjacent square. This shade acts as an independent creature, listens to your commands, and will attempt to fulfill them to the best of its ability. The grimalkin cannot speak normally, but understands any language you speak and may communicate normally with you or anyone who can speak to a cat. While not in combat or not being ordered to complete a task, the shade behaves much like a cat, and may be affectionate or cold to those around it at its discretion. The shade acts on your initiative and must remain within medium range of you or have its tether to your magic become greatly weakened. If the shade would take damage while outside of this range and weakened, it is immediately dismissed and this fey-blessing ends. You may only have a single shade summoned at one time; if the shade would die, you may summon a new shade as a full-round action. When this fey-blessing ends, the shade is automatically dismissed. Grimalkin Shade The grimalkin shade is a creature which has simplified statistics using the caster's statistics or caster level, determined when the fey-blessing is cast. Core Statistics \n hp  5 + 3 per caster level; Hit Dice 1/2 your caster level;  Size  Small;  Type  fey;  Senses  darkvision 120 ft., see in darkness;  Perception  10 + your caster level \n Str  10,  Dex  10,  Con  10,  Int  10,  Wis  10,  Cha  10 \n AC  11 + your caster level (10 + size + caster level);  Saving Throws  2 + 1/2 your caster level \n Speed  40 ft. \n Skills  Acrobatics, Perception, Stealth equal to 10 + your caster level Attacks Shade's Chill (Su):  The grimalkin's chill can be felt, permeating through cloth and chilling bone. The grimalkin makes a melee touch attack (5 + your caster level). If successful, the target takes 1d4 untyped energy damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d4) and must attempt a Will saving throw or be shaken for 1 round (using your Fallen Fey sphere DC). If the target is already shaken and fails their saving throw, the target is instead frightened for 1 round. This touch attack may be made while corporeal or incorporeal, and may be used as a standard action attack or attack of opportunity. \n Vanish (Su):  The grimalkin may spend a swift action to become incorporeal. The grimalkin may remain incorporeal indefinitely and may become corporeal as a standard action. While incorporeal, the grimalkin may attempt a Stealth check to hide in any dim light or darkness, even while observed. Other Information and Statistics \nThe grimalkin does not possess feats and does not possess skill ranks, but does possess skill bonuses as indicated in its core statistics. Despite being a size Small creature, other creatures may freely move through a square the grimalkin occupies without penalty, and the grimalkin may share its space with other creatures.

      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Evasion:  You gain the evasion ability. When you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage. This ability does not function when wearing medium or heavier armor.

      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Collateral Damage:  Whenever a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may redirect the attack to another creature within the attacking creature's reach as an immediate action. Make a new attack roll with the original bonus to determine the result. Jinx:  As a standard action, you can place a curse on a single creature within close range. A Will save negates the effect. On a failed save, the target is cursed for the duration of your feylink. The victim of the curse takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill and ability checks until the curse is removed. This penalty increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. A creature can only be affected by a single jinx at one time. This is a curse effect. A creature that succeeds on the save against this effect is immune to that caster's use of it for 24 hours. Pugwampi's Aura:  All hostile creatures within 30 ft. of you take a -1 bonus to all saving throws. This penalty increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. A creature benefiting from any luck bonus ignores this penalty. Stymie Channeling:  Any hostile creature that attempts to channel energy within 30 ft. of you must succeed on a Will save or be unable to channel for that round. The use is not lost, but the action is wasted."

    "long step (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "For the duration of the fey-link, you can teleport up to 10 ft. as a move action. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity and you must have line of sight to your destination. This distance increases by 5 ft. at 4th caster level and every 2 caster levels thereafter. If you possess Tree Meld, while melded to a tree, you may move to another tree within close range as a move action or medium range as a standard action. Once you use this ability, you may not do so again for 1d4 rounds."

    "mantle of autumn (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Cloak of Leaves:  You may surround yourself in swirling leaves in a 10-ft. radius as a move action. This radius increases by 5 ft. at 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter. All allied creatures fully within this area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss chance). If hostile creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area, the targets also have concealment. You may end this effect as a free action. Doing so removes the leaves at the end of your turn but does not end the fey-blessing; you may create and dismiss the cloak of leaves for the duration of the fey-blessing. Touch of the Harvest:  You may touch food-producing plants, causing them to sprout food spontaneously. You may touch a plant within your natural reach as a move action. Each plant produces enough food to provide 3 Medium-sized creatures or 1 horse with food for a day. This fey-blessing ends after you touch a number of plants equal to your caster level. This ability requires requires fruit trees, berry bushes, or food crops."

    "mantle of spring (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Plant Growth:  A single plant or creature of the plant type that you touch increases its size by one category. This increases to two categories at 10th caster level and one additional category every 10 caster levels thereafter. This effect persists for as long as you are within 30 ft. of the target, until you end it as a free action, you choose to apply it to a different target, or the fey-link ends. Unwilling creatures are permitted a Will save to negate this effect. This effect bypasses the immunity to polymorph effects of the plant type. For creatures of the plant type, adjust statistics per the following table: Adjusted Size \n Str \n Dex \n Con \n \n \n Diminutive \n - \n -2 \n - \n \n \n Tiny \n +2 \n -2 \n - \n \n \n Small \n +4 \n -2 \n - \n \n \n Medium \n +2 \n -2 \n - \n \n \n Large \n +4 \n -2 \n +2 \n \n \n Huge \n +4 \n -2 \n +2 \n \n \n Gargantuan \n +4 \n - \n +2 \n \n \n Colossal \n +4 \n - \n +2 This ability cannot cause creatures to grow larger than Huge. At 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter, this limit increases by one size category, to a maximum of Colossal at 15th caster level. This is a polymorph effect. Verdant Step:  You may cause flowers, grass, and small vines to spring up wherever you step. The rapid, clinging growth creates difficult terrain in any space you enter until the start of your next turn. You are not hindered by this difficult terrain. This effect may be halted or resumed as a free action. If you spend a spell point as a free action, this growth instead remains for 1 minute per caster level. This ability does not function if you are not touching the ground. This growth is considered sufficient to be a target by any abilities of the plantlife package of the Nature sphere that requires plants (but not large growths such as trees) until the start of your next turn or for 1 minute per caster level when using the spell point option. After this time expires, the growth fades away and any ongoing effects requiring it end."

    "misplacement (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "For the duration of the fey-link, you gain an uncanny ability to meddle with the possessions of other creatures. You may perform the Steal combat maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity and may use your ranks in the Sleight of Hand skill in place of your base attack bonus when determining your combat maneuver check for the Steal combat maneuver. Any time you make a Sleight of Hand check or Steal combat maneuver against a creature within your natural reach, you may also rearrange its possessions. The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item it finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged, thus requiring a standard action to retrieve a stored item or draw a weapon (unless you have stolen the item in question). After spending this standard action, the creature takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability. You may choose to replace items you've stolen with worthless material (twigs, sand, etc.) that you have in your possession (but not something that has an effect like a primed grenade or cursed object) with a equal or lesser weight to the stolen object. This does not increase the difficulty of your Sleight of Hand checks."

    "natural dominion (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "Choose one of the following creature types: animal, plant, or vermin. As a standard action you may command one creature of that type within 30 ft. of you whose CR does not exceed your caster level. If the creature fails a Will save, its disposition toward you increases to helpful for the duration of the fey blessing. Mindless creatures and creatures of animal intelligence (Intelligence 2 or lower) can be given simple commands as a swift action and will obey your orders even if dangerous or suicidal. Creatures of higher intelligence will fight for you and defend you, but will not obey suicidal orders. You may have multiple instances of this fey-blessing active simultaneously, but you may only command a single creature at a time; attempting to command a new creature, even of a different type, dismisses your influence on any previous creature, returning it to its previous disposition. This is a mind-affecting compulsion that bypasses the type-based immunity to mind-affecting effects granted by the plant and vermin types. A creature that succeeds on its save against this ability becomes immune to that caster's use of it for 24 hours."

You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls when using such a weapon or ammunition. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. Stick Pixies:  You may spend a spell point to summon a creature of the plant type with a CR of no greater than your caster level/3 as a 1-round action. A creature summoned this way gains the fey subtype, and is treated as a fey in addition to any other types it may possess. The creature appears within 30 feet of you and remains and serves you for the duration of your feylink. The creature obeys your commands, but unless you speak the creature's language, or are able to speak with plants, only basic communication is possible (attacking an enemy, defending the caster, etc.). The total Hit Dice of plants called at one time cannot exceed your caster level (temporary increases to caster level such as the thaumaturge's forbidden lore ability or implements of the Fallen Fey sphere do not increase this capacity nor the highest CR creature you may summon). Attempting to summon an additional plant forces you to dismiss a number of existing plants to bring the total under this limit. If a summoned creature expends abilities with a limited use, those abilities are expended for all creatures of the same kind. Likewise, a creature that gains immunity to an ability of a summoned creature gains immunity to that ability originating from all creatures of that type that you summon. Sugar Sticks:  You manifest a tube of sugary-sweet pixie dust for the duration of this fey-blessing. You may consume this pixie dust as a swift action, or feed to another willing creature as a standard action. Consuming the pixie dust restores 1 hit point per caster level. A creature cannot consume pixie dust more than once every 10 minutes. The tube replenishes itself as a free action for the duration of the fey-blessing, then disappears when it ends. If the tube is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you can summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it."

This effect is broken for a given creature if you or an ally attacks it. Plant Empathy:  You gain wild empathy as the druid class feature, but only affecting creatures of the plant type, bypassing the immunity to mind-affecting effects granted by the plant type. This ability treats swarms of the plant type as if they were one creature possessing a single mind. Wood Defense:  You gain damage reduction equal to caster level against wood. This applies to weapons composed entirely of plant matter (staves, clubs, etc.), the natural attacks or creatures of the plant type, and to magical effects manipulating or creating plants (the pummel geomancing option of the plantlife package of the Nature sphere, the wall of thorns spell, etc.)."

    "shadow collector (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Shadow Reaver:  You do not cast a shadow. When you kill a living creature with CR of at least half your Hit Dice that has a shadow, you gain 1 temporary spell point that expires after 1 minute and cast the shadow of that creature until the spell point is lost. Steal Shadow:  You may spend a spell point when making a Steal attempt against a creature that has a shadow, stealing its shadow instead of any item if successful. Creatures who have their shadows stolen gain 1 temporary negative level and lose 1 spell point. This loss increases by one die size (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.) for every five caster levels. Creatures that possess spell slots instead lose spell slots, based on the level of the slot. Each slot is equivalent to a number of spell points: level 1-2: 1 spell point, 3-5: 2 spell points, 6-8: 3 spell points, 9: 4 spell points. You gain an equal number of temporary spell points that expire after 1 minute, though cannot gain more spell points than the target loses. These temporary spell points do not stack with spell points from other targets, other instances of this ability, or any other source and expire after one round per caster level. This ability does not grant a way to use spell points to those that lack one. You may restore shadows as a standard action, removing the negative level. Shadows are restored automatically at the end of your fey-link, or may be reclaimed by a Steal maneuver at any time or as a standard action with a touch if you are helpless or unconscious."

    "snare setter (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may make a snare that functions as a magic trap. You may conjure and set a snare as a standard action in a square within close range, which blends with its surroundings (DC 20 + caster level Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. The cord-like object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled and preventing it from moving from that space. The snare is magical and can be dispelled as a sphere effect. To escape, a trapped creature must make an Escape Artist check or Strength check equal to your sphere DC as a full-round action. The snare has AC and hit points equal to your caster level and hardness equal to half your caster level. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the effect, though not the fey-blessing. A snare persists until triggered or until the fey-link ends. Only one snare may be set at a time; setting an additional snare dismisses all previous snares."

    "spores (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Anxiety Spores:  As a swift action or move action, you may coat a weapon, piece of ammunition, or natural weapon you possess with anxiety spores. You may coat those of a willing ally as a move action. The next time that the coated weapon (or piece of ammunition) is used to deal damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be infested with the spores. Anxiety Spores:  Disease\u2014injury;  save  Fort DC (sphere DC);  onset  1 round;  frequency  1/minute;  effect  cumulative \u20131 penalty on saving throws against emotion and fear effects (maximum \u20135);  cure  2 consecutive saves As a standard action, you can spend a spell point to cause mushrooms to erupt from any creature within close range already infected with its anxiety spores. The targeted creature takes 1d2 points of Charisma damage (Fortitude negates) as the growing spores siphon away its emotions. This damage increases by one die size for every 4 caster levels (1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, etc.). If the affected creature is currently shaken, frightened, or panicked, any creature within 10 ft. gains the same condition for 1d4 rounds (Will save negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Fungal Snare:  You may create and hurl a fungal mass up to 30 ft. as a standard action, which explodes in a mass of sticky filaments with a radius of 5 ft. + 5 ft. per 7 caster levels. Once you do so, you may not use this ability again for 1d4 rounds. All creatures within this area must succeed on a Reflex save or be entangled and unable to move. Breaking free of the entangled condition is a move action, requiring either a Strength check or an Escape Artist check against the effect's save DC. Additionally, the area counts as difficult terrain for 1 minute per caster level. The filaments may be destroyed by dealing 3 damage per caster level; doing so if sufficient to clear a single 5-ft. square. The filaments have vulnerability to fire."

    "stone shape (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You gain a competence bonus on Craft checks equal to your caster level for items primarily composed of stone and may craft such objects as if you had the appropriate tools. As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to turn an adequately sized piece of stone into 50 pieces of ammunition, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or a weapon normally primarily composed of wood or metal. Objects created this way have twice their normal weight and weapons gain the fragile quality; this quality is retained even when gaining an enhancement bonus. You must succeed on the appropriate Craft check to make the chosen item as part of this action or else the item gains the broken condition, though you may attempt to shape it again. The item is considered masterwork and, if a weapon or suit of armor, gains an enhancement bonus equal to your caster level/5 (minimum 0). Equipment made this way returns to its original form when your fey-link ends. Using special types of stone imparts the properties of that stone to the shaped object. If using stone taken from a larger piece of stone, the larger stone takes damage equal to the hit points of the item (before enhancement), ignoring hardness and dealing full damage to objects, which can be restored by putting the item back in place and dismissing the effect as a standard action. You can spend a spell point as a standard action to restore 1d6 + caster level hit points to an object made primarily of stone or to a construct composed of stone (such as a stone golem)."

You may hear (but not see nor benefit from other special senses) what happens around the tree, and while minor physical damage to the tree does not harm you, any partial or complete destruction of the tree (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.

Once a creature succeeds on the save against this effect, it is immune to any instance of it originating from you for 24 hours. You may suppress or resume this effect as a free action. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Aura of Shattered Loyalties:  Any hostile creature within 30 ft. of you that is shaken, frightened, panicked or cowering is unable to benefit from aid another bonuses, flanking, or teamwork feats and does not count as a willing target of its allies' spells.

Icebeard:  You become rimed in jagged ice (often taking the form of a jutting beard, but formations vary according to the caster), posing a serious threat to anyone attacking the you in melee. An adjacent attacker must make a Reflex save or take 1d4 points of slashing damage when it succeeds on an attack roll against you. At 3rd caster level, this ability also deals 1d6 cold damage. This piercing damage increases by 1d4 at 6th caster level and every 6 caster levels thereafter and the cold damage by 1d6 at 9th caster level and every 9 caster levels thereafter.

As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to turn an adequately sized piece of wood (including wood from a living plant) into 50 pieces of ammunition, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or a weapon normally primarily composed of wood. A weapon that normally would have a metal head, spike, or blade has its damage die reduced by one size. You must succeed on the appropriate craft check to make the chosen item as part of this action or else the item gains the broken condition, though you may attempt to shape it again. The item is considered masterwork and, if a weapon or suit of armor, gains an enhancement bonus equal to your caster level/5 (minimum 0). Equipment made this way returns to its original form when your fey-link ends. Using special types of wood imparts the properties of that wood to the shaped object. If using wood from a living plant, the plant takes damage equal to the hit points of the item (before enhancement), ignoring hardness and dealing full damage to objects, which can be restored by putting the item back in place and dismissing the effect as a standard action. If an entire plant was used, it may be planted in a suitable location and the effect dismissed. You can spend a spell point as a standard action to restore 1d6 + caster level hit points to an object made primarily of wood or to a creature of the plant type."

    "zolavoi\u2019s mantle (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Cindercloud:  You may exude a cloud of smoke and embers in a 10-ft. radius as a move action. This radius increases by 5 ft. at 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter. All creatures fully within this area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss chance). If creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area, the targets also have concealment. Any creature other than you that enters or starts its turn inside this area takes fire damage equal to your caster level. This damage cannot be taken more than once per round by an individual creature. You may end this effect as a free action. Doing so removes the cloud at the end of your turn but does not end the fey-blessing; you may create and dismiss cinderclouds for the duration of the fey-blessing. Sense Object:  You may spend a full-round action to discern the distance and direction to one object that was within your possession for at least 24 hours prior to it leaving your possession within the past 1 day per caster level. You may only target a single object with each activation of this fey-blessing; selecting another object requires spending a spell point and dismisses the previous instance. Smokesight:  You can see clearly through ash, fire, and smoke (including the cindercloud ability above) as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring miss chance from these obstructions, up to the normal limits of your vision.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  8th caster or higher. This talent requires the optional Traveling Through Faerie rules found below. As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to make a melee touch attack against a creature and hurl it into Faerie. This provokes an attack or opportunity. A successful Will save negates this ability. Once within Faerie, if the target creature wishes to return to where it previously was, it must travel 1d12 miles to reach a fairy circle and find a way through, arriving within 1d6 miles of its former location. This is a teleportation effect."

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  10th caster or higher. Any humanoid within 30 ft. of you that looks at you must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 minute per caster level. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune to your use of this ability for 24 hours. You may suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

    "bound to nature (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  10th caster or higher. If you are slain while under the effects of this fey-blessing, you immediately reincarnate as the reincarnate spell at the start of your next turn (based on when your next turn would be, if you were not dead). You return in your same space, or the nearest space that is not intrinsically dangerous, though your equipment remains in the place you died. You may choose to delay your reincarnation by up to 1 hour. Upon your return, all spell slots and spell points you possessed are lost and you gain 1 negative level until you rest to regain spell points (this negative level replaces the negative levels normally incurred by the reincarnate spell). If you are slain by an effect that would prevent reincarnation, you may attempt a magic skill check against that effect to return regardless. You gain a +2 on this check if in a natural setting (not in a settlement or artificial structure). Once you have been reincarnated by this ability, you cannot benefit from it for 1 week."

    "drowning kiss (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  10th caster or higher. You can flood the lungs of a willing, helpless, or fascinated creature by touching it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips) as a standard action. If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. On its turn, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to cough up this water; otherwise it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, the target must save again or drop to \u20131 hit points and be dying; on the third round it must save again or die. Succeeding at any of these Fortitude saves causes the target to cough up the water and no longer be drowning, ending the effect. Activating this fey-blessing costs an additional spell point."

You may spend a 1-round action to determine the direction to the nearest fairy ring. You may open a fairy ring with a 10 minute ritual or by spending a spell point as a standard action. Once opened, creatures may pass through the fairy ring into the realm of Faerie. The ring remains open for 3d6 rounds. While in Faerie, you may spend a 1-round action to determine the direction to the fairy ring connected to the spot nearest your desired destination. When rolling on the Time Difference table, you may spend two spell points to shift the result by one step in the direction of your choice.

    "fey invisibility (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Fade, 10th caster or higher. You may fade from view, becoming invisible. Creatures must make Perception checks to detect you. You gain a bonus to your Stealth checks equal to your caster level. You lose the benefit of this effect until the start of your next turn any time you take any action other than a free action. In addition, since you are invisible, you may make Stealth checks even while being observed and do not require cover to retain or initiate Stealth. Even when detected by another creature, an invisible creature gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against sighted targets and ignores their Dexterity bonus to AC. Attacks against the invisible creature have a 50% chance they will simply miss, even if the attack has targeted the correct square. Making yourself invisible also hides any magical auras on yourself or your worn or held equipment from such effects as detect magic or the base Divination sphere divine ability. Activating this fey-blessing costs an additional spell point."

    "steal skin (fey-blessing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  5th caster or higher. As a full-round action, you may steal the skin of a creature of Small, Medium, or Large size with a roughly humanoid shape. The target creature must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is alive, you must make a successful coup de grace attack to steal its skin. Should the creature survive this, it is nauseated as a pain effect, takes Constitution bleed of 1d4, bleed damage equal to three times your caster level, and takes a -10 penalty on saves against disease until its skin is regrown by regeneration or a similar effect. Should this bleed damage be halted by any means, it restarts in 1d4 rounds. You then may don or remove the stolen skin as a move action. When wearing a stolen skin, you take on the likeness of the skin's original owner, including the victim's voice, build, and size, but gain none of the creature's abilities. The stolen skin grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature, with none of the usual penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen skins are preserved for the duration of the fey-blessing and remain as supple as living skin. You may only have a single skin stolen at a time; stealing another forces you to discard any previously stolen skins. Discarded skins rot and decay normally. Discarded skins may not be reused.

    "fairy rings": {
      "benefits": "Fairy rings can be found in any wilderness. They are never present in any developed area unless deliberately created. A ring is usually within 1d6 miles of any given wilderness location. If using a 6 mile hex map, each hex that lacks a settlement of city size or larger will have 1d2 natural fairy rings. Hexes with cities or larger settlements will have only 1 natural fairy ring. The fairy ring consists of a circle 5 to 10 ft. in diameter, consisting of coral (salt water oceans only), mushrooms, small stones, or wildflowers. Noticing the formation requires a DC 10 Perception check (modified for distance) and identifying it requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If exploring a hex, any fairy rings in that hex can be located with a DC 10 perception or Knowledge (nature) check as part of the normal exploration. Once located, rings may be opened using the Open Fairy Ring ritual or by those with the Faerie Ring Traveler advanced talent. Once opened, the gate formed to faerie remains open for 1d6 minutes, though fey creatures of sufficient power can hold it open longer or close it sooner. Rings tend to serve as focal points for local fey activity as well as attracting magical beasts native to the area. Accessing the ring may prove difficult without bargaining with the local fey and magic beast population. There is a 70% chance of a random encounter appropriate to the environment at each end of the fairy ring. Creatures larger than the size of the ring may have difficulty passing through; most rings are of Medium or Large size, occupying squares accordingly; a creature whose size is no larger than the size of the circle may pass through unimpeded. Creatures of one size larger may pass by squeezing. Creatures of two or more sizes larger cannot pass unless they possesses an ability allowing them to squeeze through small openings. Fairy rings can be broken if a section of them is destroyed. Each 5-ft. square that contains a ring or part of a ring can be targeted individually. The ring has an AC and touch AC of 10, with hardness 0 for flowers and mushrooms or 10 for coral and rocks, and each square has 30 hit points. Once broken, a ring cannot be opened until it is repaired. A fairy ring counts as a magic item with a caster level of 5 (higher level rings can exist) for the purposes of restoring its hit points, repairing it, or suppressing it's magic. The region of faerie the ring opens into is not apparent before crossing through, though the local fey are usually knowledgeable (if accurate information can be obtained from them) and may even be willing to open the way to favored persons. The connection point of a given ring may drift with time; using the same ring days apart is reliable, but over the course of a month it may change somewhat (roll 1d3; on a 1, move the random location result up one entry, on a 2 it is unchanged, on a 3 move down one entry) and over a year it may change significantly (re-roll).

    "traveling through faerie": {
      "benefits": "The land of Faerie is a place where the usual rules of time, space, and location do not apply. Sometimes time moves faster or slower, and yet, a place might have a permanent weather pattern or even time of day, which changes as slowly as the seasons do on the material plane. The denizens of Faerie might populate entire cities, and look upon an intruder from the material plane with as much distrust as a mortal city might look upon a visiting ogre. As such, while the PCs might have incredible adventures in the realm of Faerie as determined by them and the GM, most mortal visitors to the world of Faerie do so only temporarily; using Faerie as a shortcut for their desired travels in the mortal world. Once in Faerie, the travelers must locate a fairy ring that connects to a spot near their desired destination. Friendly denizens of the plane may be willing to help and indifferent ones may be bribed or persuaded to give directions. Once the return ring's location is known, reaching it requires crossing 1d12 miles. There is a 25% chance each mile that the terrain will change (roll on Table 7.1). Random encounters are rolled for each hour of travel. When the destination is reached, just as with entering, there is a 70% chance of a random encounter appropriate to the environment at either end of the fairy ring. Once the fairy ring has been reached, it may be opened by the same methods and passing through will deposit you near your target destination, with the distance determined by how successful you were in selecting it. See the below table: Table 7.2 Distance from destination Destination Accuracy \n Distance \n \n \n Correctly Identified \n 1d6 miles \n \n \n Close \n 1d6 miles per mile traveled in fairy \n \n \n Random \n 1d20 miles per mile traveled in fairy \n \n \n Malicious Misinformation \n 1d100 miles per mile traveled in fairy Be aware that time travels differently in Faerie.

    "fairy mounds": {
      "benefits": "Fairy mounds allow travel without these difficulties. Each side of the portal in a fairy mound remains fixed unless sundered by powerful magic and the difference in time flow is fixed by the mound's creator. As the locations are known and constant, encounters at the mound are not random. However, creatures with the power to create such mounds rarely do so without cause. Mounds will usually be found deep in the desmenes of powerful lords of faerie and watched and guarded appropriately. Setting Application This section is not intended to present settings or advocate particular sets of options, but simply to present thoughts on different ways fey creatures and Faerie can be used to color and enrich a setting."
    },
    "faerie?": {
      "benefits": "While throughout this book it is assumed that there is a separate plane that is the home or origin of fey creatures, this may not be true in all settings. In building or modifying a setting, it is important to ask what you want different elements to do. In some types of game, the fey are simply a creature type, more magical than humanoids, less strange than aberrations, and less aligned than outsiders. If that is all you need, the rest of this chapter may be of little interest. Fey creatures could also be representatives of the natural world. If so, there isn't necessarily a need for them to originate elsewhere; they are simply spirits tied to trees, streams, and rocks. Some work very well for this, such as dryads with their bond to trees and their nature magic. Others are less obvious. In addition to or instead of representing nature, they can represent other things, selecting creatures as appropriate. Not every creature is appropriate for every setting and selecting or modifying creatures to suit the desired framework is a valuable tool for setting-building. Having a separate plane offers some benefits. Adventures can be based on traveling through Faerie and having an entire plane makes room for all kinds of fey that may not fit well with narrower themes. Plots can also involve the relations between planes. Is Faerie at risk of invasion from the abyss? Do fey lords strive to increase their power by subsuming parts of the material plane into their domains?"
    },
    "the courts": {
      "benefits": "Courts are a convenient way to group fey creatures bound by some similar characteristics. This does not require that the courts are solitary, global, or exclusive. It is possible to have all fey tied to a court and each court organized into a single body, but this is by no means the only option. There may be many regions with or without a separate plane and each may have separate and even competing structures. There is no need for all fey to be tied to a court; court politics may only be of interest to a limited set of fey. Possibilities range from having one or two high fey that dominate a rigid structure all the way down to the lowliest brownie and gremlin to there being multitudinous 'courts', each based around a creature slightly more influential than the others, with membership in constant flux. Moving towards the former emphasizes structure and the incredible power of alien beings and can work for showing how they are bound by rules, even if those rules are incomprehensible to mortals, while the later emphasizes the chaotic and variable nature frequently ascribed to fairies."
    },
    "seasons": {
      "benefits": "If emphasizing the fey link to nature, tying fey courts to the seasons can be useful. In temperate climates, this could simply give you summer and winter courts, mapped roughly over the seelie and unseelie mentioned previously, or could be expanded to give spring, summer, fall, and winter courts. Spring naturally carries themes of birth and rebirth, youth, growth, and change. The days are getting longer and the future is bright. On the darker side, the young are weak, the nights are still cold, and the melting snow can uncover buried secrets or cause sudden floods. Summer is reaching adulthood, heat, and possibly drought. It is most often a time of plenty and the long days are filled with light. Areas tied to summer have towering trees, summer flowers, and may never see sunset. By contrast, they can also be battered by terrible storms. Autumn also carries themes of change and transition, though mixes them with preparation, exemplified by the harvest. The dark and hunger of winter are in sight. Autumn regions are brilliantly colored in yellows, oranges, and red, with fruit hanging low from trees, but the wind is cool and there is an underlying unease. Winter is the death of the world, a time of cold and hunger. Winter region are filled with snow and ice. Food is scarce and the inhabitants see others as either predators or prey. If the setting is more focused on other regions, the fey there could instead be tied to wet and dry seasons, with a court of rain, flood, or monsoon opposed to a court of drought. Island fey may be divided between courts of land, sea, and storm, or even further divided between freshwater and saltwater. In any case, the courts do not necessarily require moral alignments; a summer tornado and a winter blizzard can both deal death and destruction and both are equally natural. Wild Magic"

This ability functions as the option to change cosmetic appearance per the Blank Form ability of the Alteration sphere. \n \n \n 43 \n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 44 \n For 1 hour per caster level, creatures within close range of the caster must roll twice and take the worst result on saving throws made against disease. \n \n \n 45 \n Bark grows over all creatures within close range of the caster, increasing their natural armor bonus by 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels for 1 minute. \n \n \n 46 \n The caster takes a number of points of ability damage to his casting attribute equal to the effect's caster level/4 (minimum 1) even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. \n \n \n 47 \n For the duration of the fey-link, any hostile creature within close range of the caster is sickened for 1 round whenever struck by a metal weapon. \n \n \n 48 \n The caster gains hooves as a satyr for the remainder of the fey-link and cannot benefit from any items in the boot magic item slot, which immediately fall off. \n \n \n 49 \n Ice forms around the feet and limbs of all allies within close range of the caster, who must succeed on a Reflex save or be entangled and unable to move. In addition, the affected creature's square becomes slick with ice and counts as difficult terrain. Breaking free of the entangled condition is a move action, requiring either a Strength check or Escape Artist check against the effect's save DC. A creature may also destroy the ice on a creature or square by dealing 3 points of damage per caster level to the ice. This removes the entangled condition from the creature and destroys the difficult terrain. The ice melts after 1 minute. \n \n \n 50 \n The caster is sickened for 1 round whenever struck by a metal weapon for the duration of the fey-link. \n \n \n 51 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 52 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4.

All creatures within the aura must roll twice and take the worst on all d20 rolls. Pugwampi gremlins, gnolls, and any creature benefiting from a luck bonus are immune to this effect. The caster is is subject to his own aura. \n \n \n 62 \n For the duration of the fey-link, the caster gains a sinister appearance, taking a penalty on all Charisma-based checks (except for intimidate) equal to the caster level/2 (minimum 1). \n \n \n 63 \n For the duration of the fey-link, any creature within close range of the caster is filled with a malevolent influence, taking a -4 penalty on any effect that would make him behave violently until they leave the affected area. \n \n \n 64 \n Ice forms around the feet and limbs of the caster who must succeed on a Reflex save or be entangled and unable to move. In addition, the caster's square becomes slick with ice and counts as difficult terrain. Breaking free of the entangled condition is a move action, requiring either a Strength check or Escape Artist check against the effect's save DC. A creature may also destroy the ice on a creature or square by dealing 3 points of damage per caster level to the ice. This removes the entangled condition from the creature and destroys the difficult terrain. The ice melts after 1 minute. \n \n \n 65 \n As an instantaneous effect, one tree (to a maximum size equal to that which you can control through the pummel geomancing ability) grows adjacent to the caster. The tree is under the effect of the pummel geomancing ability for 1d6 rounds and will attack the caster and its allies before attacking any other creature. \n \n \n 66 \n (Combat) All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Reflex save or become entangled by plants, shifting rocks, or ice as appropriate to the environment for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 67 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 68 \n A fiddle appears in the caster's possession, disappearing at the end of the fey-link. The caster gains the Skilled Casting (Perform (strings)) drawback for the remainder of the fey-link and must perform on the conjured fiddle. \n \n \n 69 \n For 24 hours, the caster is treated as having rolled a 1 on all checks made to influence evil aligned creatures of the fey type. \n \n \n 70 \n The casting time decreases by 1 step. \n \n \n 71 \n For 10 minutes per caster level, all creatures of the animal type within medium range of the caster have their disposition toward the caster reduced by 2 steps. \n \n \n 72 \n For 1 round per caster level, all hostile creatures of the animal type within medium range of the caster grow 1 size per the Size Change talent of the Alteration sphere. This effect stacks with other polymorph effects. \n \n \n 73 \n All hostile creatures within close range of the caster when the effect is cast gain vulnerability to cold iron for the duration of the fey-link. \n \n \n 74 \n The effect fails and the action is lost.

Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 76 \n All allied creatures within close range of the caster when the effect is cast gain vulnerability to cold iron for the duration of the fey-link. \n \n \n 77 \n All vegetation within medium range of the caster decrease in size for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 78 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 79 \n All creatures within close range of the caster when the effect is cast gain DR/cold iron equal to the caster level/2 (minimum 1) for the duration of the fey link. \n \n \n 80 \n All hostile creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Reflex save or become entangled by plants, shifting rocks, or ice as appropriate to the environment for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 81 \n The temperature of an area out to close range of the caster increases by 1 step (per the Weather sphere) for the duration on the fey-link. \n \n \n 82 \n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 83 \n Effect receives a +2 bonus to caster level. \n \n \n 84 \n The temperature of an area out to close range of the caster decreases by 1 step (per the Weather sphere) for the duration on the fey-link. \n \n \n 85 \n All vegetation within geomancing range of the caster increase in size for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 86 \n For the duration of the fey-link, any creature within close range of the caster gains DR equal to caster level against all weapons primarily composed of wood. \n \n \n 87 \n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \n \n \n 88 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 89 \n All creatures within close range of the caster at the time the effect is cast float 1 inch off the ground for the duration of the fey-link.

The caster and any creature who enters the area must make a Fort save or take -1 penalty (which increases by 1 per 5 caster levels) on all magic skill checks made to concentrate for 1 hour per caster level. This is a poison effect. \n \n \n 92 \n For 1 round per caster level, all creatures of the animal type within medium range of the caster grow 1 size category per the Size Change talent of the Alteration sphere. This effect stacks with other polymorph effects. \n \n \n 93 \n For the duration of the fey-link, any creature within close range of the caster is sickened for 1 round whenever struck by a metal weapon. \n \n \n 94 \n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1.

    "enchanting music (fey blessing)": {
      "benefits": "As a move action, you may summon one masterwork musical instrument, be it a percussion, string, or wind, of a size no greater than 1 size smaller than your own size. The instrument is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the instrument is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you may summon it into your possession as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You can never have more than one such instrument summoned at one time. You may perform, singing or playing (either on the summoned instrument or another that you possess) the songs listed below. Starting a song requires a standard action and maintaining one requires a move action. Starting a new song ends any previous songs. A creature can only be under the effects of one song at a time; should a creature affected by one be subjected to another, the caster (not necessarily the performer, if using the Share Link talent) of the second effect must make a magic skill check against the MSD of the existing effect's caster. All options are sonic mind-affecting effects with medium range unless noted. Bewitching Melody:  You may perform a haunting melody that opens the minds of those who hear it to outside influence, inflicting a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against charm effects on all hostile creatures. Distracting Cacophony:  You may fill the air with discordant notes, granting all creatures within medium range a +2 (+1 per 7 caster levels) bonus on saves against sonic effects, but imposing an equal penalty on hearing-based Perception checks and concentration checks. The penalty portion of this ability is not a mind-affecting effect. Dancing Tune:  You play a bouncy jig that compels any creature within close range to dance and caper. A creature can resist by making a Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as you continue to play. Once a creature makes the save against a this song, it is immune to further instances originating from you for 24 hours. This is a compulsion effect. Lullaby:  You may play a peaceful lullaby to inflict a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against effects that cause sleep or the staggered condition on all hostile creatures. Performing one of these songs will occupy limbs and voice appropriate to the instrument (if any) such that they cannot be used to for other performances (such as bardic music) at the same time."

      "benefits": "You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings: Hydrokinesis:  When touching a body of water, you may attempt the bullrush, drag, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuver against another creature touching that body of water within medium range as a standard action. Use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your casting attribute modifier in place of your Strength modifier for determining your combat maneuver bonus for this check. Failure on a trip attempt does not allow the target to trip you in return. You have no bonuses or penalties from size on this maneuver and are not limited by the size of your target. Waterspout:  When touching a body of water, you may attempt damage a creature touching that body of water within close range as a standard action. The targeted creature must succeed on a Reflex save or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd caster level and every 2 caster levels thereafter. Waveglide:  As a standard action, you can create waves and currents to double or halve the speed of creatures or objects traveling on the surface of the water, affecting up to 10 contiguous 5-ft. squares per caster level within long range. This requires line of effect to some part of the area, and lasts as long as you concentrate. An unwilling target can ignore the effect for 1 round by succeeding on a Will saving throw."

This bonus increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels possessed. The target also gains immunity to any spell or sphere effect that possesses or exercises mental control over them (including enchantment charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects), so long as that effect originates from a creature who possesses your opposed alignment. If the target is already under the influence of such an effect, the target is allowed to attempt a new saving throw against the controlling effect. Success means the effect is suppressed for the duration of this word, but resumes when this word expires.

    "arcana [bap]": {
      "benefits": "Where most normal motifs grant a brief glimpse of the target's fate, and ends with a short lived burst of power, some Fate casters learn to weave additional prophecy into their motifs. (Arcana) talents are unique (motif) talents which can either be cast normally as a motif or attached to another motif as part of casting it. When casting any motif, the caster may attach one (arcana) to that motif, which is hereafter referred to as the \"attached motif\". Attaching an (arcana) to a motif does not cost the caster any additional spell points or increase the casting time of the attached motif. While attached to another motif, an (arcana) talent functions in the following ways: An (arcana) shares its duration with the attached motif, and ends when the attached motif ends. \n An (arcana) does not grant bonuses while attached to another motif, and only adds its discharge effect to the attached motif's discharge (e.g. the pentacle's bonus to one saving throw would not apply while being attached and only grants the discharge benefit for rerolls on saving throws). \n An (arcana) cannot be discharged for its additional effect independently, and only grants its discharge effect when the attached motif is discharged. \n A caster may only attach one (arcana) to another (motif) talent, though feats, items, and other features may affect this. An (arcana) talent can not be attached to the same (arcana) when cast as a motif. For example, you cannot attach Swords to Swords as a motif, but can attach Swords to Cups as a motif."

      "benefits": "Some talents are marked (motif). These grant you motifs you can grant to targets. Less precise than divination, but more proactive, (motif) talents give an auspician a glimpse at the pattern of Fate's tapestry and allow her to nudge one or two threads in a direction she chooses. Unless otherwise noted, a talent with the (motif) tag is cast as a standard action on a target with a range of touch and costs one spell point. A successful Will save negates a motif, and motifs are subject to spell resistance. While they normally have a duration of 1 hour per level, the target can also discharge a (motif) talent as an immediate action to gain an instantaneous or short-lived benefit, after which the effect ends. The normal effect ends immediately upon being discharged, and is replaced by the instantaneous or short-lived benefit. A given creature can never have more than one instance of a particular (motif) talent active on them at a time; a second casting at an equal or higher caster level replaces the first, while a second casting at a lower level has no effect.

If you spend an additional spell point when casting this sphere effect, for a number of rounds equal to half your caster level, whenever an effect other than this talent would cause the target to become shaken (such as being demoralized with the Intimidate skill), the target take damage as though hit by a greataxe appropriately sized to you.

Any additional effects of the attack or effect, such as poison, inflicting bleed damage, or a saving throw against the effect, are also delayed. When this word ends (or immediately if this word is dispelled), the target immediately takes the delayed damage and incurs any additional effects of the delayed attack or effect, subject to any changes to immunity, resistances, damage reduction, etc. A given attack or effect cannot be delayed more than once. Abilities contingent on taking damage, such as redirecting damage with the Protection sphere Community talent, are resolved as normal when the target takes the delayed damage. An unwilling creature cannot be targeted by this word. If a creature is subject to this word while already under the effects of a previous Bargain word, the previous Bargain word ends and the creature takes the delayed attack or effect's damage immediately.

A target with the same alignment as you is unaffected, while all others are affected as follows: Table: Enmity Steps \n Effect \n \n \n 1 \n Sickened 1 minute \n \n \n 2 \n Staggered 1 round \n \n \n 3 \n Blind 1 round \n \n \n 4 \n Dazed 1 round These effects are cumulative and consecutive; for example, if a chaotic evil creature were affected by an Enmity word produced by a lawful good creature, it would be dazed for one round, then blind for one round, then staggered for one round, and finally sickened for one minute. As this power is cosmic in origin, it can affect undead, even though undead are usually immune to some of these conditions. A successful Will save negates this effect, but targets with an especially strong alignment aura opposing your alignment (such as chaotic or good for a lawful evil caster) take a penalty to their save: strong, -1; overwhelming, -2.

The description of the reason for placing the target under the effect is specific but no more than one short sentence. (For example, \"He killed my father,\" is generally appropriate, but \"I hate him,\" is not because it is not specific enough.)

The target may move and attack normally, even when under the influence of magic and effects that would otherwise impede movement. This includes paralysis, slow effects, entanglement, Blood Puppet, Hostile Lifts, etc. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail, and the subject automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

Once per round when the attacker deals damage to or succeeds on a combat maneuver check against the victim the attacker gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. This bonus increases by +1 for every 10 caster levels. Multiple bonuses from a single instance of this word stack with each other, up to your casting ability modifier, but not from other instances of the same word. Only direct damage gives the attacker this bonus; ongoing damage such as from acid arrow does not. As a swift action the attacker may change victims; this resets the bonus, and if the new victim succeeds on their Will save the effect ends. You may choose to instead place this word on a single creature, in which case it gains the bonus once per round when any other creature deals damage to or succeeds on a combat maneuver check against them.

Attempt a magic skill check with a +10 bonus against the lock's Disable Device DC or the door's Stuck DC. If the check is successful, the portal unlocks and opens. This word may open doors, chests, shackles, and chains, and any other type of fastening. It cannot, however, raise a barred gate, lift a portcullis, or otherwise provide force in and of itself. You may also spend a spell point and speak a word that magically holds shut a door, gate, chest, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The portal closes and, if a lock is present, becomes locked. The DC to open the lock or force open the portal both increase by 10.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Fate sphere, caster level 10th. You may act as an intermediary on behalf of your alignment. If you are connected to a deity or another source of power, you may also intercede on its behalf. By spending 2 spell points, you may allow the target to change its alignment or make amends for indiscretions in one of the following ways: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost. \n A paladin, cleric, druid, or any other caster whose casting tradition dictates their power comes from an aligned source may lose their powers through indiscretions or alignment changes. You may use this ability to restore that character's class levels or magic powers. Sometimes you or the deity you represent may require the target to undertake a quest, make a sacrifice, or perform some other action to prove its desire to atone before it can have its power restored in this fashion. \n You grant the creature the chance to instantly change its own alignment to match yours. The target may freely choose whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. Unless specified by the GM, this cannot work on outsiders or any other creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Note:  Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively."

They laughed, and played, and so the tall ones experienced both fortune and misfortune with a wave of their paws. Prerequisites:  Fate sphere, caster level 5th. You gain the following Fate sphere abilities which manipulate luck and rolled dice: Felicity (consecration):  While this consecration is in effect, the success and failure of all creatures in the area is manipulated. When you create this consecration, choose \"weal\" or \"woe\". If you chose \"weal\", all creatures treat a naturally rolled 19 on a d20 as though it were a natural 20. If you chose \"woe\", all creatures treat a naturally rolled 2 on a d20 as though it were a natural 1. This consecration's \"woe\" effect is considered a curse effect. For every 10 caster levels you possess, the range which weal and woe manipulate naturally rolls as 20 and 1 respectively increases by +1 (e.g. caster level 10 weal would treat a naturally rolled 18-20 as a natural 20). You must concentrate to maintain this consecration. You may always spend an additional spell point as a free action to allow this consecration to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. \n Boon (word):  After a creature within range makes a d20 roll, as an immediate action, you may grant the target a +1 luck bonus to that roll. If you spend 1 additional spell point, this bonus increases to +2 + 1 per 10 caster levels. You may use this word after the results of the d20 roll are revealed, which may change the results of the d20 roll into a success. \n Jinx (word) [curse]:  After a creature within range makes a d20 roll, as an immediate action, you may cause the target to suffer a -1 penalty to that roll. If you spend 1 additional spell point, this penalty increases to -2 - 1 per 10 caster levels. You may use this word after the results of the target's d20 roll are revealed, which may change the results of the d20 roll into a failure. An unwilling target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect.

If the circumstances would kill the target of this word the target is instead left at 1 hit point and the word ends. In order for this word to function, the circumstances must be sufficiently specific. For example, \"death at the hands of an orc,\" \"death in an ambush,\" \"death by fire,\" or \"death caused by the Telekinesis sphere\" would be acceptable; \"death by hit point damage\" or \"death at the hands of an enemy\" would not.

In addition, any damage dealt to creatures in the area (including you) is difficult to heal, even after this consecration ends. Half of it may be healed normally. The rest cannot be healed naturally (including by fast healing). Other effects can heal the damage only if the effect's originator succeeds on a Heal check against a DC of your MSD + your casting ability modifier. This DC increases by 8 unless it is made within an area infused with positive energy, such as produced by a consecrate spell or ritual.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Fate sphere, caster level 10th. You may spend 2 spell points and 10 minutes to place a geas on a touched target with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. A geas is a magical command that compels the target to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as declared when the geas is placed. The target is allowed a Will save to negate this effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the geas remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions. If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas. A geas cannot be dispelled, but it may be broken through the Break Enchantment Life talent, as well spells such as break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.

When the target discharges the chosen motif, they may either choose a different motif affecting the target to link this motif to or discharge this motif as part of the same action to grant all allies within 30 feet of them an insight bonus to saving throws equal to half your caster level for one round.

While this consecration is in effect, no living creature becomes disabled or dying within its area, nor do creatures die from loss of hit points. This does not protect creatures from these effects once this consecration ends or they leave the area, nor does it protect them from death from other causes.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Fate sphere (any one (motif), any one (arcana)), caster level 10th. Your ability to glimpse and actualize your target's fate heightens. (Arcana) talents attached to a motif grant bonuses as though they were granted as a motif. A target cannot benefit from an (arcana)'s bonuses more than once, and they do not stack (wands attached to two different motifs do not grant separate bonuses to initiative). In addition, when you cast a motif and attach an (arcana), you may spend an additional spell point to attach up to three (arcana) to that motif, instead of just one. When a motif with multiple attached (arcana) is discharged, each (arcana) talent's discharge effects occur simultaneously. If the same (arcana) is attached to one motif multiple times, that (arcana)'s bonuses do not stack and the discharge's duration and effects resolve cumulatively. Example:  A sphere caster with a Fate sphere caster level of 10 grants the target a motif with 3 attached wands. The target would gain +3 initiative as normal for the Wands talent when granted as a motif and no additional benefit for the two additional wands. A target who discharges an attached motif with three attached swords would ignore concealment for three minutes and receive three separate critical confirmation bonuses after the motif is discharged.

      "benefits": "You bend the forces of the cosmos to the heartbeat of mortality. Prerequisites:  Fate sphere; Death sphere or Life sphere; caster level 3rd. Benefits:  Whenever a Fate sphere effect you create would use an alignment, you may instead choose living or undead. Living and undead are considered opposite alignments that are 3 steps away from each other and do not have an alignment aura (such as determining additional penalties to the saving throw associated with the Enmity (word) talent or the Reveal Alignment (consecration) revealing whether the creatures inside are living or dead). You must possess the Death sphere to choose living or the Life sphere to choose undead. You may treat yourself as either living or undead when creating a consecration to exclude yourself from its effects (as you would normally be your own alignment and unaffected). In addition, whenever you use the Serendipity consecration, you may modify it with one of the following: Living Bastion (requires Life sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to sacred and only grants bonuses to living creatures (or penalizes undead creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any living creature healed by a magical effect inside this consecration heals up to an additional +1 hit point per Hit Dice they possess (to a maximum of the original amount healed). \n Unliving Bastion (requires Death sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to profane and only grants bonuses to undead (or penalizes living creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any undead created inside this consecration gains an additional +1 hit points per Hit Dice they possess. Sphere effects modified with this feat are still treated as the original talent for all purposes, and as such, do not stack with those same talents unmodified by this feat. This prevents a character from benefiting from both the Hallow (word) against evil and the Hallow (word) against undead, as modified by this feat, against the same target or effect. Likewise, a regular Serendipity consecration and the Living Bastion-modified Serendipity consecration's effects would not stack, despite granting different bonus types. Note:  For the purposes of this feat, a living creature is any creature with a Constitution score. Example:  A Fate sphere caster uses the Divine Force (consecration) talent. Instead of using the Fate sphere caster's alignment, the caster chooses living and affects any undead, regardless of their alignment, and does not affect living creatures. That same caster uses the Enmity (word) talent, choosing undead and targeting a living creature. The living creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or be blinded as though their alignment were 3 steps away from the caster's."

GM Advice Rules Clarifications and Expansions Descriptors Unlike spells, talents in various Spheres of Power releases mostly lack descriptor tags. While in most cases the appropriate tag can be inferred for a given talent or entire sphere, for several options it is helpful to explicitly specify which talents bear the curse descriptor. Death Curse (ghost strike) Fate Curse (word) \n Geas \n Harm (word) \n Mark of Judgment \n Mercy (word) \n Pain (word) \n Serendipity (consecration), when used with Greater Serendipity \n Truth (word) Alignment and Spheres of Power Unlike the core magic system, Spheres of Power mostly avoids associating alignment with magic\u2014Fate, the sphere that actually has alignment as a core theme, being the notable exception. The reanimate ability of the Death sphere is not given the evil descriptor like animate undead, nor is applying the hallow word to protect against evil creatures good like protection from evil even though you must be good to do so. This is intentional. Spheres of Power was designed to be setting-agnostic, allowing GMs to have the magic in their game fit the feel of their world. Undead are not evil in all possible settings and in some warding against evil is more prudent than good. It is simple enough for a GM to add alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power, or to allow special abilities like the touch of evil granted power from the evil domain to function with sphere abilities as if they had alignment descriptors. They are most easily applied to alignment- dependent talents in Fate, the reanimate ability of the Death sphere (which would be evil in most settings), and the Summoning advanced talent of the Conjuration sphere (which would have the alignment descriptors, and possibly the elemental descriptors, of whatever is called). Certain rituals and incantations would also have an alignment descriptor\u2014it is hard to justify Ragnarok as anything but evil, for instance, and any ritual duplicating a spell with an alignment descriptor should probably also have that descriptor. If a GM wishes a game in which alignment plays a more key role in magic, they also could add the good descriptor to all Life talents, evil to all Death talents, and chaos to all Destruction talents. In a setting where tampering with the mind is inherently evil, the Mind sphere could have the evil descriptor. And, of course, the GM could mix and match any or all of these suggestions to fit the setting. One other concern a GM ought to decide if adding alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power is to determine exactly how severe an evil act it is to use an evil talent and how great a good act it is to use a good talent. Does creating a zombie instantly change your alignment? Does it take a few castings? Or is it readily counteracted by using the zombie to rescue orphans and defeat demons? Different GMs have different opinions on this, and even different source books have offered different answers. Because of this, players may come into a game with very different expectations. It isn't fun for most players to suddenly become evil because of a single act when you weren't expecting it, so, like many rules interpretations, it's usually a good idea to discuss your decision with your players before it comes up. Other rule systems Removing Alignment Alignment is a foundational rule of Pathfinder, with many spells and abilities dependent on it. Even Spheres of Power, which makes minimal assumptions about alignment, uses it extensively in the Fate sphere and some feats. Pathfinder Unchained offers options, however, for excising alignment from the game and replacing it with loyalties. In a campaign using these rules, several adjustments to Spheres of Power should be made. Affected classes Ordained hunter (inquisitor archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Ordained hunters must have a loyalty to an alignment (or radiant or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The ordained hunter's empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms a critical hit against a creature whose loyalties are directly contrary to the ordained hunter's highest loyalty or reduces such an enemy to 0 hit points or lower. If using the subjective alignment variant, the ordained hunter is not required to have any particular loyalty and her empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms any critical hit or reduces any enemy to 0 hit points or lower. Utterdark Champion (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Utterdark champions must have a loyalty to evil (or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The utterdark champion's tenebrous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the utterdark champion's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the utterdark champion is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his tenebrous smite ability affects any creature caught in his area of darkness. The DR 10/ good granted by the unholy champion ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/radiant, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Warrior of Holy Light (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Warriors of holy light must have a loyalty to good (or radiance, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The warrior of holy light's luminous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the warrior of holy light's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the warrior of holy light is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his luminous smite ability affects any creature he attacks with his empowered weapon. The DR 10/evil granted by the warrior of the holy light ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/shadow, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Affected Feats Align Spell:  Replace with Fervent Spell, below. Anathema feats : The anathema ability affects any living or undead creature with loyalties opposed to your highest loyalty, even if positive energy would not normally damage the target."

      "benefits": "Benefit:  When you select this feat, choose two of your loyalties. When you prepare (if you are a prepared caster) or cast (if you are a spontaneous caster or spherecaster) an aligned spell, choose weal or woe. If you choose woe all variable, numeric effects of the spell are decreased by half (including bonuses to those dice rolls) for creatures sharing one of the chosen loyalties and increased by half (including bonuses to those dice rolls) for creatures with loyalties that directly contradict one of these loyalties (even if they share the other loyalty). If the spell does not have variable, numeric effects, it instead has its saving throw DC and effective spell level decreased by 2 against creatures sharing one of the selected loyalties and increased by 2 against creatures with loyalties that directly contradict one of these loyalties (even if they share the other loyalty). If you choose weal, these effects are reversed. The spells effects do not change for other creatures. Spells that neither do damage nor have a saving throw cannot be affected by Align Spell. Level Increase:  +2 Special:  You may take this feat more than once. Each time beyond the first you choose an additional loyalty you have. The effects of fervent spells are modified based on all loyalties chosen. If you lose a loyalty you chose for this feat, you may immediately choose a different loyalty you have to use it with. Alignment effects While removing alignment-based spells is suggested as an option in Pathfinder Unchained, removing alignment- based talents would make Fate much less attractive than other spheres. Instead, if you decide to remove alignment-based spells you should treat Fate talents as if you were using the subjective morality variant: Fate talents that affect an opposing alignment instead affect anyone with loyalties that directly contradict the caster's own. The talents Enmity and Metaphysical Cloak, because they interact with the default alignment system, should be removed in such a campaign. Hero Points Hero points represent the ability of true heroes to bend reality to their own story, to cheat fate, or to call in a debt from Lady Luck. In addition to the uses detailed in Advanced Player's Guide, spending a hero point may have one of the following effects: Empower:  You can spend a hero point to gain a +2 bonus to your caster level and MSD for one sphere effect or to your MSB for one magic skill check. Fuel:  You can spend a hero point in place of a spell point to power a sphere effect, class ability, or feat. Recover:  You can spend a hero point to regain a spent spell point, kismet point, shadow point, or hypnotism use. In addition, the following feat and talent may be made available in campaigns using hero points."

Additionally, any spells or effects the caster possesses that are dependent on alignment are inverted (smite evil becomes smite good, detect law becomes detect chaos, etc.). This alters all new and ongoing effects originating from the caster. Once this result expires, ongoing effects that were subject to this ability change back to their normal effect. \n \n \n 76 \n As an instantaneous effect, all valid targets within long range are affected by the Close (word) talent. \n \n \n 77 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all hostile creatures within close range of the caster gain an insight bonus to saving throws equal to one quarter caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 78 \n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, all allied creatures within close range of the caster must roll twice and take the best result for all d20 rolls. \n \n \n 79 \n For 1 round per caster level, all creatures within close range of the caster gain alignment auras opposite to their own alignment (neutral characters instead gain auras corresponding to a random extreme alignment) and count as that alignment or alignments for the purposes of spells and effects.

Evil=red, good=green, lawful=blue, chaotic= yellow. Creatures with mixed alignment produce bands of both colors. True neutral creatures darken instead of glow. \n \n \n 82 \n The caster takes untyped nonlethal damage equal to caster level. This damage does not force concentration checks to cast or maintain sphere effects or spells. \n \n \n 83 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster lose the benefit of all circumstance, competence, dodge, insight, luck, resistance, and sacred bonuses to d20 rolls and may ignore all penalties to d20 rolls. \n \n \n 84 \n The first time the caster rolls a d20 after his next initiative roll, he may choose the result.

Spell points or spell slots are lost. \n \n \n 96 \n For 1 hour, all sacred and profane bonuses within close range of the caster are instead treated as penalties. \n \n \n 97 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 98 \n All creatures within close range of the caster may choose to treat one d20 roll within the next 1d6 rounds as a natural 20. \n \n \n 99 \n (Combat) For 1d6 rounds, any 20 rolled on a d20 within close range of the caster is treated as having rolled a natural 1. \n \n \n 100 \n For 1 hour, all luck bonuses within close range of the caster are instead treated as penalties. GM Advice Rules Clarifications and Expansions Descriptors Unlike spells, talents in various Spheres of Power releases mostly lack descriptor tags. While in most cases the appropriate tag can be inferred for a given talent or entire sphere, for several options it is helpful to explicitly specify which talents bear the curse descriptor. Death Curse (ghost strike) Destruction Branding Taboo (blast shape) Fate Curse (word) \n Geas \n Harm (word) \n Mark of Judgment \n Mercy (word) \n Pain (word) \n Serendipity (consecration), when used with Greater Serendipity \n Truth (word) Alignment and Spheres of Power Unlike the core magic system, Spheres of Power mostly avoids associating alignment with magic\u2014Fate, the sphere that actually has alignment as a core theme, being the notable exception. The reanimate ability of the Death sphere is not given the evil descriptor like animate undead, nor is applying the hallow word to protect against evil creatures good like protection from evil even though you must be good to do so. This is intentional. Spheres of Power was designed to be setting-agnostic, allowing GMs to have the magic in their game fit the feel of their world. Undead are not evil in all possible settings and in some warding against evil is more prudent than good. It is simple enough for a GM to add alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power, or to allow special abilities like the touch of evil granted power from the evil domain to function with sphere abilities as if they had alignment descriptors. They are most easily applied to alignment- dependent talents in Fate, the reanimate ability of the Death sphere (which would be evil in most settings), and the Summoning advanced talent of the Conjuration sphere (which would have the alignment descriptors, and possibly the elemental descriptors, of whatever is called). Certain rituals and incantations would also have an alignment descriptor\u2014it is hard to justify Ragnarok as anything but evil, for instance, and any ritual duplicating a spell with an alignment descriptor should probably also have that descriptor. If a GM wishes a game in which alignment plays a more key role in magic, they also could add the good descriptor to all Life talents, evil to all Death talents, and chaos to all Destruction talents. In a setting where tampering with the mind is inherently evil, the Mind sphere could have the evil descriptor. And, of course, the GM could mix and match any or all of these suggestions to fit the setting. One other concern a GM ought to decide if adding alignment descriptors to Spheres of Power is to determine exactly how severe an evil act it is to use an evil talent and how great a good act it is to use a good talent. Does creating a zombie instantly change your alignment? Does it take a few castings? Or is it readily counteracted by using the zombie to rescue orphans and defeat demons? Different GMs have different opinions on this, and even different source books have offered different answers. Because of this, players may come into a game with very different expectations. It isn't fun for most players to suddenly become evil because of a single act when you weren't expecting it, so, like many rules interpretations, it's usually a good idea to discuss your decision with your players before it comes up. Other rule systems Removing Alignment Alignment is a foundational rule of Pathfinder, with many spells and abilities dependent on it. Even Spheres of Power, which makes minimal assumptions about alignment, uses it extensively in the Fate sphere and some feats. Pathfinder Unchained offers options, however, for excising alignment from the game and replacing it with loyalties. In a campaign using these rules, several adjustments to Spheres of Power should be made. Affected classes Ordained hunter (inquisitor archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Ordained hunters must have a loyalty to an alignment (or radiant or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The ordained hunter's empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms a critical hit against a creature whose loyalties are directly contrary to the ordained hunter's highest loyalty or reduces such an enemy to 0 hit points or lower. If using the subjective alignment variant, the ordained hunter is not required to have any particular loyalty and her empyreal tongue deed can be used whenever an ally confirms any critical hit or reduces any enemy to 0 hit points or lower. Utterdark Champion (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Utterdark champions must have a loyalty to evil (or shadow, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The utterdark champion's tenebrous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the utterdark champion's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the utterdark champion is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his tenebrous smite ability affects any creature caught in his area of darkness. The DR 10/ good granted by the unholy champion ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/radiant, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Warrior of Holy Light (mageknight archetype):  Remove the alignment requirement. Warriors of holy light must have a loyalty to good (or radiance, if using the radiant and shadow variant). The warrior of holy light's luminous smite ability affects creatures whose loyalties are directly contrary to the warrior of holy light's highest loyalty. If using the subjective alignment variant, the warrior of holy light is not required to to have any particular loyalty and his luminous smite ability affects any creature he attacks with his empowered weapon. The DR 10/evil granted by the warrior of the holy light ability should be changed to another appropriate type of damage reduction, such as DR 10/shadow, DR 10/cold iron, or DR 10/silver. Affected Feats Align Spell:  Replace with Fervent Spell, below. Anathema feats : The anathema ability affects any living or undead creature with loyalties opposed to your highest loyalty, even if positive energy would not normally damage the target."

      "benefits": "The Auspician's Handbook \n$4.99 You may spend a spell point to hallow a target for 1 minute per caster level. Choose an end of the alignment spectrum (good, evil, lawful, chaotic); you must choose an alignment that you possess. The target of this word gains a +1 sacred bonus (profane bonus if you are evil; if you are neither good nor evil you must choose whether you grant sacred or profane bonuses with this sphere) to attack rolls, AC, and saving throws made against targets of your opposed alignment (evil for good, lawful for chaotic, etc.). This bonus increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels possessed. The target also gains immunity to any spell or sphere effect that possesses or exercises mental control over them (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects), so long as that effect originates from a creature who possesses your opposed alignment. If the target is already under the influence of such an effect, the target is allowed to make a new saving throw against the controlling effect. Success means the effect is suppressed for the duration of this word, but resumes when this word expires. This does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or projected spirit), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. Some Fate talents are marked (word). These talents grant you additional words. Consecration [Core] As a standard action, you may affect a 20 ft radius centered on you with a consecration. This aura moves as you do.

This bonus lasts as long as you concentrate. You may spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration. This is only a curse effect when used with Greater Serendipity. Fate talents marked (consecration) grant you additional consecrations. Motifs Less precise than divination, but more proactive, (motif) talents give an auspician a glimpse at the pattern of Fate's tapestry and allow her to nudge one or two threads in a direction she chooses. Unless otherwise noted, a talent with the (motif) tag is cast as a standard action on a target with a range of touch and costs one spell point. A successful Will save negates the effect. While they normally have a duration of 1 hour per level, the target can also discharge a (motif) talent as an immediate action to gain an instantaneous or short-lived benefit, after which the effect ends.

    "enmity (word, curse)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point as a standard action to place a word on a target debilitating them more severely the less similar their outlook on life is to yours. The effect of this word depends on the number of steps away its alignment is from your own. A target with the same alignment as you is unaffected, while all others are affected as follows: Table: Enmity Steps \n Effect \n \n \n 1 \n Sickened one minute \n \n \n 2 \n Staggered one round \n \n \n 3 \n Blind one round \n \n \n 4 \n Dazed one round These effects are cumulative and consecutive; for example, if a chaotic evil creature were affected by an enmity word produced by a lawful good creature, it would be dazed for one round, then blind for one round, then staggered for one round, and finally sickened for one minute. As this power is cosmic in origin, it can affect undead, even though undead are usually immune to some of these conditions. A successful Will save negates this effect, but targets with an especially strong alignment aura opposing your alignment (such as chaotic or good for a lawful evil caster) take a penalty to their save: strong, -1; overwhelming, -2. If a target has multiple alignment auras, the penalty is determined by the strongest one."

Once per round when the attacker deals damage to or succeeds on a combat maneuver check against the victim the attacker gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. This bonus increases by +1 for every 10 caster levels. Multiple bonuses from a single instance of this word stack with each other, up to your casting ability modifier, but not from other instances of the same word.

The next time it is used to make an attack, the attack automatically hits the wielder. This word itself does not obviously modify the weapon, so unless alerted by other means (such as detect magic or the divine use of the Divination sphere) the wielder cannot attempt to deal nonlethal damage. At 10th level, the attack automatically threatens a critical hit. An attended or magic weapon is entitled to a Will saving throw to negate this effect. This curse remains up to 1 hour per caster level or until discharged."

    "villainy (word, curse)": {
      "benefits": "You may place this word on a creature marking them as a villain regardless of their actual role in fate's story. A successful Will save negates this effect.

When this word's effect ends, so does the effect of these abilities. You may also, as a free action even when it isn't your turn, spend a spell point to allow an ally to use such an effect without spending a daily use or to give an ally without one of these abilities or who choose not to use that ability a +1 bonus to attack and weapon damage rolls against the target of this word. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 caster levels.

    "illusionary disguise": {
      "benefits": "You may create a glamer that makes a creature or object appear as something else. This allows you to attempt a Disguise check as part of casting the glamer, even without a disguise kit. This disguise is magical for the purposes of detecting magic or for spells and effects that allow a target to see through magical effects and illusions, and interacting with it allows for a Will save to disbelieve. You may disguise a target as something larger than itself (up to your maximum illusion size) but can only make something appear to be one size smaller than it actually is. Special Considerations Disbelief and Interaction:  When a creature interacts with an illusion, they may attempt a Will save to disbelieve. Generally speaking, simply observing an illusion is not enough; in order to 'interact' with an illusion a creature may spend a move action to carefully study the illusion. Additionally, any action that requires at least a move action and similarly engages directly with the illusion counts as interaction. For example, if there were a figment of a dragon, a character who tried to attack the dragon would receive a saving throw to disbelieve, as would a character who spent 1 minute attempting a Diplomacy check on the dragon. A character who just traded witty banter with the dragon as a free action would not, nor would a character who simply cast spells on herself or her allies and never directly confronted the illusory dragon. For a glamer, interacting generally works the same as for a figment, except that the interaction must be limited to something the glamer affects. For instance, grabbing a creature's ear would be an interaction for a human using disguise self to appear as an elf, but not for someone using a glamer to change their hair color. Similarly, visually studying someone would not grant a save against a glamer that purely changed their voice. Additionally, if you or a creature who has made their saving throw against one of your illusions declares that the illusion is, indeed, an illusion, other creatures so informed gain an automatic saving throw against the illusion. While multiple declarations from multiple creatures can produce multiple saving throws, only one saving throw can be generated per illusion by any single creature; if a declaration was unconvincing, the same person simply insisting again is not helpful. Sustained Disbelief:  Allies do not automatically disbelieve your illusions, but if they have been informed about and are familiar with your particular artistry and illusion style they gain a +5 circumstance bonus to all saves made to disbelieve your illusions. You may suppress this bonus by changing your personal style if you so desire. Creatures who successfully identify a sphere effect as belonging to the Illusion sphere as it is being cast, such as with a Spellcraft check or detect magic spell (or similar ability), also gain this +5 circumstance bonus to any Will saves made to disbelieve that illusion. If the GM feels it is appropriate, a creature who has interacted with multiple illusions in a day (especially if they have come from the same illusionist), might gain this bonus as well, to reflect how they are looking for patterns and checking and double-checking everything in front of them to avoid being fooled 'again'. This bonus would not apply when taking 10, taking 20, and would disallow checking a location multiple times in a row; double-checking is reflected in the bonus. Multiple Senses:  By default, the only sense that can be affected by a basic illusion is sight. However, certain talents marked with (sensory) allow the caster to create illusions that also produce illusionary sound, taste, smell, or even touch. The more complex an illusion is, the more talents it requires to be convincing, with the chart below serving as a guideline and the GM serving as the final arbiter for what talents are required to create a specific illusion. Creating an illusion without the necessary (sensory) talents often leads to disbelief; whenever a creature interacts with an illusion in a way that requires a (sensory) talent it does not possess, they may attempt a Will save to disbelieve with a +5 bonus. This bonus is cumulative for each missing (sensory) talent. This is in addition to simply learning the sensory experience is not there (for example, if a creature walks through an illusionary wall they will learn they can pass through that wall whether or not they discover the reason why is that the wall is illusionary). If the GM deems it appropriate, certain other situations might allow a target to gain a similar +5 bonus to their Will saves (for example, a creature being damaged by illusionary 'fire' that is normally immune to fire damage). Table: Example Illusions Example of Illusion \n Additional Required Talents \n \n \n An illusionary wall \n Illusionary Touch (if felt) \n \n \n A glen full of trees \n Complex Illusion \n \n \n A warrior blocking the target's way \n Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch (to engage in combat with target) \n \n \n A table laden with food \n Illusionary Odor, Illusionary Touch (if consumed by target) \n \n \n A room filled with fire \n Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch \n \n \n An army of orcs chasing the target \n Complex Illusion, Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch (to engage in combat with target) Cover and Concealment:  Figments and glamers provide concealment if they block line of sight. A figment of a wall, for example, would grant total concealment unless the attacker disbelieved the illusion, whereas a figment of fog would only grant partial concealment. Glamers that are used to change the size of a creature to appear larger than it is grants a 10% miss chance for each size increase due to concealment. If a creature is glamered to appear larger and its larger size would provide a cover bonus to another target, it instead grants this same concealment bonus to miss chance. Glamers and figments with the shadow descriptor which grant a miss chance or concealment also grant soft cover. Illusionary Creatures:  If creating an illusionary creature, your illusion has an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and an AC and touch AC equal to 10 + its size modifier + 1/2 your caster level + your casting ability modifier. An illusionary creature may provide a flanking bonus against targets who fail to disbelieve it. Any creature who strikes an illusionary creature in combat (unless augmented by Illusionary Touch) receives the standard +5 circumstance bonus to disbelieve it, and any creature struck by the illusionary creature receives the same bonus (unless augmented by Illusionary Touch 2x). All actions that an illusionary creature performs must be contained within the figment of the illusion that created it, regardless of the size of the illusionary creature itself. Powerful Senses:  Senses such as see in darkness, x-ray vision, mistsight, or greensight that are designed to penetrate specific sorts of occlusion or display vision differently do not automatically interact with illusions the way they do unaltered reality, and thus tricking a character with such a sense is a difficult task, but not impossible. For example, when creating an illusionary wall to fool a creature with x-ray vision, one could create an illusion that 'looks' like a wall being looked through with x-ray vision. However, creating an illusion that would trick such senses can create obvious signs of trickery with those that do not possess that sight (for example, the illusion of a forest would look suspicious to a character with greensight if he could not see through it, but making the illusionary forest transparent would look suspicious to any of their allies who do not possess greensight). The Selective Illusions talent can be helpful in overcoming this problem in certain situations. Complex and Exotic Senses:  Illusions can foil all forms of perception, even unusual forms that a creature might possess. Use the following list when dealing with unusual senses. Blindsense:  Illusionary Odor and Illusionary Sound \n Blindsight:  Illusionary Odor, Illusionary Sound, and Illusionary Touch \n Detect Magic:  Manipulate Aura \n Echolocation:  Illusionary Sound through air, Illusionary Touch through water \n Scent or Keen Scent:  Illusionary Odor \n Lifesense:  Manipulate Aura, Illusionary Touch \n Thoughtsense or Detect Thoughts:  Implausible Deniability feat \n Tremorsense:  Illusionary Touch For figments, if you do not possess all of the indicated (sensory) talents required to convincingly create the illusion, creatures with that sense are automatically treated as interacting with your figment the first time the figment comes within range of that sense, and any Will save made to disbelieve the figment while within range of that sense is made with the standard +5 circumstance bonus for each missing talent. For glamers, every sensory talent you lack to fool the listed sense causes the creature affected by that glamer to suffer a -2 penalty to any skill bonus or Disguise check granted by that glamer vs. that creature, and reduces any miss chance granted by the glamer by 10%. If the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature may ignore all other effects of the glamer. For Suppressions, if all senses that make up the complex sense are suppressed by the effect, the complex sense fails to penetrate that area. Trick As a standard action, you may create small, simple illusions called tricks. Unless otherwise stated, a trick persists for 1 minute per level or until dismissed."

      "benefits": "You may create unconvincing figments. This is the same as creating an illusion and can include all senses you can affect through (sense) talents, except it is obviously fake (i.e., it is translucent, unrealistic, etc.), requiring no one to attempt a Will save to disbelieve. However, the effects can still be used to create distractions, display images, draw a map, or be used for entertainment.

This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack.

    "blur (glamer)": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may designate a single 5-foot cube as a figment that distorts perception. This distortion lasts for one round per caster level. Any effect originating from a source whose line of sight begins inside or crosses this area incurs a 20% miss chance + 5% per caster level (maximum 50%) due to concealment. Any creature may attempt a Will save as a free action once per round to ignore this miss chance for 1 round. You may only have one such disruption at a time. Using this trick a second time immediately end the duration of the previous casting of this trick. As an illusion you may create a distorting figment. This creates a figment that causes a distortion as described above. As an illusion you may create a distorting glamer. This functions in all other ways as the trick except it does not allow for a Will save to ignore the miss chance and has the duration of a standard illusion. As a glamer, the miss chance only applies to attacks made against the target. Author's Note:  Blurs created with this talent do not need to be visual, or purely visual; They can incorporate elements that distort other forms of perception based upon what (sensory) talents you possess. A creature can ignore the miss chance granted by blur if they lack senses for every (sensory) effect you incorporate into the effect; A purely visual blur can have its miss chance ignored by a creature that closes its eyes. To determine if a sense is sufficiently possessed by a creature when determining if they can ignore the miss chance provided by the blur effect, they must be capable of pin-pointing the space of a creature only using that sense; For example, humans do not normally qualify as possessing the necessary senses to pin-point a creature by smell or taste alone (unless they gain other senses such as scent, keen scent, or some forms of blindsense)."

    "complex illusion [mass]": {
      "benefits": "When creating a figment, you may spend an additional spell point to divide the figment into multiple, independent components. The combined size and range of these figments must still be within your maximum illusion size, but each component can appear differently and behave differently. While each component can be given its own set of programmed instructions, you can only actively control one component at a time. For example, when creating an illusion of a tavern, a creature with this talent could create a bustling group of people inside the tavern as part of the same illusion. The caster could only control one such illusionary person at a time though; and the rest would only perform their last set of instructions. Giving a component a new set of instructions is a move action. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a complex illusion, it sees through the entire figment rather than only one component part. When creating glamers, you may spend an additional spell point to affect multiple different targets with the same glamer so long as they are all within your illusion range and the combined size of affected targets does not exceed your maximum illusion size. For example, if your maximum illusion size is Large, you could affect with this talent 2 Medium-sized targets or 4 Small-sized targets with your glamer. Once created, each glamer is considered a separate sphere effect."

      "benefits": "As a trick you may create an illusionary creature in the same square as a real creature, called a decoy. A decoy may perform any of the following actions. Coaxing Decoy:  The decoy immediately moves up to the speed of your figments in any direction unimpeded. The coaxing decoy is immune to damage and vanishes at the end of your turn. If the movement of the coaxing decoy would provoke an attack of opportunity from a creature, that creature must succeed at a Will save or use it on the coaxing decoy. Defensive Decoy:  The decoy follows and occupies the same square as the target. Anyone attempting to attack the target must succeed at a Will save or suffer a 50% miss chance. On a miss caused by this effect the attacker targets the illusionary creature instead, dissipating it. The decoy is unaffected by area attacks. Defensive decoys last 1 round per two caster levels (minimum 1) or until struck with a single target effect. Additionally, as an illusion you may create a glamer that surrounds a target with a number of defensive decoys equal to 2 +1 per 3 caster levels. As long as one or more defensive decoys remain, the target gains a 50% miss chance. If you possess the Complex Illusions talent, one or more of the defensive decoys granted by the glamer may act as the coaxing decoy trick. Once per round as a free action you may instruct one or more decoys to move up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels independently of the original target, provoking attacks of opportunity as a coaxing decoy, then disappearing."

    "focused imagination": {
      "benefits": "When you create an illusion, you may maintain it through concentration for 10 minutes per caster level. If you also possess the Lingering Illusion talent, when you spend an additional spell point to allow your illusions to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration, it instead remains for 10 minutes per caster level."

    "greater illusionary disguise": {
      "benefits": "When creating an Illusionary Disguise, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Disguise check, +2 per (sensory) talent you possess (other than Manipulate Aura, which does not affect the normal senses)."
    },
    "hostile glamers (glamer)": {
      "benefits": "Targets of your glamers do not automatically ignore their effects as normal unless you allow them to. Additionally you may roll related skill checks on behalf of any unwilling targets that failed their saving throw against your glamer. The target is treated as if they made the check regardless of their desire to for the duration of the effect. Unwilling targets affected by this talent are not automatically aware of the glamer (as normal) unless you allow them to be or if the glamer physically hampers or harms them. Affected targets interact with any glamer attached to them as if it was a figment occupying the same space. When combined with the decoy talent, the decoys acts as flanking partners and attempts to position accordingly at the end of the original creature's turn. Attacks against the decoy by anyone other than the original creature have a 50% chance to instead hit the original. If you also possess Distracting Phantoms, so long as at least one copy remains the original creature can be flanked without the need of a flanking partner and attack rolls against them gain a +1 circumstance bonus per copy."
    },
    "illusionary labyrinth": {
      "benefits": "As a trick, you may choose to perform a reposition maneuver on any target within your illusion range using your (caster level + your casting modifier -5) in place of your CMB. When creating a figment you may spend an additional spell point to require anyone that has failed to disbelieve the effect to succeed at an additional Will save when attempting to move from or through the area of your figment or immediately end their movement and remain in the first space occupied by the figment that they also occupied."
    },
    "illusionary terrain": {
      "benefits": "As a trick, you may designate a single cube (no larger than your maximum illusion size) as difficult terrain for one round per caster level. A Will save to disbelieve is allowed by all who enter the cube. On a successful save they treat the area as normal. This difficult terrain applies to all travel through the area regardless of type of movement. You may treat the area of your figments as difficult terrain regardless of the type of movement for those who fail to disbelieve."
    },
    "insistent illusions": {
      "benefits": "As a swift action, you may spend 2 spell points to force all creatures that currently disbelieve any of your figments to re-roll their Will saves to disbelieve. Failure indicates that they believe the illusion is real regardless of the results of previous Will saves."
    },
    "inspire doubt": {
      "benefits": "You may combine real effects and illusionary effects to effectively confuse targets as to which are real and which are not. Anyone who successfully saves against your figments takes a -1 penalty to all saving throws and MSD against your other non-Illusion sphere effects and abilities for the next minute or until they attempt a save against one of your non-Illusion sphere effects. This penalty increases by an additional one per 5 caster levels you possess."
    },
    "instill glamer [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill a glamer inside it, which functions as a potion or oil. The glamer cannot have a duration of concentration, and cannot be augmented by Committed Deception. You must spend an additional spell point to instill a trick. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "lingering illusion": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to allow the illusion to remain for 1 minute per caster level without the need for concentration. When a figment is not maintained through concentration, it performs whatever set of actions it was last commanded to do, and cannot move beyond medium range of where it was placed. Giving a figment a new series of programmed activities is a move action."
    },
    "mage feint": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may aid another on any target within your illusion range with attack or defense. As a trick you may force a target to make a Will save or lose their Dexterity bonus to armor class until their turn. This trick is treated as a feint for feats, talents, and effects that trigger off of a feint. As a trick you may create a harmless sensory disruption around a target. The target must make a Will save or this triggers any readied actions the target may have regardless of their actual trigger. You may spend a spell point to use any of these tricks as a swift action."
    },
    "masques (glamer)": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you take this talent select two of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform. As a trick, you may aid another on any target within your illusion range with the selected skills. As a glamer, you may grant an enhancement bonus to skill checks with the selected skills equal to half your caster level. This talent may be taken twice to allow it to work with all 4 skills. You may use this glamer as part of the action required to cast Illusionary Disguise at no additional cost. When added to an illusionary disguise in this way, the duration ends when the illusionary disguise expires. If you possess the Hostile Glamers talent, you may create glamers that grant a penalty instead of a bonus to the selected skills."
    },
    "novel deception [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may pretend to cast an Illusion sphere effect and attempt a Bluff check. Making a Bluff check in this manner does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as casting a spell. Any creature observing you must attempt a Sense Motive or Spellcraft check (whichever skill that target has a higher bonus with) against a DC equal to your Bluff check or be convinced you cast an illusion. For the next 10 minutes, the next time a creature who failed its check would make a saving throw against one of your illusions, they must roll twice and take the lower result. For every 8 caster levels you possess, creatures must roll twice on an additional saving throw against your illusions during this duration. Creatures who succeed at their check know you were bluffing and are unaffected. This is an extraordinary effect; you can only attempt to deceive the same creature with this talent once every 24 hours. Note:  If it would be impossible for the caster to cast magic, such as while in an anti-magic field, creatures automatically succeed their Sense Motive or Spellcraft check to see through your deception."
    },
    "oblivious": {
      "benefits": "When applying a glamer to a target, you may choose to do so subtly, such that they might not even realize they have been affected by one. If the target fails their saving throw against the glamer, they must attempt an additional Will saving throw. On a failure they do not realize they have been glamered. Glamers that damage or impede the target (for example, lighting someone on fire with a hostile glamer) cannot be done subtly in this fashion."
    },
    "overwhelming sensations": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may force a target to make a Will save or suffer extreme sensation for one round per two caster levels (minimum 1). Select one of the following effects based on what sensory talents you possess. Sense \n Effect \n \n \n Magic \n Treat your caster level as 5 higher when creating, but not concealing or modifying, auras using the Manipulate Aura trick. \n \n \n Odor \n Sickened \n \n \n Sight \n Dazzled, this becomes staggered for 1 round if the target is already dazzled. \n \n \n Sound \n Shaken, this becomes frightened for 1 round if the target is already shaken. \n \n \n Touch \n Fatigued"
    },
    "patterns": {

    },
    "programmed illusion": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you create an illusion, you may add a specific circumstance that, when met, changes the nature of the illusion immediately. You may create an additional circumstance per 5 caster levels. For example, you could create an illusion that only activates when a humanoid comes within 10 ft. of it, at which point it becomes a high pitched siren and flashing bright lights."

    "ranged illusion [range]": {
      "benefits": "Increase the distance by which you may manifest an illusion or trick by one category (close to medium, medium to long). You may take this talent multiple times. The effects stack."
    },
    "selective illusions": {
      "benefits": "By spending an additional spell point at the time you create an illusion, you may designate any number of targets to automatically disbelieve that illusion. Once per round per illusion as a free action, you may allow any number of targets to be treated as automatically disbelieving the illusion or completely suppress the effect without ending it (but must still concentrate if the effect is being maintained via concentration). Example 1:  When under the effects of Invisibility or Illusionary Disguise, you may allow your allies to see you as if you had no concealment or disguise while still maintaining the effect against everyone else. Example 2:  For a single round, you may suppress your Silence talent on an enemy to make them vulnerable to a sound based attack, then resume the silence effect the following round. Anyone you designate as unaffected is still aware of the effect just as if they had disbelieved it, allowing them to appropriately react in the case of a ruse or the need to make tactical decisions. Illusions that have effects regardless of belief or disbelief, such as Silence or Shadow Infusion, still have those effects unless you opt to suppress them. Suppressing and reactivating an illusion does not force those whom already successfully disbelieved the illusion to re-roll their saves."
    },
    "shadow infusion": {
      "benefits": "When using an Illusion sphere effect you may spend an additional spell point to render the illusion quasi-real, granting it the shadow descriptor. If you have a shadow pool you may use a shadow point instead of a spell point. Illusions that you grant the (shadow) descriptor to with the Shadow Infusion talent are modified in the following ways: If you possess Illusionary Touch x2, you may transform the damage dealt by the illusion to either acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, electricity, piercing, or slashing (chosen when the illusion is created but can be altered with the illusion), and may make it either lethal or nonlethal. If you also possess Illusionary Sound you may create shadow effects that deal sonic damage. If you also possess Manipulate Aura you may spend an additional spell point each round to create shadow effects that deal force, positive energy, or negative energy damage. If an illusion would have a negated effect if disbelieved, a shadow version of that illusion instead has its effectiveness reduced by half (rounded down). For saving throws, this changes the saves to Fort (partial) or Will (partial) instead of Fort (negates) or Will (negates) as applicable. Creatures with the Stalwart ability (or similar) features may choose to treat shadow illusions as normal illusions upon successfully disbelieving the illusion."

    "shift glamers": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may move any number of your glamers still within your maximum illusion range to new targets also within your maximum illusion range."
    },
    "suppression (glamer)": {
      "benefits": "As an illusion, you may create glamers that suppress and eliminate sensation rather than creating their own. Suppressions cannot be negated or disbelieved through a Will save. You may suppress any sense that you can affect when creating illusions, but each such Suppression is considered a separate glamer. Note:  If you suppress every sense required to fool a complex or exotic sense, that sense cannot automatically detect that creature. Invisibility:  When suppressing vision, you allow the target to attempt Stealth checks to hide even while being observed. This does not grant the invisible condition, but counts as invisibility for effects that interact with it (such as spells that negate it), and therefore does not stack with the invisibility spell or other, similar effects. The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks per caster level (maximum 20). Objects cannot attempt Stealth checks, but become difficult to see, requiring a Perception check to find with a DC equal to 10 + their size bonus + your caster level. If you are undetected by a creature, you gain total concealment against it, as well as a +2 bonus to attack rolls against it, and you may ignore its Dexterity bonus to AC. Silence:  When suppressing sound, you cause the creature to become muffled. The target loses its armor check penalty to Stealth and reduces the penalty associated with sniping by 1 per caster level (minimum 0). However, the target also suffers a 5% chance of arcane spell failure per caster level (maximum 100%) when using magic that requires verbal components or is language-based. Touchless:  When suppressing touch, it becomes difficult to detect the target by feel. If the target touches or makes a melee attack against a creature from Stealth, that creature must succeed at a Perception check to even feel that they have been touched or attacked (DC 10 + 1 per caster level, -1 per point of damage dealt). The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus per caster level (maximum +20) to Sleight of Hand checks made to pick pockets. Odorless:  When suppressing taste and smell, the affected target inflicts other creatures attempting to track it or discover it through smell (such as with the scent special ability) a penalty to their Perception or Survival checks equal to -1 per caster level (maximum 20). This also applies to checks made to detect poison or identify the target via smell or taste. Additionally, if the target attempts to use smell to affect other targets (such as making them sickened or nauseated through the stench ability), targets gain a +1 bonus per caster level (maximum 20) to their saving throws. Suppressing magical auras is described in the Manipulate Aura talent, and is assumed to be used on all magical auras (including the aura from the Suppression itself) affecting the glamered creature. You may spend an additional spell point to create a figment that suppresses sensations just like the glamer. All targets inside the figment gain the above benefits and penalties, as if they were under the effects of the glamer. You may choose if this applies only to creatures or to all creatures and objects. Unlike other figments, a Suppression figment cannot move once placed, and has no sensory expression other than the noticeable blurring of sensation inside its area."

    "swift figments": {
      "benefits": "The speed your figments may move within a single round improves to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. This talent may be taken twice. If taken a second time, the speed your figments may move within a single round improves to 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level."
    },
    "synesthesia": {
      "benefits": "As a trick, you can link two senses allowing you to, for example, see sound or smell color. You become dazed until the end of your next turn and gain a complex sense you can fool with your illusions and until the end of your next turn. The range of this sense is limited to 5 ft. per 2 caster levels (minimum 5 ft.). If you possess Amplify Senses, improve the range of the sense to 5 ft. per caster level. If you possess Overwhelming Sensation, you may improve the range of the sense by an additional 5 ft. per caster level but become deafened and blinded instead of dazed."

    "windtalker": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may use your illusions to signal or communicate. This functions as the deliver secret message use of the Bluff skill but you gain a 5 + caster level circumstance bonus to the Bluff check and can do so within your maximum illusion range without penalty. The recipients must still interact with the illusion in some way to get the intended message. This communication only works one way but is not language dependant and may rely on any sense or complex sense the intended recipients possess. If you possess Selective Illusions, there is no chance of the message being intercepted. Figment Talents"

    "illusionary odor (sensory, taste & smell)": {
      "benefits": "You may add smell and taste to your illusions. For example, you may change something's taste or create the smell of smoke. As a trick, you may add half your caster level to the DC required to detect poison in foods or to track a target by smell."
    },
    "illusionary sound (sensory, sound)": {
      "benefits": "You may add whatever sounds you desire to an illusion. You cannot make more sound than four normal humans per caster level could make. (A horde of rats running and squeaking is equal to eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.) As a trick, you may create effects of non-specific noises (feet marching, laughing and muttering of a party) or throw your voice, making it appear as if it comes from somewhere else within your range. Targets are allowed a Will save as usual to disbelieve these sounds, or recognize your voice is not actually coming from where it appears to be."
    },
    "illusionary touch (sensory, touch)": {
      "benefits": "You may make an illusion that feels real to the touch, including temperature and texture. Your illusion still cannot hold weight (thus while touching the wall would only grant a new saving throw, being thrown into the wall would still cause the creature to pass through). You may take this talent a total of twice; when taken a second time, your illusions may also cause pain. When coming into contact with an appropriate illusion (stepping into fire, being hit by an illusionary enemy, etc.), if the subject fails their Will save to disbelieve they take nonlethal damage equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier. A target can only be damaged by your illusions once in a round, no matter how many times it thinks the illusion has hurt it."
    },
    "manipulate aura (sensory, magic)": {
      "benefits": "You may make illusions that create or change magical auras. As a figment or glamer you may change an area, spell, creature, or object's magical aura to make the aura appear as a magic effect or item you specify, or as if under the effects of a spell or sphere ability you specify, or reduce the caster level of its existent aura. You cannot create or lower an aura's perceived caster level more than up to twice your caster level. Making an aura appear to have a caster level of 0 completely conceals a magical aura as if the target was non-magical. You may make these changes as part of creating an illusion (including altering or erasing the aura of the illusion itself), or independently as a trick with a duration of up to 1 day per caster level. As you create a figment or a glamer, you may apply this sensory talent to change what sphere of magic it belongs to for the purpose of people identifying the school of magic or sphere effect via the Spellcraft skill or detect magic (or similar spell or ability). For example, if you change the apparent sphere from Illusion to Destruction, any attempt to identify the sphere effect with the Spellcraft skill will reveal it as belonging to the Destruction sphere, not the Illusion sphere. Instead of 'disbelieving' a manipulated aura, a target examining this aura through detection magic must succeed at a magic skill check against the creator of the aura. If the check succeeds, the detection effect functions normally detecting both the true aura and this trick, but on a failure the detection magic believes the manipulated aura and does not detect this trick. Effects that grant bonuses to Will saves against illusions add those bonuses to this magic skill check. Artifacts are too powerful to have their auras hidden or altered in this manner. Advanced Illusion Talents Advanced talents are part of an optional rule and are only available with GM permission."

      "benefits": "Whenever you create an illusion, you may empower it to be incredibly difficult to perceive and disbelieve. Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Manipulate Aura (sensory, magic)), caster level 10th. Whenever a creature would disbelieve an illusion you have created and declare or inform other creatures that the illusion is an illusion, other creatures informed of the illusion's nature do not receive an automatic saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. In addition, if an effect would allow a creature to automatically disbelieve an illusion, that effect does not allow the creature to automatically see through or overcome the illusion (such as true seeing or the Divination sphere True Seeing (sense) advanced talent not automatically seeing through a visual illusion). The creature is instead automatically granted a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion as though they had properly interacted with the illusion. A creature benefiting from such an effect only receives a single, automatic saving throw to disbelieve for each illusion (such as only receiving a single, automatic saving throw against your illusion if observing it with true seeing, and must interact and disbelieve it normally should they fail their saving throw). Author's Note:  For the purposes of this ability, an \"effect\" is a spell, class feature, or ability that would automatically defeat an illusion \u2013 this is primarily the true seeing spell, but other effects could yield similar results by GM discretion. This talent is not meant to prevent a creature from becoming aware of the illusion through their own means. For example, being pushed through an illusory wall would tell the creature they could pass through the wall, and would grant a saving throw to disbelieve the wall as normal."

By spending an additional spell point, you no longer need to have line of sight or spend a standard action to direct, move, or alter your figments. This allows your figments to somewhat automatically adapt to situations without having to be given new orders or modifying appearances to fit the situation. Your illusions, when behaving autonomously, act and react more or less realistically depending upon your caster level. Use the following table as a guideline for what may at most be expected from an illusion acting independently. Table: Phantom Mind Illusion Realism CL \n Maximum Expected Realistic Effect \n \n \n 8-10 \n Simple communication (as a human toddler). \n \n \n 11-12 \n Decent problem solving, moderate communication (as a very young human). \n \n \n 13-14 \n Decent communication (as a young human). \n \n \n 15-16 \n Advanced problem solving and simple planning (as an adolescent human). \n \n \n 17-18 \n Advanced communication and moderate planning (as a dumb human). \n \n \n 19-20 \n Advanced planning (as an average human).

For example, when divining for alignment you may surround all creatures within your divine area with auras of light or floating signs indicating their alignment or may create an illusory replica of everything you can see when using viewing. These illusions last for the duration of the divine ability, though you may spend a spell point to make them last for an additional minute per caster level afterwards. These illusions are considered tricks and do not cost spell points."

    "fool\u2019s counterspell (counterspell)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere or Mind sphere; Counterspell. Benefit:  When you successfully counter a spell, the caster must succeed at a Will save equal to your Illusion sphere DC or Mind sphere DC (whichever is greater), or believe the spell had its intended effect, even if they would otherwise be aware of its failure. Treat this effect as a figment with a duration equal to the countered spell, and use the rules for interacting with and investigating figments."
    },
    "illusionary blast (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Destruction sphere, Illusion sphere (Illusionary Touch (sensory, touch) x2). Benefit:  When creating a destructive blast, you may spend an additional spell point to allow your destructive blast to behave as if it were an illusion in specific ways; the destructive blast deals nonlethal damage regardless of other effects, blast types, or blast shapes applied, and no longer requires line of sight or line of effect in order to be created or strike a target. Special:  If you possess the Shadow Infusion Illusion talent, you may spend an additional spell point or shadow point to have your destructive blast deal damage as normal but still gain the other benefits of this feat."
    },
    "illustrious light (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere, Light sphere. Benefit:  Whenever you create a figment or glamer you may, as part of the same action, affect the figment or the creature or object subject to the glamer with your glow. Concentrating on the illusion and concentrating to create bright light can be done with the same action, and spending spell points to cause the illusion to endure without concentration double as spell points spent to cause the bright light to endure without concentration."
    },
    "implausible deniability (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Manipulate Aura (sensory, magic), Programmed Illusion), Mind sphere. Benefit:  You may have your illusions interact with Detect Thoughts and similar abilities as if they had an Intelligence score of up to twice your caster level. Whenever you place a glamer on a creature, you may spend an additional spell point to create an illusionary mind complete with false memories, including a false Intelligence score (for this purpose creatures with an Intelligence 0 are treated as invisible to effects such as thoughtsense). When a creature attempts to extract information directly from the mind or compel honest responses of anyone under the effects of glamers modified by this feat, they must first attempt a magic skill check against your magic skill defense. Failure indicates the information or response given is any information of your choosing, even false information. You do not need to be aware of the mental intrusion or compulsion to choose the information gained. The illusionary mind added to glamers modified by this feat constantly broadcasts misleading information. Abilities that would grant an insight bonus to attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, skill checks or armor class against the glamered creature instead incur a penalty of equal value. This also applies to any effects that rely on mind reading such as the battlefield relay symbiat class feature. Special:  If you possess the persuasive class feature you may add the bonus to save DC's to Illusion sphere abilities. This feat counts as a talent with the (Sensory: Mind) tag."

    "invisible friend (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Suppression (glamer)), Conjuration sphere (Shadow Creature (form)). Benefit:  When maintaining a companion with the Shadow Creature talent via concentration, it gains the benefits of the Invisibility glamer from the Suppression talent. As a free action, you may spend a spell point to allow your shadow companion to fully manifest itself. Your companion loses the Shadow Creature talent and gains one other (form) talent of your choosing in its place for one minute per caster level."
    },
    "shade (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Dark sphere, Illusion sphere. Benefit:  When creating a figment, you may, as part of the same action, create darkness as the base Dark sphere ability. Even if you do not choose to do so, the area occupied by your figments and those under the effects of your glamers counts as being within your darkness."
    },
    "solid illusions (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere, Illusion sphere (Illusionary Touch (sensory, touch) x2). Benefit:  You may enhance any illusions you create as if they were actually the creatures and objects they appear to be. Parts of the illusion can be enhanced separately - you could use the Enhance Equipment enhancement to grant an illusionary soldier an enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls with its non-existent spear. Additional damage from enhanced illusions deal nonlethal damage of their type (nonlethal fire damage, nonlethal bleed damage, etc.) unless your illusions are dealing lethal damage because of another talent, feat or ability (such as the Shadow Infusion talent)."
    },
    "superpositioned (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Decoy (glamer), Suppression (glamer)), Warp sphere, caster level 5th. Benefit:  While under the effects of the Suppression talent, you may use the Warp sphere teleporting only yourself and carried gear as a move action rather than a standard action. Whenever you use a Warp sphere effect on yourself, you may leave behind or appear with a copy of yourself that lasts until the start of your next turn as the Decoy trick."
    },
    "suppressed spell (metamagic)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Suppression (glamer)). Benefit:  Spells affected by this feat have a reduced manifestation. Being subjected to the effect requires a Perception check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level) or the target does not perceive the presence and source of the effect. Special:  For each (sensory) talent you possess, improve the Perception check DC by an additional +2 and hide sensation associated with that (sensory) talent. This has no effect on spells or sphere abilities that rely on a suppressed sensation( s) to function, but you may always forgo the +2 bonus to the Perception DC to allow the sensation of the effect to function normally. Cost:  +2 spell points"

    "surreinforcement (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Creation sphere; Illusion sphere (Shadow Infusion) or create reality class feature. Benefit:  When you create materials with the Creation sphere, they are laced with shadowstuff that grants you increased control over them. Objects you create with the Creation sphere regain a number of hit points equal to half your Creation caster level at the start of each of your turns and can repair themselves from the broken condition. Objects you create out of shadowstuff, such as with the fey adept's ability to Create Reality, have a hardness equal to your Illusion caster levels (minimum 5) and may gain the properties of any material with equal or less hardness."
    },
    "tactile illusion (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Illusionary Touch (sensory, touch) x2), Telekinesis sphere (Finesse). Benefit:  By weaving your illusions together with a hint of telekinetic force you can allow them to exert force more appropriate to their apparent nature. Your illusions can support weight or block movement of creatures or objects so long as all pressure and weight on it falls within the size limit of your telekinesis. However, anyone who disbelieves the illusion may choose to ignore the telekinetic effect, moving through the illusion as normal, as well as allowing them to throw or move items through it. In addition, you may deal lethal damage with your illusions instead of nonlethal damage."

You do not need to know what the creature looked like when it was alive to gain this benefit."
    },
    "wave-particle duality (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere, Light sphere. Benefit:  The light from your bright light becomes a spread rather than an emanation allowing it to move around corners and through tight spaces and small holes as if it was a gas. This light may penetrate areas and containers that are not airtight by spreading at a rate of 1 cube per 3 caster levels each round through cracks in doors, keyholes or other small gaps in construction."
    },
    "weird assault (combat)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Decoy (glamer), Mage Feint), base attack bonus +3. Benefit:  You may suppress two decoys surrounding you until the start of your next turn to use the Mage Feint talent as a swift action. Special:  If you possess the Weird Defense (Combat) feat and have its effect active, you can dismiss the effect instead of suppressing two decoys to use Mage Feint talent; using Mage Feint in this fashion does not require any additional actions."
    },
    "weird defense (combat)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Blur (glamer), Decoy (glamer)). Benefit:  As a swift action, you may grant yourself a miss chance equal to 10% + 5% per 2 caster levels (maximum 95%) until the start of your next turn or until an attack misses due to this feat. Effects that ignore concealment only reduce this miss chance by half (rounded down). This is a spell-like ability. For abilities that allow for re-rolls for attacks that miss due to concealment such as the Blind-Fight feat, instead calculate the miss chance as 10% + 5% per 3 caster levels and reroll on a miss as per normal for the ability."
    },
    "weird motion (combat)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Mage Feint), base attack bonus +3. Benefit:  Add your casting ability modifier as a circumstance bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity incurred when charging or making ranged attacks. In addition, as a full-round action you may make a single ranged or charge attack and use your Mage Feint talent as part of the same action against that target. Surreal Feats Surreal feats are feats that use or rely upon the irrational and unpredictable substance known as shadowstuff. All surreal feats are spell-like abilities that are treated as (figment, shadow) illusions for the purposes of interacting with other effects. Characters with the Shadow Infusion talent or the create reality class feature may spend spell points in place of shadow points to activate abilities granted by surreal feats. The first time you gain a surreal feat you also gain a shadow pool as the fey adept class feature, except it only contains a number of shadow points equal to the total number of surreal feats you possess. This stacks with any other shadow points. Wiki Note:  Many surreal feats require the shadowmark class feature. The Surreal Strike (surreal) feat grants this feature."
    },
    "emulation expert (surreal)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Manipulate Aura (sensory, magic)); Illusion sphere (Shadow Infusion) or shadow pool; Shadow Magic or create reality class feature. Benefit:  When using the Shadow Magic feat or create reality class feature to duplicate effects from another sphere, you may spend a shadow point to treat the effect as both from the Illusion sphere and the sphere it is mimicking. This allows you to apply bonuses from items, class features, talents or feats that benefit that sphere as well as the Illusion sphere. This feat does not allow you to apply the caster level bonus from staves for two different spheres. For example, when using create reality or Shadow Magic to produce a destructive blast, you may apply Destruction talents you possess and apply the caster level bonus from either a staff of Destruction or Illusion, apply bonus damage from elementalist energy specialization class feature and treat both your fey adept and elementalist levels as full caster levels for calculating the caster level."

For every 5 surreal feats you possess, you may grant yourself an additional temporary talent from the chosen sphere. You must still meet any prerequisites that the talents possess. When gaining multiple talents with this feat, you may use a talent gained this way as a prerequisite for other gained talents. Any sphere talents or abilities gained from this feat are treated as if they were from the Illusion sphere and possess the shadow descriptor. Shadow magic, by its nature, has a very real effect even if disbelieved, although usually a reduced one. Unless stated otherwise, objects created as shadow illusions are made of shadowstuff (stable), and creatures have 1/5th their normal hit points. The effective caster level of effects created using this feat is equal to your caster level in the Illusion sphere -2 (minimum 1). You may not have more than one sphere effect active at a time from the spheres granted from this feat. A second use of this feat immediately ends the duration of the previous use."

Benefit:  When using your shadowmark, you may spend an extra shadow point to change the effect from a ranged touch attack into a close-ranged cone.

In the case of exotic weapons, you must have studied a pre-existing version of the weapon for at least 1 week. This object dissipates one round after you are no longer in contact with it or if you use this feat a second time.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Shadowmark 3d6, shadow pool. Benefit:  You may spend a shadow point as a full-round action to make a single attack with your shadowmark. Rather than a ranged touch attack, treat your shadowmark as a melee touch attack with a 10-foot reach. Regardless of if your attack hits or not, you may make attacks of opportunity as melee touch attacks with a 10-foot reach with your shadowmark without additional expenditure of points from your shadow pool until the beginning of your next turn. If you have multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus or effects such as haste you can (as part of the full-round action) make as many attacks with your violent shadow as your base attack bonus allows. Archetypes Operative Operatives are Symbiats who use their mastery of Illusion and  War  to manage the battlefield.

Illusionist's Guide A common misconception with illusion magic is that an illusion is not real. This is only partially correct. Illusions are real, they just are not what they appear to be. They do have an effect on reality, but rely heavily on belief to complete the effect. What is an illusion? Mostly it is whatever is convenient at the time. An illusion contains elements of many other spheres, but is its own unique effect. Illusions alter perception, but are not a mind affecting, so do not require a mind or even the physiology needed to process the sensation. Illusions alter light and sound but are not dark, light, or sonic effects. Investigating and Interacting In a world deeply entrenched in magic there is almost nothing that is \"obviously\" trickery. If part of your person was to go through a wall it is equally possible that you are incorporeal as it is that the wall is an illusion. If a fire was unable to be doused by water it is equally likely that the flames are supernaturally hot through the power of destruction magic as it is that the inferno is imaginary. Senses have a way of justifying their input no matter how alien. In anything but the most extreme circumstances, interaction and investigation is a better model for creatures interacting with illusions. It would be impossible to categorize every potential interaction and expected result but as a general rule \"interacting\" occurs when a creature takes an action based on assumed qualities, such as the appearance or sensation of an illusion. If the illusion fails to possess those qualities interaction has taken place. Upon interacting with a figment, a creature is allowed to make a Will save to disbelieve the effect. For each subsequent interaction the creature gains a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus to the Will save for that specific figment. This bonus is lost if a creature spends a round without interacting with the figment. Upon interacting with a creature or object under the effects of a glamer, a creature acts as if any skill bonus granted by the glamer is two lower and any miss chance granted by the glamer is reduced by 10%. If the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature automatically succeeds on further checks against the same glamer and may ignore all other effects of the glamer. Glamers with the shadow descriptor cannot have their granted skill bonuses or miss chance reduced to lower than half (rounded up) by creatures interacting with them. As a move action a creature may investigate suspected figments. This becomes an interaction with any and all adjacent figments."

    "effects [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may create unconvincing illusions. This is the same as creating an illusion (see below) and The Trickster's Handbook \n$4.99 can include all senses you can affect through Illusion talents, except it is obviously fake (i.e., it is translucent, unrealistic, etc.), requiring no one to make a save to disbelieve. However, the effects can still be used to create distractions, display images, draw a map, or be used for entertainment. This counts as possessing the required tools to make any appropriate Perform check (such as creating a melody with the Audible Illusion talent)."

    "alter [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may make minor changes to objects or creatures up to your Illusion maximum size, such as changing their color, making them appear clean or dirty, making writing appear, or other minor alterations. This counts as having a disguise kit when making Disguise checks (which take the usual time instead of a standard action), but such a disguise still counts as being magical for the purposes of detecting magic or for spells and effects that allow a target to see through magical effects and illusions. Illusion (sensory: sight) [Core] As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create a silent visual illusion within range for as long as you concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. You cannot move further away from the illusion than your illusion range while maintaining it through concentration, and the illusion is limited in size according to Table: Illusion Maximum Size. The image may be anything you may clearly imagine, and behaves according to your desires. Table: Illusion Maximum Size Caster Level \n Illusion Maximum Size \n Maximum Size in cubes \n \n \n 1st \n Medium \n 5 ft cube \n \n \n 3rd \n Large \n 10 ft cube \n \n \n 5th \n Huge \n 15 ft cube \n \n \n 8th \n Gargantuan \n 20 ft cube \n \n \n 11th \n Colossal \n 30 ft cube \n \n \n 15th \n Colossal+ \n 40 ft cube \n \n \n 20th \n Colossal++ \n 50 ft cube \n \n \n 25th \n Colossal+++ \n 60 ft cube Simply perceiving an illusion isn't enough to detect it as fake, but any target who interacts with the illusion or carefully studies the area is allowed a Will save to disbelieve the image, recognizing it for what it is. Anyone who finds obvious evidence of trickery (ex: throws a rock through an illusionary wall) automatically disbelieves the illusion. You may only create visual illusions although certain talents may be taken to add more senses. The more complex an illusion is, the more talents it requires to be convincing, with the chart below serving as a guideline and the GM serving as the final arbiter for what talents are required to create a specific illusion. Table: Example Illusions Example of Illusion \n Required Talents \n \n \n An illusionary wall \n Base sphere only \n \n \n A glen full of trees \n Complex Illusion \n \n \n A warrior blocking the target's way \n Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch (to engage in combat w/ target) \n \n \n A table laden with food \n Illusionary Odor, Illusionary Touch (to be consumed by target) \n \n \n A room filled with fire \n Illusionary Sound, Illusionary Touch \n \n \n An army of orcs chasing the target \n Illusionary Sound, Complex Illusion, Illusionary Touch (to engage in combat w/ target) If creating an illusionary creature, your illusion has an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and a touch armor class equal to 10 + its size modifier + 1/2 your caster level + your casting ability modifier. An illusionary creature may provide a flanking bonus against targets who fail to disbelieve it. Any creature who strikes an illusion in combat automatically disbelieves it. Illusion Talent Types"

    "(figment)": {
      "benefits": "Illusions or tricks cast on an area are called figments and are transparent when disbelieved. You may choose to believe or disbelieve your own figments at-will, but not both at once. You must choose to believe or disbelieve your own illusions once per round as a non-action that may be taken any time during your turn. Allies do not automatically disbelieve your figments, but situations may occur that help them identify them. If you possess Selective Illusions, you may allow anyone to be treated as if they automatically saved. Even without Selective Illusions, you may grant your allies +5 to their Will saves to disbelieve your illusions by giving them information about your style or artistry present in your illusions or including a subtle tell. Alerting them to a specific casting improves this bonus to a +10. You may, however, always make alterations as you see fit and revoke this bonus from allies should the need arise to fool even them. A figment may be created anywhere within your maximum illusion range without need of line of sight nor line of effect and may be moved, directed or have its appearance altered after creation as a standard action or as part of the action to maintain via concentration. Figments can be moved at a speed of 20 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster levels per round and must remain within maximum illusion range. You still need to be able to see the figment to issue new orders, direct movement, or alter how it appears. The following original talents published in Spheres of Power have the (figment) descriptor: Complex Illusion, Enlarged Illusion, and Silence."

    "(glamer)": {
      "benefits": "Illusions or tricks cast on an object or creature are called glamers and are usually but not always considered harmless. The caster of the glamer and the recipient can see through the glamer and ignore its effects. Targets of the Hostile Glamers talent may make a Will save to negate the effect as normal. You must have line of sight, but are not required to have line of effect to place a glamer on a target. Glamers remain on the creature or object they are placed upon regardless of how quickly the target moves or distance between them and the caster. The following original talents published in Spheres of Power have the (glamer) descriptor: Illusionary Disguise, Invisibility, and Silence."

    },
    "(shadow)": {
      "benefits": "Shadow magic, despite its description relying on shadowstuff (which in most settings originates from the Shadow Plane), is not planar in nature. Shadowstuff does not require access, temporary or otherwise, to the Shadow Plane. In settings where shadow magic originates from an extraplanar source, shadow magic manipulates this other plane remotely and has an effect on the Material Plane without using or requiring any additional planar connection beyond the already relative closeness of the two planes. Any damage done by a shadow effect is untyped and may either be lethal or nonlethal. Shadow illusions, if disbelieved or otherwise would be negated or ignored by effects that only apply to illusions, has its effectiveness reduced by half (rounded down), including damage, miss chance, or granted circumstance bonuses or penalties. For Will saves, this changes the save to a Will partial save instead of Will negates.

    "lingering illusion [core]": {
      "benefits": "When you create an illusion, the illusion remains for 2 rounds after you stop concentrating. You may also spend a spell point to allow the illusion to remain for 1 minute per caster level without the need for concentration. When an illusion isn't maintained through concentration, it performs whatever set of actions it was last commanded to do, and cannot move beyond Medium range of where it was placed.

This bonus is tripled for creatures under the effects of the True Sight talent from the Divination sphere and similar effects that specifically grant a Will save bonus against illusions."
    },
    "blur (figment, glamer)": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may designate a single 5-ft. cube as distorting to perception. This distortion lasts for one round per caster level. Any effect originating from a source whose line of sight crosses this area incurs a 20% miss chance + 5% per caster level (maximum 50%) due to concealment. Any creature may make a Will save to ignore this miss chance for 1 round. You may only have one such disruption at a time. Using this trick a second time immediately end the duration of the previous casting of this trick. As an illusion you may create a distorting figment. This creates a figment version of the distortion created by the trick. As an illusion you may create a distorting glamer. This functions in all other ways as the trick except it does not allow for a Will save to ignore the miss chance and has the duration of a standard illusion. Stacking Miss Chance:  There are several sources that potentially cause an attack to automatically miss that stack. Rolling percentile three or more times for each attack against a well-prepared target can definitely slow down combat. Alternatively, when calculating multiple miss chances from separate sources, a single roll will suffice to produce the same probability of a miss. Greatest counts for full. Second-highest counts for 1/2. Third-highest counts for 1/4. Fourth-highest counts for 1/8. And so on, rounded down to the nearest 5%. When using this method, the miss chance may become greater than 50%, but should never be allowed to be higher than 95%. For additional effects that depend on the source (such as determining if a decoy was destroyed), roll an additional die to randomly select what effect ultimately caused the attack to miss."
    },
    "complex illusion (figment) [core]": {
      "benefits": "When creating an illusion, you may spend an additional spell point to divide the illusion into multiple, independent components. The combined size and range of these illusions must still be within your maximum illusion size, but each component can appear differently and behave differently. While each component can be given its own set of programmed instructions, you can only actively control one component at a time. Ex: when creating an illusion of a tavern, a creature with this talent could create a bustling group of people inside the tavern as part of the same illusion. The caster could only control one such illusionary person at a time though; and the rest would only perform their last set of instructions. Giving a component a new set of instructions is a move action. If a creature makes its saving throw against a complex illusion, it sees through the entire illusion rather than only one component part."
    },
    "control figment (figment)": {
      "benefits": "As a full-round action you may make a magic skill check against the magic skill defense of the controller of an existing figment. If successful you gain control of the figment and may command it as if it was your effect. Treat the figment in all ways as if it was cast by you except this does not change any of the original variables related to caster level, Illusion sphere talents, class abilities or spell points. You however must remain within the maximum range that you may control illusions to maintain this effect as normal."
    },
    "distracting phantoms (figment)": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may designate a 5 ft. cube within your illusion range as a flanking partner for you and your allies. This partner remains for one round per caster level. You may only have one phantasmal flanking partner at a time. Creating a new cube causes the previous one to immediately dissipate. As a trick you may use the aid another action on attack or defense within range of your illusions. Instead of an attack roll the target is allowed a Will save to ignore this effect. Your figments count as flanking partners with reach appropriate for their size against all creatures that have failed their Will save to disbelieve."
    },
    "decoy (figment, glamer)": {
      "benefits": "As a trick you may create an illusionary creature in the same square as the target. This illusionary creature follows and occupies the same square as the target. Anyone attempting to attack the target must make a Will save or suffer a 50% miss chance. On a miss caused by this effect, the attacker targets the illusionary creature instead. The illusionary creature has an AC of 5 and is unaffected by area attacks. Illusionary creatures created by this trick last 1 round per two caster levels (minimum 1) or until struck with a single target effect. As a trick you may create a coaxing decoy in an adjacent square. The coaxing decoy may immediately move up to the speed of your figments in any direction unimpeded. The coaxing decoy is immune to damage and vanishes at the end of your turn. If the movement of the coaxing decoy would provoke an attack of opportunity from a creature, that creature must use it on the coaxing decoy. Creatures may make a Will save for each attack the decoy provokes from them to ignore this effect. As a glamer you may surround a target with a number of illusionary creatures equal to 2 +1 per 3 caster levels. As long as one or more illusionary creatures remain, the target gains a 50% miss chance. These decoys function exactly like the illusionary copies described in the illusionary creature trick except they possess AC equal to the touch AC of the target and have the normal duration for your illusions. Multiple castings of this glamer stack but a target cannot have more illusionary creatures attached to them than half their Hit Dice if targeted multiple times. If you possess the Complex Illusions talent one or more of the illusionary creatures granted by the glamer may act as as the coaxing decoy trick. As a free action once per round each illusionary creature may move 5 ft. per 2 caster levels independently of the original target. Illusionary creatures moving independently instantly vanish if they are beyond 15 ft. of the original target. While moving independently illusionary creatures provoke attacks of opportunity as the coaxing decoy trick. Unless adjacent to the original target illusionary creatures are treated in all ways as figments and if disbelieved do not grant their miss chance or provoke attacks of opportunity. If disbelieved as figments, copies acting independently reset the status of their disbelief by returning to the same square as the original."

    },
    "illusionary terrain (figment)": {
      "benefits": "As a trick, you may designate a single cube as difficult terrain for one round per caster level. A Will save to disbelieve is allowed by all who enter the cube.

You may treat the area of your figments as difficult terrain regardless of type of movement for those who fail to disbelieve."

Whenever a creature inside the figment negates damage due to energy resistance or damage reduction, they suffer an equal amount of nonlethal damage, as if the damage was never negated. This damage is felt even if the figment is disbelieved.

Instead, they are allowed a new saving throw each round they are in contact with the illusion. Your illusion still cannot hold weight (thus while touching the wall would only grant a new saving throw, leaning on the wall would still cause the creature to fall through and disbelieve). You may take this talent a total of twice; when taken a second time, your illusions may also cause pain. When coming into contact with an appropriate illusion (stepping into fire, being hit by an illusionary enemy, etc.), if the subject fails their Will save to disbelieve, they take non-lethal damage equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier. A target can only be damaged by your illusions once in a round, no matter how many times it thinks the illusion has hurt it."

A target examining this aura through detection magic is allowed a Will save to see through the trick, but on a failure believes the aura and does not detect this trick.

    "example of interaction": {
      "benefits": "There is a figment of a dragon guarding a doorway. The Mage:  Uses Warp to teleport past the \"dragon\". The \"dragon\" is not assumed by the mage to have any abilities that would alert it to this action or allow it to prevent the action from occurring and the mage is successful. No abilities the mage assumed the \"dragon\" to have are confirmed to be lacking so no interaction has taken place. The Rogue:  Uses stealth to sneak past the \"dragon\". The \"dragon\" looks, sounds and smells real and the thief can feel the heat of dragon breath but the \"dragon\" does not react when the sneaking thief gets close. It is assumed that the \"dragon\" would attack any creature it was aware of in the room, but the thief has not confirmed that the \"dragon\" is actually aware of his presence so no interaction has taken place when the \"dragon\" remains stationary. The Warrior:  Loudly rushes into position to flank the \"dragon\" while screaming a battle cry. It is assumed this would alert the \"dragon\" but it does not move. The warrior has interacted with the figment. Upon reaching a sound position the warrior attacks the \"dragon\" but his blade passes through it without resistance. It is assumed the \"dragon\" and the weapon are both solid. The warrior has interacted with the figment a second time. Affecting Complex or Exotic Senses Illusion can foil all forms of perception, even unusual forms that many creatures possess. Use the following list when dealing with unusual senses. Detect Magic:  Manipulate Aura (Sensory: Magic) \n Blindsense:  Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell) and Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound) \n Blindsight:  Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell), Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound), and Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) \n Darkvision:  Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) (However, keep in mind that darkvision is monochromatic. To fool darkvision at the same time as full colored vision should require Complex Illusion to maintain colored and non-colored elements separately.) \n Color Blindness:  Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) (same caveat as darkvision) \n Echolocation:  Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound) through air, Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) through water \n Scent or Keen Scent:  Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell) \n Lifesense:  Manipulate Aura (Sensory: Magic) (unless the description of the specific sense is extraordinary or mentions/ implies heat, in that case Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) is required instead) \n Low-light Vision:  Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) \"sight\" that can see through objects: Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight) (Senses such as See in Darkness, X-Ray Vision, Mistsight, Greensight that can penetrate specific sorts of occlusion only require sight to be fooled. However, creating an illusion that they would be expected to penetrate is suspicious enough to count as obvious signs of trickery.) \n Thoughtsense or Detect Thoughts:  Implausable Deniability feat (Sensory: Mind), also Phantom Mind despite not being a sensory talent as a side effect may create figments that interact with these senses as a creature with an Int score up to half of the level of the caster. For glamers, Manipulate Aura can hide or modify the apparent intellect of a creature adding or subtracting up to twice their caster level. For this purpose creatures with an Intelligence 0 are treated as invisible to thoughtsense. This does not render your mind immune to being read. \n Tremorsense:  Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch) \n Trueseeing:  Effects that automatically see through illusions such as the truesight fey adept class feature or the true seeing spell (or True Seeing advanced talent) are only half as effective against (shadow) illusions. For (shadow): Illusion sphere (Sensory: Sight), Illusionary Sound (Sensory: Sound), Illusionary Touch (Sensory: Touch), Illusionary Odor (Sensory: Taste & Smell) and Manipulate Aura (Sensory: Magic). Keep in mind that the skill bonus granted by the glamer is already halved. Trueseeing has no effect on (suppression) talents. For figments, if you do not possess all of the indicated (sensory) talent(s) associated with that form of perception, creatures with that sense are automatically treated as interacting with your figment the first time it comes within range of the sense. Interacting in this manner allows for a Will save to disbelieve the illusion with a +2 circumstance bonus for each missing talent. For glamers, every sensory talent you lack to fool the listed sense, the creature acts as if any skill bonus granted by the glamer is two lower and any miss chance granted by the glamer is reduced by 10%. If the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature may ignore all other effects of the glamer. For suppressions, if all senses that make up the complex sense are suppressed by the effect, the complex sense fails to penetrate that area. When using Silence as a glamer, the affected creature treats all complex senses with all their base components suppressed as having range of 0. Illusions That Create Cover Or Concealment Figments and glamers provide concealment if they block line of sight. A figment of a wall for example would grant total concealment unless the attacker disbelieved the illusion, whereas a figment of fog would only grant partial concealment. Shadow Figments that grant a miss chance or concealment also grant soft cover. Glamers that are used to change the size of a creature to appear larger grants a 10% miss chance for each size increase due to concealment. If a creature is glamered to appear larger it would provide a cover bonus to another target it grants the same concealment bonus to miss chance. Shadow Glamers that grant a miss chance or concealment also grant soft cover. Based on the description of their manifestation, at the GM's discretion other glamers modified by the shadow descriptor (such as Illusionary Disguise) could instead grant up to a +2 bonus to AC of any type reflected by the description of the glamer. Mastering Deception Illusion is among the most versatile of magics, and as such odds are illusion can solve almost any problem. If you possess Shadow Infusion, time and spell points you definitely have all the tools you need to handle 90% of non-combat situations. Contrary to popular belief illusion magic is actually one of the better combat options despite a lack of burst damage for offense."

    "weaponizing deception": {
      "benefits": "Glamers stick to the target that they are placed on, meaning they cannot be outrun. Hostile glamers used offensively will remain on their target regardless of distance. You could place a glamer of flesh melting acid on a target with Illusionary Touch (twice). This imaginary acid cannot be cleaned off or removed and lasts up to a minute per caster level until the caster gets bored of the spectacle or the victim finally makes their Will save. Likewise, figments are not real and do not require line of sight nor line of effect to be created. The area that they occupy is not interrupted or blocked by physical barriers. Unlike more obviously combat focused magics like Death and Destruction, Illusion can set a dungeon on \"fire\" without even knowing it exists. Pairing Illusion with Divination, reflections or clever guesswork is one of the few and best methods of magical indirect fire."
    },
    "battlefield manipulation": {
      "benefits": "With illusions, allies may be out of sight but are rarely out of touch. So long as allies are within the range of your illusions, no party is truly split and no hero is ever alone. Illusions, even simple tricks, can be used to collaborate and communicate over long distances, through barriers, and with clever application of the right talents (such as Manipulate Aura) even across large gulfs of time. Often, the best use of a battlefield illusion is to have enemies commit bold errors, not dissuade action. Have your illusionary allies or decoys soak up attacks of opportunity and readied actions. This a quick and easy way to allow your party to move unimpeded and engage in what would otherwise be very risky tactics, such as breaking an enemy line. Generally it is a better use of an illusion, especially a trick, to make a foe waste time, energy, and resources than it is to prevent them from acting at all. Gently guide your enemy to give them neither the time nor reason to test for deception. It is usually best to avoid the total obstruction of fully solid wall that will come into question the moment opposition reaches it and has nothing better to do than investigate it. Instead it is better to leave overt openings or obvious detours to direct foes to a choice location rather than risk one lucky Will save that will reveal your barrier as the illusion it is. Combined with talents like Illusionary Labyrinth you can keep weak willed enemies harmlessly contained within an unending hedge maze, mud pit or fog bank."
    },
    "unseen hazards": {
      "benefits": "Many assume that illusions must explicitly be visual, but this is incorrect. If your goal is to trap or cause harm you may not want to produce a visual effect. If you wish to do harm without an expressed visual manifestation, extreme heat, cold, pressure, nerve pain or other sensations can be created without being \"seen\". When getting the drop on foes, an illusionist could create an illusion without sensory manifestation or an exact copy of the area the illusion has been cast on to be changed, moved or altered later as a valid ambush tactic. Programmed illusions can function as confusing and terrifying \"traps\" on the battlefield, more so if you also possess Selective Illusions so only the victim and not his allies experiences the desired effect."
    },
    "target discrimination and maintaining pressure": {
      "benefits": "Complex Illusion allows you to break up an illusion into separate components. You can easily leave your allies out of the initial casting of an effect if you are concerned that they will not make the save or if it does not allow for a save to disbelieve such as suppression effects. With Programmed Illusion you may automatically have your divided figments move to squares occupied by the enemies they were initially cast upon without having to spend an individual action to move each separate component. Stacking every potential debuff and hazard at your disposal on individual squares that \"chase\" enemies can turn the tide of a skirmish with a single casting. Do be aware that Programmed Illusion is automated and as such may cross the path of allies while while moving to targets designated this way. Selective Illusions however can reduce the harm done by this or a second command (if granted by sufficient caster level) instructing your figments to move around allied squares. Purpose-Driven Figments Mechanically speaking there are no hard rules for how a fooled creature will react to figments. When creating a figment it is a good idea to state an intended purpose in creating it. In an effort to keep illusion as freeform as possible these are only suggestions for GMs and players to better communicate. A figment could be described as any one or more of the following:"
    },
    "aversion": {
      "benefits": "Figments that appear to be threatening or unpleasant in some way. Creatures react with caution to the illusion but are not frightened by it. Fooled creatures must make every reasonable effort to leave the area of the figment and any squares adjacent to the figment so long as doing so does not present an overt and fatal risk."
    },
    "attraction": {
      "benefits": "Figments that appear to be the most tactically sound or pleasant decision. Fooled creatures must make every reasonable effort to approach and remain as close to or within the figment as possible so long as doing so does not present an overt and fatal risk. Illusions of this sort lose their attractive properties if they cause harm. At GM discretion creatures may be denied their Dexterity bonus to AC if they mistakenly believe an illusion is providing a tactical advantage such as cover or concealment."
    },
    "deadly threat": {
      "benefits": "Figments that appear to be worthy of caution and carefully avoided. Given the option, fooled creatures will move away from the figment even if doing so requires disengaging. Fooled creatures will not willingly attack the figment nor anyone adjacent to it and will make every effort to face the figment even if to do so would expose them to other \"lesser\" threats."
    },
    "obstruction": {
      "benefits": "Figments that appear to be very solid largely immovable objects cause fooled creatures to never willingly enter their area or attempt to attack through them. Fooled creatures actively resist any attempt to move them into the area."
    },
    "priority target": {
      "benefits": "Figments that appear to be too eminently and fatally dangerous to leave alone, but easy to neutralize and/or probably delicious. If possible, fooled creatures will attempt to approach, attack, and/or destroy the figment to their fullest ability even if doing so requires breaking off a current engagement or risking injury so long as the potential injury is not obviously fatal."
    },
    "safe": {
      "benefits": "Figments that conceal a hazard or threat. Fooled creatures will move through the area if doing so is efficient for their objectives. At the GM's discretion, if the hazard is one that normally allows for a saving throw or attack roll, a -2 penalty to the saving throw or AC of fooled creatures may be appropriate. The intended purpose of a figment need not be only one of these things, universally applicable or even uniform throughout the entire space occupied by the figment. As an example: A wall with windows and a doorway. Most of the wall could be described as an obstruction, the windows being tactically attractive for ranged combatants who wish to use them for their low cover without blocking their fire and the doorway attractive to melee combatants who see it as the path of least resistance to close distance with their foes. This entire wall could be sitting over a deadly fall making the entire area appear to be \"safe\". Thematics and Theatrics There is not nor should there be any assumed fluff for how the sensation of an illusion manifests. Illusionists should be free to be creative when explaining how the mechanical benefit without shying away from personal flair. Some examples of the freedom that should not only be allowed but encouraged are given below. Decoys need not follow the model of the mirror image spell and be limited to strictly being exact copies of the creature that they are attached to. There is no reason the mechanical effect cannot be expressed as a small squad of orcish bodyguards, a handful of taunting fey, frightening spirits or animated objects interposing themselves between you and attacks while looking menacing. Blur (despite sharing a name with a spell that describes the effect as making a creature hazy with their outline shifting and wavering) can be expressed as anything that could be expected to interfere with clearly observing a target. Shattered glass, refractions, falling leaves, swarms of insects or a flock of sparrows could all create a concealment miss chance. Disguises don't have to be used for deception solely to hide an appearance, they could also add to the original form. Applying a disguise for other benefits such as Hostile Glamers could manifest as the original target but on fire. Perhaps you want to make a disguise with Shadow Infusion to gain the cover bonus to armor class, this could manifest as the original target but with an ominous spirit interposed upon their form. Illusionary Labyrinth implies getting lost or being forced to turn around in confusion, but it need not be the only explanation for using an illusion to control the movement of a victim. This could instead be black tentacles extending from a non-euclidian void dragging their horrified victims to unknown destinations. A mass of webs, tar or thorns that prevents movement could equally explain a victim believing that they are unable to move. Illusionary Terrain not only doesn't have to be a change of the ground, but only describing it that way fails to explain how it also applies to other kinds of movement such as flight, levitation or swimming. A space filled with slime, tornados or half manifested spiritual hands clawing at all who enter the space however does. To summarize, whatever the mechanics say an illusion does is what it does mechanically only. The explanation of how or why the illusion appears to work, however should not only be the duty but the pleasure of the illusionist that created it. The more strange, comical, horrifying and personally thematic that explanation is the better. As always, do respect the tone and themes of the game you are playing and more importantly the work your game master puts into maintaining a sense of atmosphere and the suspension of disbelief. Immunity and Susceptibility There is a rare creature on occasion that notes that it is completely immune to illusions. This is usually based on the presumption that an illusion is a purely visual effect. GMs should be encouraged to evaluate why a creature may be immune to illusions and see if the rules provided for complex senses are more applicable. If a creature is still deemed to still be immune to illusions use the rules for trueseeing (as described in the section entitled: Affecting Complex or Exotic Senses). Sensation for the purposes of illusion magic is a separate thing from the mind or biology and neither a mind nor the necessary biology is required to be affected by an illusion. Constructs, plants, oozes, undead and many vermin lack eyes, ears, noses, nerves and anything that we would recognize as a mind, but have always been affected by illusion magic as easily as any other creature. Unless specifically noted, normally lacking the ability to experience a sensation created by an illusion does not render a creature automatically unaffected by it. Clarifications"

    "create reality": {
      "benefits": "The class feature create reality adds a modified (shadow) descriptor to an illusion. All the individual effects except for Disguise from the create reality class feature are Illusion sphere (figment, shadow) effects. Disguise however is a (glamer, shadow) effect. Illusion talents modify these class features the same way they would modify other Illusion sphere effects. Shadowmark is also a (figment, shadow) but is obviously an illusion effect. The damage and other effects of shadowmark assume automatic disbelief and cannot be reduced further by disbelief."

    "manipulate aura": {
      "benefits": "May be used on areas to conceal or create ambient evidence of magic from any school, sphere or specific spell. The trick granted by Manipulate Aura can only create or hide auras whose caster level is no greater than twice your caster level. In addition to the granted trick, Manipulate Aura is a (sensory) talent that allows you to change the auras of your illusions to appear to be from any school or sphere of magic or even radiate no aura at all. The strength of the illusionary aura can appear to be up to twice your caster level. Unlike other illusions, Manipulate Aura is always observed by opposed magic or supernatural abilities and effects, as such an opposed magic skill check, not a Will save is required to negate the effect. True Sight and similar effects add to the magic skill check in addition to Will saves against other illusions."

(Vitality) talents always have a duration of up to 1 minute starting at the time the effect was used, or until the target takes damage from either failing a saving throw or being hit with an attack roll. If a caster possesses multiple (vitality) talents, they may only grant one to the target of their Life sphere effect, but may choose to grant different benefits to each target of a particular Life sphere ability. A creature can benefit from a (vitality) talent attached to a Life ability, even if they do not actually gain anything from the Life ability (such as using cure on a creature at full hit points). Life Talents"

    "adrenaline surge": {
      "benefits": "When you use a Life sphere talent or ability on an ally other than yourself, you may spend one spell point to also give them an adrenaline surge. The ally may do one of the following as an immediate action: make an attack at their highest base attack bonus \n move their speed, drawing attacks of opportunity normally \n make an Escape Artist check with a bonus equal to your caster level \n draw, pick up, or ready a weapon or shield \n stand up from prone You may use this ability to surge multiple allies (other than yourself) at a time when you perform a Life sphere ability that affects multiple allies by spending a second spell point. Surges are resolved in initiative order."

    "affliction": {
      "benefits": "You may use your restore ability to interfere with the life energy of living creatures. As a standard action, you may use your restore ability as a touch attack that interferes with the life energies of a creature. This costs the same as a normal use of restore would. The creature must make a Will save, or they are exhausted for 2d6 rounds. If they pass their saving throw, they are instead fatigued for 2d6 rounds. Unlike regular fatigue and exhaustion, this condition ends as soon as the duration expires. If you possess other Life talents that let you remove conditions, then you may have other options available to you. Only one condition may be inflicted per use of this ability. If you possess the Restore Composure talent, you may cause the target to become disoriented for 1d6 rounds if they fail their Will saving throw. During this time, they are unable to use or concentrate on sphere abilities or spells, take a -5 penalty to Perception checks, and can not benefit from morale bonuses. If you possess the Restore Health talent, you may make the target nauseated for 1d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw. If they succeed, they are sickened for 1d6 rounds instead. If you possess the Restore Mind talent, you may make the target confused for 1d6 rounds if they fail a Will saving throw. If you possess the Restore Movement talent, you may may cause the target to lose some control of their body. If they fail a Reflex saving throw, they gain the entangled condition and are unable to leave their square for 1d6 rounds. There is no physical restraint created, so effects such as the freedom word from the Fate sphere does not help them. If you possess the Restore Senses talent, you may make a creature lose a sense of your choice that you are aware they have, causing it to become either blind or deaf (your choice), or to lose one special sense such as the scent ability, tremorsense, blindsense, blindsight, etc. The effect lasts for 2d6 rounds. A successful Will save negates this effect. If you possess the Restore Soul talent, you may cause the creature to become unable to be the recipient of any healing for 2d6 rounds, including those from fast healing or regeneration. No saving throw is allowed against this effect."
    },
    "break enchantment": {
      "benefits": "As a special application of restore, you may spend an additional spell point to remove all magic from the target that has a duration instead of restoring mind, body, or soul. This may be used against curses including cursed equipment, although it does not remove the curse from the equipment and instead suppresses the effect long enough for the item to be removed. Instead of a saving throw, you must succeed at a magic skill check against each magical effect in order to remove it. You may choose not to remove certain effects if you so desire (for example, you may target only harmful effects and not beneficial ones). This counts as using the break enchantment or remove curse spell against those spells and effects that specify they can only be removed through those spells. This has no effect on other instantaneous effects."
    },
    "clarified strike [strike]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may make a single ranged or melee attack coupled with a Life sphere ability. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also struck by the Life sphere effect. If using a scatter weapon, the effect only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack."

      "benefits": "As a swift action, you can learn any conditions that are affecting a living creature (unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, etc) within range of your Life sphere abilities. By increasing the casting time of this ability to a standard action or by spending a spell point, you can learn the details of any condition they are under, such as whether they have been affected by a spell or the nature of any disease or poison they are afflicted with. You may use this on a deceased creature to determine how they died, so long as the target has been dead for no more than one day per caster level. You may also use this ability on any ally that is currently under the effect of one of your Life sphere abilities regardless of range or line of effect (such as allies who currently possess temporary hit points from your invigorate ability), as long as they are on the same plane of existence. You always know the direction and distance to your ally."
    },
    "empathic healing": {
      "benefits": "You may restore others by taking on their injuries yourself. Doing so reduces the cost of the Life sphere effect by 1 spell point to a minimum of 0 spell points. When you restore a creature empathically, you gain any conditions you removed from the creature as if you had been the one originally affected. Likewise, you gain any attribute drain or damage, or any negative levels they had. You may not transfer conditions that will kill you or render you unconscious, or conditions that are the result of ongoing effects (such as being shaken within a totem of doom). You may select which conditions to transfer and which to leave untreated. If the effect causing the condition allowed a save, you do not get a new save, though any effects on you that would protect you from the condition still function for the duration you have them. If you already have that condition, any duration it may have adds to the duration of the condition you have, but otherwise you are unchanged. If you use this talent to restore multiple creatures, the durations of conditions removed stack if possible, but do not otherwise worsen."
    },
    "esoteric healing": {
      "benefits": "When you use your Life sphere abilities, you may choose for them to not be positive energy effects. Used this way, your Life sphere abilities can heal non-living creatures such as constructs or undead, though they do not work on inanimate objects. This does not allow you to harm creatures you could not harm before with positive energy."

    "fount of life": {
      "benefits": "You may store a cure within yourself, allowing you to access that healing as needed throughout the day. You spend a spell point and roll the damage healed as normal, except rather than healing by the given amount, that amount of healing is stored. You may store multiple cures in this manner to increase the amount of stored healing, but you cannot store more healing within you than 10 x your caster level. Stored healing is lost when you rest to recover spell points. You may draw on this stored healing to heal targets exactly as if using your cure ability, except you do not need to spend a spell point; you may choose the amount of healing granted (to a maximum amount equal to your stored healing), and any healing granted to a target is subtracted from your stored healing."
    },
    "greater invigorate": {
      "benefits": "When placing an invigorate on a target, add your casting ability modifier to the amount of temporary hit points granted, and increase the duration to 1 hour per caster level. You may spend a spell point when using invigorate to allow your invigorate to increase a target's effective hit point total to reach beyond their usual hit point total, as is normal with temporary hit points. This means you may use this talent to grant an invigorate to a creature already at its maximum hit points."
    },
    "greater restore [warden]": {
      "benefits": "When using your restore ability, you may spend an additional spell point to select two options when using restore instead of one (such as restoring both mind and soul).

    },
    "instill life [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill a cure, a restore, or an invigorate used in conjunction with the Greater Invigorate talent, or a use of the Affliction talent, which functions as a potion or oil. This cannot be augmented by the Empathic Healing talent. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "latent healing": {
      "benefits": "When you use cure or invigorate on a target, you may choose to delay its effects. You may apply effects that add additional hit points of healing at the time of the initial cure, such as additional hit points from Fount of Life. At any point, the subject of the effect can trigger its effects as a swift action. You may even target uninjured targets when using your abilities this way, though the effects can only be triggered when the target is injured. Healing delayed this way lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until used, whichever comes first. A target can only be under the effects of one Latent Healing at a time."
    },
    "lingering resilience": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you remove a condition completely from a creature using your restore ability, they are completely immune to that condition for 2 rounds. Being immune to a condition does not provide any additional defense against more severe versions of a condition, and they can not be made immune to a condition they did not have. This may not provide immunity to ability damage, ability drain, death, or negative levels. Whenever an ally regains hit points from you using your cure ability, they gain damage reduction equal to 1/2 your caster level or the number of hit points regained (whichever is less) for 2 rounds. This is not compatible with any form of fast healing you may grant."

You may take this talent a second time to increase the duration of the revitalize effect to 1 hour per caster level, but the effect ends early if the target is healed a total number of hit points equal to 10 x your caster level x (1 + the number of (cure) talents you possess).

    "sanctify": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to summon positive energy and hit a target within range of your cure ability as a touch attack. Creatures vulnerable to positive energy gain one temporary negative level for one hour per caster level (no save), even if they are normally immune to negative levels. This increases by 1 die size per 5 caster levels (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, and 1d6). These levels stack, but do not destroy an undead creature if they have as many negative levels as Hit Dice. Instead, if a negative level would reduce the creature to 0 Hit Dice, the creature instead takes 4 points of Constitution drain (even if they are normally immune to ability drain) or Charisma drain if they have no Constitution score for the duration of the effect. A negative energy effect that causes negative levels can be used to remove these negative levels before they become permanent. If a negative level lasts longer than 1 day, the target must pass a Fortitude save per negative level or have the negative level become permanent. If this ability is used on a creature normally healed by positive energy, each negative level that would be inflicted instead cures 1 temporary negative level the creature has or suppresses one permanent negative level for 1 minute per caster level. Any remaining negative levels grant the creature 5 temporary hit points per negative level, which last for 1 hour."

Prerequisites:  Life sphere (Lingering Resilience), caster level 5th. As a special application of restore, instead of removing a condition from the target, you grant the target a protective mark for 1 minute per caster level. The next time the target would be affected by a negative condition, the protective mark's duration immediately ends and the target delays the onset of the negative condition for a number of rounds equal to 1/4 your caster level (minimum 1). A negative condition delayed by this effect must be one that could be removed with a restore sphere effect or the Break Enchantment talent; rounds spent delaying the negative condition do not count toward the negative condition's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the target delayed its effect several rounds). A creature cannot have more than one protective mark from this talent at one time. The spell point cost of a restore effect modified by this talent is reduced by 1 sp (minimum 0). If you spend an additional spell point, you may use this talent as an immediate action; however, the duration of a protective mark applied as part of a swift or immediate action is reduced to 1 round.

Every cell of their body is so imbued with positive energy that they are no longer a single living being, but a collection of living cells creating a gestalt. Each individual cell can survive on its own and actively fights to keep the whole body functioning: blood will crawl back into the wounds that released them, broken bones will straighten themselves, and wounds will actively close and seal shut. The hypervitalized creature gains the following benefits: Immunity to bleed, death effects, damage from positive energy effects, disease (magical and non-magical), paralysis, poison, sleep effects, aging effects, and stunning. \n Not subject to nonlethal damage of any kind. Immunity to damage or drain to its ability scores, as well as to exhaustion and fatigue effects. These do not protect the character from the results of their own abilities (such as nonlethal damage caused by the Draining Casting drawback) or voluntarily gained through helpful effects (such as the Overclocked talent). \n Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). \n The fast healing granted by Revitalize is upgraded to regeneration; severed limbs can be reattached to the body (and indeed, will try to reattach themselves if possible). The target is not at risk of death from massive damage, not disabled at 0 hit points, and at negative hit points is unconscious but stable, even if exceeding the Constitution score. It can only be killed if the body is deliberately destroyed, such as being immolated or disintegrated, or by allowing the effect to expire while at negative hit points greater than their Constitution score. Creatures that possess abilities that allow them to stay conscious at 0 or fewer hit points still fall unconscious if they would normally die from the amount of damage they have received. \n Does not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep."

This does not mimic any other benefits of a miracle or wish spell. Additionally, they are healed of all broken bones, severed body parts (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multi-headed creatures), and ruined organs.

The target is restored to full health and any ability scores drained or damaged to 0 are raised to 1, but otherwise, any conditions the target was under when it died return when it is raised (disease, poison, curses, etc.). A restore can be applied simultaneously with the resurrection to counteract these conditions. Missing body parts are not restored, although the wounds are sealed and do not bleed. The target also gains two permanent negative levels when it is raised or suffers 2 points of Constitution drain for every negative level it would be reduced below 1st level.

      "benefits": "You bend the forces of the cosmos to the heartbeat of mortality. \n Prerequisites:  Fate sphere; Death sphere or Life sphere; caster level 3rd. Benefits:  Whenever a Fate sphere effect you create would use an alignment, you may instead choose living or undead. Living and undead are considered opposite alignments that are 3 steps away from each other and do not have an alignment aura (such as determining additional penalties to the saving throw associated with the Enmity (word) talent or the Reveal Alignment (consecration) revealing whether the creatures inside are living or dead). You must possess the Death sphere to choose living or the Life sphere to choose undead. You may treat yourself as either living or undead when creating a consecration to exclude yourself from its effects (as you would normally be your own alignment and unaffected). In addition, whenever you use the Serendipity consecration, you may modify it with one of the following: Living Bastion (requires Life sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to sacred and only grants bonuses to living creatures (or penalizes undead creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any living creature healed by a magical effect inside this consecration heals up to an additional +1 hit point per Hit Dice they possess (to a maximum of the original amount healed). \n Unliving Bastion (requires Death sphere):  Instead of its regular effects, your Serendipity consecration bonus changes to profane and only grants bonuses to undead (or penalizes living creatures if you possess the Greater Serendipity talent), increasing by +1 for every 10 caster levels you possess. Any undead created inside this consecration gains an additional +1 hit points per Hit Dice they possess. Sphere effects modified with this feat are still treated as the original talent for all purposes, and as such, do not stack with those same talents unmodified by this feat. This prevents a character from benefiting from both the Hallow (word) against evil and the Hallow (word) against undead, as modified by this feat, against the same target or effect. Likewise, a regular Serendipity consecration and the Living Bastion-modified Serendipity consecration's effects would not stack, despite granting different bonus types. Note:  For the purposes of this feat, a living creature is any creature with a Constitution score. Example:  A Fate sphere caster uses the Divine Force (consecration) talent. Instead of using the Fate sphere caster's alignment, the caster chooses living and affects any undead, regardless of their alignment, and does not affect living creatures. That same caster uses the Enmity (word) talent, choosing undead and targeting a living creature. The living creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or be blinded as though their alignment were 3 steps away from the caster's."

    "break enchantment [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend an additional spell point to allow your restore ability to removes all magic from the target that has a duration. This may be used against curses including cursed equipment, although it does not remove the curse from the equipment, but instead suppresses the effect long enough for the item to be removed. You must succeed at a magic skill check against each magical effect in order to remove it. You may choose not to remove certain effects if you so desire (for example, you may target only harmful effects and not beneficial ones). This counts as using the break enchantment or remove curse spell against those spells and effects that specify they can only be removed through those spells. This has no effect on instantaneous effects."

If successful, the creature targeted must make a Fortitude save vs a DC of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your casting ability modifier or they receive all the conditions you just restored, except for those they are immune to. These conditions last one round, regardless of the original duration of the restored conditions. If the creature targeted is missed or they pass their saving throw, the creature is still restored. If this is used in conjunction with Mass Restore, multiple enemies can be targeted, but each enemy can only receive conditions transferred from one ally and each ally must have all their conditions transferred to a single target. You may only move conditions this way, not ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels."

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to disrupt the life energies of a living creature within range of your cure ability by making a touch attack.

You may store multiple cures in this manner to increase the amount of stored healing, but you cannot store more healing within you than 10 x your caster level. Stored healing is lost when you rest to recover spell points. You may draw on this stored healing to heal targets exactly as if using your cure ability, except you do not need to spend a spell point; you may choose the amount of healing granted (to a maximum amount equal to your stored healing), and any healing granted to a target is subtracted from your stored healing."

    "the channeler": {
      "benefits": "The channeler is a powerful healer who relies on energy channeling to deliver healing to allies in close range. The short range of their channels means they will often be in the front lines of battle, so they are often melee capable, but not as capable as others. They may also be exorcist, as the investment is small for those who have channel energy class features. They will frequently take the Life sphere with the Limited Restoration (cure/invigorate) drawback\u2014preferring to rely on their channel energy for healing. They will augment their channel energy with Channel Life to synergize their abilities, but otherwise they do not need to invest heavily in the Life sphere to be effective."

Their ability to turn positive energy into blasts that can hurt undead and frequently hurt many other kinds of creature gives them range and versatility in many situations, but the existence of enemies immune to their positive energy means they can not rely solely on that tactic. Exorcists are frequently classes that have positive energy features, such as paladins, warpriests, and clerics with Anathema feats, who can still fight effectively when fight an enemy immune to their energy attacks."

    "the field medic": {
      "benefits": "The simplest type of healer is often primarily another class, but dabbles in Life magic. They have ways of combining their natural healing abilities with the Life sphere. They will usually have the Life sphere, and the Studied Healing feat. Healing is usually their secondary function in combat, so they only choose those Life sphere abilities that are of great assistance to them.

An unkillable soldier will frequently take the Life sphere with the Regeneration drawback, and Self-Renewal talent so they can heal during battle. Robustness is also a good alternative to Greater Healing for them, and Revitalize is often a good talent for them, often to the extent that they will take the Slow Recovery drawback, and couple it with Revitalize (taken twice) so they can have it running for most of their work day with only 2 or 3 castings."

    "the vivomancer": {
      "benefits": "The vivomancer is a powerful caster dedicated to Life magic. They are likely full-casters with limited martial abilities, and most of their actions in combat are dedicated to healing their allies and staying out of trouble themselves. They are likely have many Life sphere talents, often taking several levels of Greater Healing to be effective healers, Ranged Healing and Mass Healing so they can be effective and far away at the same time, and several restore talents. Vivomancers will often learn how to capitalize on their Life talents offensively with abilities such as Disruption to give themselves offensive options (especially early in battle, when there is little healing to do). If they have the means to invest heavily in another sphere, they might choose a sphere that will let them buff their allies further, such as Enhancement, Protection, or War. Alternatively, they might choose Conjuration so that they can conjure themselves a body guard."

    "the warlord": {
      "benefits": "The warlord is a preventive healer who is more interested in causing pain than relieving it. They are often highly skilled in invigorate abilities, often taking Deeper Invigorate. They will invigorate all allies before and after every battle, giving them huge pools of temporary hit points without having to spend time in combat tending to them, but some will even go as far as taking Ranging Healing and Mass Healing so they can refresh their allies' temporary hit points during the battle. They will often augment this with vitality feats and feats that improve their ability to heal during battle."

    "bright light": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may cause one of your glow effects within medium range to shed bright light. This may be done as part of the same standard action used to cause that object to glow. This produces bright light for 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels, and increases the light level by one step to a maximum of normal for 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster level beyond this. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow the bright light to continue without concentration for 1 minute per caster level or until the glow effect expires, whichever comes first. The bright light produced by this effect is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by daylight, but it may affect creatures with light blindness or other conditions. Lens (Lens) effects allow a user of the Light sphere to bend or alter light and its properties. The caster may place a lens as a standard action on any target (or sometimes a space) within the same range as their glow. This requires a melee or ranged touch attack when used on unwilling targets, and is subject to spell resistance. A lens lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow a lens to remain for 1 hour per caster level without concentration. When you gain the Light sphere, you gain the following lens:"

    "telescope (lens)": {
      "benefits": "You give the target the ability to magnify incoming light, granting them a circumstance bonus to sight-based Perception checks equal to your casting ability modifier. In addition, the DC for the target's sight-based Perception checks increases by +1 per 50 ft. instead of +1 per 10 ft. In addition, the target may focus on a specific sight as a full-round action, making a Perception check as if intentionally searching for stimulus. The DC for that Perception check increases by +1 per 100 ft. instead of +1 per 10 ft. Light Talents"
    },
    "light": {
      "benefits": "Some talents are designated (light), which add additional effects to your glow ability. You may only apply the benefits of one (light) talent to any individual glow effect. While you may only apply one such talent to an individual glow effect, areas of bright light from different glow effects overlap, provided they are augmented by different (light) effects; an area cannot be affected by the same (light) effect from multiple sources simultaneously. When augmenting a glow effect with a (light) talent, the effect is applied once per round, at the end of the caster's turn. For example, if a glowing object is thrown into a large group of enemies, it would only affect those within the area where it landed, not those targets it passed by to arrive in that area."

    "nimbus": {
      "benefits": "Some Light talents are designated (nimbus), which notes a talent that alters the area of light shed by your glow effects, changing the area in which light is increased as well as where the effects of (light) talents are applied. You may only apply a single (nimbus) talent to a glow at a time but may switch between them and the normal area of your glow as a free action, though any (light) talents affect only one area in a round. Light Sphere Talents"

    "area glow": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create an eruption of light, causing all creatures and objects within a 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels radius centered within range to glow. You do not need to make a ranged touch attack against any creature within this area. You may only make a single target glow brightly as part of applying an area glow chosen after the targets are affected."

    "bend radiance": {
      "benefits": "You may bend the light produced by your glows, allowing you to create spaces untouched by their light. When you cause a glow to shed normal or bright light, you may choose a number of 5 ft. cubes in the area of light it produces, up to a maximum of one 5 ft. cube per odd caster level. These cubes do not need to be contiguous. The selected area is unaffected by your glow; its light level does not change, and it is not subject to the effects of any (light) talents applied to the glow. If the glow moves, this omitted area moves with it. You may alter what areas are affected and unaffected by your light as a free action."
    },
    "black light": {
      "benefits": "As a free action you may cause any glow within your range to shed non-visible light. While shedding non-visible light, a glow does not outline a creature with light, impose a Stealth penalty, or increase light levels within its radius. However, (light) talents applied to the glow still function as if it was shedding light in its normal area. A glow shedding non-visible light functions normally in even magical darkness and does not hinder the function of magical darkness in the same area. No magical skill check is made when a glow under the effects of Black Light interacts with magical darkness."
    },
    "dancing lights": {
      "benefits": "You may create a glow effect without the need for a creature or object. This allows you to create a floating ball of light that may fly up to 60 feet per round and may be directed as a free action. You may give these lights simple commands, such as following a creature you can see or traveling in a specified pattern."

    "doubled nimbus": {
      "benefits": "By increasing the casting time of your glow by one step or by spending a spell point you may apply two (nimbus) talents to a single glow effect, causing it to shed light in the area defined in both (nimbus) talents. Alternatively, you may choose to apply a single (nimbus) talent while also shedding light in the normal radius of your glow, or apply a single (nimbus) talent twice. Creatures in overlapping areas are still only affected by (light) talents and other effects of your glow once."
    },
    "dual light": {
      "benefits": "By spending a spell point you can simultaneously apply two (light) talents you possess to your glow. You may even apply the same (light) talent twice, though this is not always beneficial. The effects of each talent is resolved separately. If the (light) talents you apply have spell point costs each cost must be paid, although other costs (such as for metamagic or maintaining bright light without concentration) are only incurred once. This talent may not be used in conjunction with the Daylight advanced talent."
    },
    "flare": {
      "benefits": "As a swift action you can expend one of your glow effects within range of your glow ability, causing it to blaze up momentarily before dying completely, ending the effect. The target of the glow effect takes 1d4 untyped damage per odd caster level, while all creatures within 5 ft. of the target take half that damage. Affected creatures may attempt a Reflex save for half damage. If the target of your glow is Large or larger, choose one of its squares and the secondary damage affects creatures within 5 ft. of that square."

    "flash": {
      "benefits": "You may choose to apply the effects of (light) talents at any point during your turn as a free action instead of only at the end of your turn. You may still only apply the effects of (light) talents once per round. As a swift action you may spend a spell point to apply the effects of a (light) talent an additional time in a single round. This additional application may be activated separately from any other application of your (light) talents. This allows your (light) talent to affect a different area if the glow has moved or the area of its light has changed, but does not let you affect any given area more than once per round."

    "glory": {
      "benefits": "As a free action you may cause any glow placed on yourself or an item in your possession to shed bright light in a 5 ft. radius, activating the effects of (light) talents and other abilities that require bright light. You do not need to concentrate to maintain this smaller area of bright light, nor do you need to spend a spell point. You may still follow the normal rules for causing your glow effects to shed bright light in order to shed bright light in a larger area. If you have multiple glow effects that could benefit from this talent, you may only cause one of them to shine bright light this way, but may switch which one Glory affects as a free action once per turn. An item that leaves your possession (such as by being thrown or disarmed) loses the benefits of this talent until you recover it."
    },
    "instill glow [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill a lens inside it, which functions as a potion or oil. You must spend a spell point to allow it to endure without concentration. You may also spend a spell point to create an instilled liquid that makes a target glow brightly, and can contain the effects of a single (light) talent you possess. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "intensity control": {
      "benefits": "You may add up to 10 ft. from the radius of your normal and bright light, as well as the distance to which light is increased by one step, or subtract any distance from the radius of your light. If you possess talents that would alter the area of your light such as the Illuminate talent, this increased or decreased radius is added in before the area is multiplied. You may alter the area of your light as a free action, but for the purpose of (light) talents you may only affect one area per round. Alternatively, so long as you do not apply any (light) talents to your glow, you may increase the radius of your normal light to 40 ft. and the radius of your bright light to 60 ft. + 5 ft. per caster level, and change the distance to which light is increased to the same amount. You may not alter the area of bright light shed by the Glory talent with Intensity Control."

    "light link": {
      "benefits": "You always know the direction and distance to any creature or object under the effect of your glow. This has no effect if the creature or object is on another plane."
    },
    "lingering glow": {
      "benefits": "When you cause one of your glow effects to shed bright light by concentrating on it, you may choose for it to continue shedding bright light for two rounds even after you stop concentrating."

    "mass lens [mass]": {
      "benefits": "When using a lens, you may spend an additional spell point to affect an additional 1 creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) with the same lens at the same time. Each target must be within range. While you may maintain concentration on each lens at the same time, each lens is considered a separate sphere effect. When spending a spell point to allow the lenses to endure without concentration, the duration of each lens is decreased by one step to 10 minutes per caster level."
    },
    "ranged light [range]": {
      "benefits": "You may target creatures and objects within long range rather than medium range when applying a glow or lens, and when causing a glow effect to shed normal or bright light."
    },
    "solar strike [strike]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with making a target glow. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also struck by the glow. If using a scatter weapon, the blast only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack."
    },
    "style": {
      "benefits": "Your glows may be composed of multiple colors, allowing you to outline or highlight specific portions of a glowing object or create art. When you cause your glow to shed light, you may also create patterns and different colors in the light it sheds, casting intricate designs on surfaces. These patterns may be highly detailed and complex, though creating art of high craftsmanship requires you to succeed on an appropriate Craft check, usually Craft (Art). You determine and create the pattern as part of making the glow or light, but may change it as a free action once per turn. As a standard action you can cause one of your glows that is shedding light to stain a surface with its light, painting its current pattern on any portion of the glow's area. The ability to stain a surface is an instantaneous effect, so the resulting stain is non-magical and functions as a mundane dye that cannot be dispelled, though it may be cleaned off or painted over. Unwilling targets may make a Reflex save to avoid being stained, and a 5 ft. cube may be cleaned of these stains with a full minute of work. If you also possess the Dancing Lights talent, you may alter the shape and appearance of your light. It may be as large as a full 5 ft. cube, or as small as a mote of dust, though its size has no impact on the light it sheds. Regardless of how intricate or well shaped your Dancing Light is, it is impossible to mistake as anything other than a magical light. Lens Talents"

    "aiming scope (lens)": {
      "benefits": "The target of this lens fires with more precision. They treat targets of their ranged attacks as being one range increment closer for all effects, such as when determining penalties for firing at a longer range. In addition, they gain a +1 competence bonus to all ranged attack rolls. For every ten caster levels you possess, the target ignores an additional range increment and their competence bonus to ranged attack rolls increases by 1."
    },
    "chameleon (lens)": {
      "benefits": "You can cause light and color to shift around a target, granting it the ability to blend in with its surroundings. The target gains a circumstance bonus to Stealth checks equal to your casting ability modifier. An object hidden in this way requires a Perception check to notice (DC 10 + the object's size modifier + your casting ability modifier). In addition, the target gains the ability to hide even while being observed, though the target must move no more than half its speed each round to use this benefit."
    },
    "dim light (lens)": {
      "benefits": "You cause a target to suffer no ill effects from light. The target of this (lens) talent is immune to the negative effects of your glows, including the effects of any (light) talents applied to them. It also gains no visibility related penalties from your glows, acting as if they did not exist in the area."
    },
    "halo effect (lens)": {
      "benefits": "You may place a lens upon a creature that subtly controls light around them. This is a powerful aid to communication, and can be used to communicate basic ideas and emotions to anyone who can see the creature. In addition, the creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Bluff and Diplomacy checks against creatures that can see them with conventional or low-light vision, with a +1 increase every 4 caster levels. At the GM's discretion, this bonus may also apply to certain types of Perform checks as well."
    },
    "infravision (lens)": {
      "benefits": "You may slightly shift the spectrum of light, granting the target the ability to see heat. This allows them to ignore the miss chance for less than total concealment on living creatures. In addition, the target is capable of tracking living creatures by the heat they leave in their tracks. So long as the trail is no more than an hour old, the ground condition is never treated as worse than soft ground (DC 10), though strong temperature conditions (such as winter snow or a desert noon) can negate this benefit."
    },
    "obscure (lens)": {
      "benefits": "You allow light to partially pass through your target and move in strange ways around them, making it difficult to perceive their exact position. Once per round when the target is attacked, but before the attack is rolled, they can choose to have the attacker roll twice and take the lower result. For every ten caster levels you possess you may cause this to happen an additional time per round. Opponents that rely solely on non-visual senses (such as blindsight) or that cannot see the target ignore this penalty."
    },
    "periscope (lens)": {
      "benefits": "By altering the path of light you can see from unusual positions. You may place and see from a sensor in any unoccupied space within your range that you can draw an unobstructed line to. This line may have one angle of up to 90 degrees, plus an additional angle of up to 90 degrees per ten caster levels you possess, but must otherwise be straight, and have a length no longer than the range of your (lens) talents. You may see from the position of the sensor as if you stood in the space it occupies. These sensors can be detected (Perception DC 20 + your caster level) and dispelled."
    },
    "rose-tinted (lens) [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "The target's vision is tinted a soft-red. As a standard action, the target of this lens may fire a blinding burst of light as either a 30-foot cone or 60-foot line centered on the target. Creatures caught in the area of effect must succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round, and dazzled for one minute. The target must wait at least 1d4 rounds between uses of this ability. When using this (lens) talent to fire a blinding burst, the target may end this (lens) talent as a free action to cause creatures who fail their Reflex saving throw to also take 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level. Light Talents"
    },
    "beacon of hope (light)": {
      "benefits": "When you place a glow effect on a creature, you may choose to grant that creature a +1 morale bonus on saves against fear. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels possessed. You may spend a spell point to create bright light that empowers those within it. All creatures within the area under the effect of a fear effect are allowed a new saving throw at the effect's original saving throw to end the effect, if one was originally given. So long as a creature is within this area of bright light, whenever they attempt a saving throw vs. a new fear effect, they may roll twice and take the better result."
    },
    "blinding light (light)": {
      "benefits": "When you cause a creature to glow, you may choose to make that target dazzled, giving it a -1 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks. You may spend a spell point to create bright light that blinds the glowing target and all creatures within the area of bright light. All creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. They must attempt this saving throw each round they are within this area. Creatures who succeed at their saving throw are still dazzled for that round."
    },
    "bound light (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create a bright light that binds the glowing target inside a prison of light. The target is entangled and must succeed at a Fortitude save each round or also be staggered for that round. In addition, the target must succeed at a magic skill check to use any form of dimensional travel, such as the dimension door spell or the teleport ability from the Warp sphere."
    },
    "disorienting patterns (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may create bright light that covers an area in confusing colors and designs. All squares in the area of this bright light become are considered difficult terrain, counting as two squares when determining how far a character moving through the area can move. By spending a spell point you can make the patterns of the bright light even more intricate and confusing. Each round a creature is within the area, it must make a Will save or fall prone. Blind creatures (or creatures that have closed their eyes) and creatures that do not rely on sight are immune to the effects of this talent."
    },
    "encompassing light (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create bright light that encompasses the glowing creature, allowing it to function as if it were larger than it is. The glowing creature deals damage and gains reach as if it were 1 size category larger than it is. This improves by one size category for every 10 caster levels possessed."
    },
    "fenestrate (light)": {
      "benefits": "You can create bright light that makes everything and everyone within the area of the bright light translucent enough that they can be seen through. This includes creatures, objects, structures, and even the ground itself. Objects are not invisible, however, and seeing through them is difficult. Objects that grant cover still grant concealment, but any creature using such an object to hide receives a -10 penalty to their Stealth. Magical fog effects are countered by this Light talent the way magical darkness can be countered by Light talents. Effects based on light (such as most Light sphere abilities) can pass through to affect other objects, but other effects are still stopped by solid objects. This light can be placed on a single structure to make it translucent. If the structure is larger than the area of the glow, then only part of the structure is made translucent."
    },
    "flicker (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may create bright light that partially assimilates a glowing creature, allowing them to momentarily shed their physical form. A creature under this effect can choose to move through solid objects as long as there are no factors that block normal sight (such as concealment from darkness or fog). This allows them to pass through transparent barriers like glass or through impossibly small gaps (such as a keyhole)."
    },
    "guiding light (light)": {
      "benefits": "When you cause a creature to glow, you may choose to grant all creatures a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against that target, +1 per 10 caster levels. When causing that creature to shed bright light, you may increase this bonus to +2, +1 per 5 caster levels. This has no effect on other creatures within the area of bright light."
    },
    "hypnotic pattern (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point when creating bright light to fascinate creatures. All creatures within this area of bright light that can see become fascinated (Will negates) for as long as they remain within this area of bright light. These targets take no action on their turn but to stare into the light, and suffer a -4 penalty to all Perception checks. A target is allowed a new saving throw each round to throw off the effect, and on a successful save, may make their actions as normal. Once a target has saved against this effect, they are immune to the effect for the rest of its duration. Hostile action taken against a hypnotized target automatically breaks the effect, as if the target had succeeded at their saving throw. If the target was already in combat when this ability is used, they gain a +2 bonus to their initial saving throw."
    },
    "inner sun (light)": {
      "benefits": "You grant a creature that you have caused to glow brightly a weapon of light they may wield as a weapon. The weapon can be shaped into any melee weapon the holder is proficient with as a swift action, and initially appears as whatever weapon they choose. On a hit, this does an additional 1d4 fire damage + 1d4 damage for every 4 caster levels that you possess. The weapon can not harm invisible or translucent enemies or structures, and passes through them harmlessly, possibly damaging things on the other side. Targets that are reflective such as a mirror have a 50% miss chance against attacks with this weapon. If the creature deliberately lets go of the weapon, it disappears, but otherwise the creature can not be disarmed. You may target a weapon to grant it this additional fire damage, as if it were a weapon of light. This extra damage is subject to the same restrictions as a weapon of light (does not affect invisibile or translucent targets, 50% chance of not affecting reflective creatures)."
    },
    "irradiance (light)": {
      "benefits": "Your glow sheds ionizing radiation along with visible light. When you cause a target to glow you may choose to make it sickened, giving it a -2 penalty to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. By spending a spell point to create bright light you can increase the intensity of the radiation. All creatures in the area of this bright light must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for one round. They must make this saving throw each round they are within this area. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw are still sickened for that round."
    },
    "lure light (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an area of bright light that lures creatures towards it. All creatures in the area of your light must make a Will save or be compelled to move towards the source of the glow on their turns. An affected creature capable of movement must make at least one move action towards the source of the glow each turn, and cannot intentionally move away from it unless they must backtrack to get closer to it. A creature may attempt a new Will save each turn they are in the light of the glow, and after successfully saving once they are immune to your use of this talent for 24 hours. If a creature is in the area of multiple Lure Lights, they move towards the closest, or towards the glow of their choice if they are equidistant. A creature will not intentionally harm themselves when moving towards a lure. They will not throw themselves off cliffs or into lava to pursue a glow, though they will move as close as possible without risking themselves. The effect of this (light) talent is considered a mind-affecting effect."
    },
    "precious (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create bright light on an object 2 or more sizes smaller than yourself, that compels those who see it to try and acquire it. Those who see the targeted object spend their turn frantically trying to acquire the precious object. They will not automatically become violent, and affected creatures will not attempt to acquire the precious object if attempting to do so would be obviously fatal, would inflict serious injury upon them, or be against their alignment or nature. They will not ignore enemies either, but their priority will be to acquire the precious object. They will try to acquire the object by direct and immediate means (not by bribery) and they will not stop just because they lose sight of the object. A creature might attack someone to acquire the object, but only if it is someone they might consider attacking anyways, and most likely they will try to grab the object and run rather than fight in a prolonged conflict. If the creature manages to acquire the precious object, they hold it in their hands and admire it as a standard action on their turn, doing whatever is required to keep it other than letting it go. Each creature gets a Will save to negate the effect when they first see the precious object, and a new save whenever they spend a standard action admiring the object. You are immune to this effect, but your allies are not. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect."
    },
    "purifying light (light) [crimdan]": {
      "benefits": "When you cause a creature to glow, you can help eradicate toxic substances they are afflicted with, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus on all Fortitude saves against poisons and diseases, increasing by 1 for every 10 caster levels. When you cause an object to glow, as an instantaneous effect you may purify rotten, diseased or poisonous food and drink, causing it to become suitable for consumption. This has no effect on magical diseases or poisons. You may spend a spell point to create a light of purification. Creatures within the area of the bright light gain a +2 circumstance bonus on saves against contracting new diseases and against the application of new poisons, increasing by 1 for every 4 caster levels. Additionally, as long as a creature currently suffering from a disease or poison stays within the bright light, all diseases and poisons currently active on them are suppressed, and any penalties bestowed by the disease no longer affect the creature, although this does not remove any ability damage, drain or negative levels the disease already bestowed. This does not stop the spread of diseases or poisons, nor makes creatures immune to them, but simply prevents the application of new effects they would suffer from additional saving throws."
    },
    "repelling light (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create light that repels unwanted creatures. Choose one creature type. In the case of humanoids and outsiders, you must instead choose one subtype. Any creature of this type or subtype within the area of bright light must succeed at a Fortitude save or be unable to move closer to the source of the light. Affected creatures may move sideways or backwards, but cannot move closer, although the source of the light may move closer to them. Creatures who succeed at their saving throw but remain within the area of bright light must attempt a new saving throw every round to avoid being affected. If a creature enters this area of bright light (or if the source of bright light moves close to them), they must immediately save or be affected."
    },
    "revealing light (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create bright light that reveals all invisible creatures and objects. These creatures and objects lose all the benefits of invisibility for as long as they are within the area of bright light."
    },
    "revelation (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may place a glow on a source of written information, such as a book, to cause it to reveal any information deliberately recorded in it. Anyone who takes even a moment to examine the light (a free action) can read the entire body of work, regardless of length, damage to the text or language barriers - the observer does not even need to be able to read. Even erased text can be read. If information is recorded with a magical protection that prevents detection or understanding, the caster may attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of the caster to determine if the information can be detected or understood. Once absorbed, the information can be retained as reading any other book can, and for a period of 1 hour after reading, the information remains especially clear. During this time, any creature attempting a Knowledge check on a topic relevant to the written work receives a +2 circumstance bonus to the check, with +1 increase every 4 caster levels. This ability may be used on objects with no visible writing, in order to reveal hidden messages. The light can allow a person to read a magical scroll, but does not necessarily allow them to cast or copy it. Observing the light does not trigger magical effects that occur in response to an object being read."

    "searing light (light)": {
      "benefits": "You may create bright light that burns targets in its area. All creatures in the area suffer 1 point of fire damage per caster level per round they are within this area of bright light. Undead, oozes, and creatures harmed by daylight take 2 points of fire damage per caster level. This does not affect the target of the glow itself. Creatures who have a glow placed directly upon them (or their equipment) augmented by the Searing Light talent may as a full-round action attempt a Reflex save to extinguish the bright light, causing the glow to shed only normal light for the remainder of the effect and preventing further damage caused by Searing Light."

      "benefits": "You may place a glow on a manufactured weapon, a piece of armor or a shield. When placed on a weapon, it does full damage to incorporeal creatures. If placed on a shield or piece of armor, you may apply its full bonus to AC against the melee attacks of incorporeal creatures. If you cause this glow to shed bright light, you can cause the glowing item to duplicate the effect of any single metal or material, chosen when this ability is used. The glowing object counts as a material for weaknesses and damage reduction, but is not otherwise that material."

      "benefits": "When you place a glow effect on a creature, you may choose to deal it 1d4 nonlethal damage per odd caster level. The creature takes this damage each round the glow is in effect. A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that round, while two consecutive Fortitude saves ends the effect. If you cause this glow to shed bright light, the target also becomes fatigued the next time they take nonlethal damage from this effect. If they are already fatigued, they instead become exhausted. This fatigue or exhaustion cannot be recovered from until the target has been healed of the nonlethal damage taken from this effect."

For normal light this creates a 10 ft. wide, 80 ft. long line, while bright light creates a 10 ft. wide line with a length of 120 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level. This also quadruples the distance to which light is increased one step to a maximum of normal light, creating a 20 ft. wide and 160 ft. long line of increased light for normal light, and a line of increased light for bright light that is 20 ft. wide and has a length of 240 ft. + 20 ft. per caster level. You may change the direction the line projects from the glow as a free action."

      "benefits": "When causing a glow effect to shed normal light or bright light, you may shape this light into strange shapes as a free action. It illuminates an area that you form of a number of 5 ft. cubes, with each cube placed adjacent to the target of the glow or another cube. For normal light you may place up to 20\u00a05 ft. cubes, and with bright light you may place up to 30, plus another for each 2 caster levels you possess. The light 20 ft. away from any square of this area (or 30 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 caster levels away if shedding bright light) is increased by one step to a maximum of normal. With the Intensity Control talent you may add an additional 5 ft. cube per 5 ft. of radius you would add to your area, and increase or decrease the radius in which light is increased by 10 ft. You may change the light's area or return it to its normal area as a free action, but for the purpose of (light) talents you may only affect one area per round.

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere (Flicker (light)), caster level 7th. Your Flicker talent becomes more nuanced and refined. Rather than allowing someone to simply turn into a single body of light, you give them the ability to split themselves into multiple reflections. When a creature under the effects of your Flicker takes a move action, they may choose to move in two separate directions and end their move in two different locations. When they take their next action or the next time they are attacked or targeted at one of these locations, whichever is sooner, they must decide which of these positions they are actually in."

    "everglow": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere (Lingering Glow), caster level 1st. By spending a spell point you can make a glow permanent, so long as it is not placed on an unwilling target. This also transfers control over the glow effect to anyone who holds the object, or the creature affected, allowing them to choose when to shed light or to simply glow. They may also turn the glow off completely as a move action, or turn it on again as a standard action. These permanent glows cannot be caused to shed bright light, and cannot have (light) talents applied to them. Any alterations of the glow's area or other qualities must be applied and determined when it is made permanent and cannot be changed; a permanent glow may only possess one unchangeable Style that cannot stain its surroundings, and may only have one (nimbus) talent applied, which cannot be changed after the glow is created, though the direction of talents such as Beam can be altered as a free action normally."

    "incarnate glow": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere (Flicker (light)), caster level 15th. When using the Flicker (light) talent, you can spend two spell points to more completely assimilate the target, turning them into a form composed of pure light. In addition to the normal effects of the Flicker talent, the target gains the following benefits: Immunity to nonmagical attack forms. Even when attacked with magical abilities and magic weapons, the target takes only half damage from any corporeal source. Corporeal effects that do not deal damage only have a 50% chance of working. Force effects work on the target normally, and the ghost touch special ability can affect the target as if it were incorporeal. \n The target loses any natural armor bonus it possesses, but gains a deflection bonus equal to your casting ability modifier. \n The target can move in any direction with its base land speed, effectively gaining a fly speed with perfect maneuverability. In addition, the target passes through water and operates in it as easily as it does in air, becomes weightless and cannot fall or take falling damage. \n The target moves silently and cannot be heard with Perception checks if it does not wish to be heard. Nonvisual senses such as scent or blindsight are ineffective in regards to the target."

    "light speed": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere (Flicker (light), Incarnate Glow (advanced)), caster level 15th. While a target is under the effects of Incarnate Glow, they can take advantage of their near-light state to move at much greater speeds. Whenever the target takes a move, run, withdraw or 5-foot step action, as long as they move in a straight line and there are no factors that block normal sight (such as concealment from darkness or fog), they may move five times the normal distance they would travel. In addition, the target may briefly move at light speed. This functions as a single run action, following the normal rules for run and movement, except the target may not pass through factors that block normal sight (such as concealment from darkness or fog), but may otherwise run 100 miles per caster level in a line as part of a single action. After taking this action, the glow and all its effects (including the effects of Flicker, Incarnate Glow, and Light Speed) immediately end."

    "constellation": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere (Dancing Lights), caster level 5th. By spending a spell point when you create a glow effect, you may cause it to take the form of a number of motes equal to your caster level. Each of these motes sheds normal light in a 5-foot radius, and light 5 feet beyond that is increased by one step to a maximum of normal. If you cause the glow to shed bright light, then they shed bright light in a 5-foot radius, and increase light 5 feet beyond that by one step to a maximum of normal. Each of these motes acts like a glow effect created with the Dancing Lights talent, except that you may direct and affect all of them as a single glow effect for all purposes. Overlapping areas of bright light from motes do not stack their effects for purposes other than increasing light level. Special: This is considered a (nimbus) effect. Unlike other (nimbus) effects, Constellation may only be applied when a glow effect is created, and you cannot switch to other (nimbus) talents once it has been applied."

Allies inside the radius of light shed by one of your souls do not suffer penalties from the dazzled condition. You may expend a soul to allow a creature inside the light shed by one of your souls to roll twice and take the better result when attempting an attack roll while blind. A soul expended this way lingers for 2 rounds, continuing to shed light but unable to be moved or expended a second time. If you possess the Dancing Lights talent, the fly speed of your souls increases to 60 feet. As a standard action, you may choose one of your souls to instead glow, as though under the effects of the Light sphere, and may attach a (light) talent to this glow, spending any spell points as required.

Benefit:  Whenever you use the Dark sphere darkness sphere effect, you may instead fill the area with twinkling starlight. This altered darkness effect is referred to as \"starlight darkness\". Instead of altering the area's light level, all creatures in a starlight darkness's area are dazzled. A Dark sphere effect modified by this feat is no longer dispelled by Light sphere effects and continues to function in areas with magical light. If you would create starlight darkness modified with the Dark sphere Pure Darkness (darkness) talent, instead of altering the area's light level, the penalties of the dazzled condition increase by +1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. If you would spend an additional spell point with the Dark sphere Pitch Black advanced talent, instead of altering the area's light level, the dazzled condition imposed by starlight darkness applies to all attack rolls, even if the creature does not rely on sight, can pinpoint their target through other means (such as blindsight), or would otherwise be immune to the dazzled condition. When creating starlight darkness, you may add a (light) talent instead of a (darkness) talent to the area. A (light) talent used with starlight darkness must be one that affects all creatures in the light's radius (such as Disorienting Patterns, Hypnotic Pattern, Searing Light, etc.) and has no additional effects for an individual target (even if attached to that target with Clinging Darkness). Starlight darkness with a (light) talent is treated as a glow effect for the purposes of a (light) talent's effects. Starlight darkness is otherwise a Dark sphere effect, and effects such as the Dark sphere Clearsight (meld) treat this effect as a normal (darkness) effect. You may spend a standard action to treat the starlight darkness as though it were an area of bright light or as part of the standard action used to create the starlight darkness, and functions as if it were bright light for the starlight darkness's duration. You must spend any additional spell points required when using a (light) talent with an area of starlight darkness."

Objects that grant cover still grant concealment, but any creature using such an object to hide receives a -10 penalty to their Stealth. Magical fog effects are countered by this Light talent the way magical darkness can be countered by Light talents. Effects based on light (such as most Light sphere abilities) can pass through to affect other objects, but other effects are still stopped by solid objects.

Those who see the targeted object spend their turn frantically trying to acquire the precious object. They will not automatically become violent, and affected creatures will not attempt to acquire the precious object if attempting to do so would be obviously fatal, would inflict serious injury upon them, or be against their alignment or nature. They will not ignore enemies either, but their priority will be to acquire the precious object. They will try to acquire the object by direct and immediate means (not by bribery) and they won't stop just if they lose sight of the object. A creature might attack someone to acquire the object, but only if it is someone they might consider attacking anyways, and most likely they will try to grab the object and run rather than fight in a prolonged conflict. If the creature manages to acquire the precious object, they hold it in their hands and admire it as a standard action on their turn, doing whatever is required to keep it other than letting it go. Each creature gets a Will save to negate the effect when they first see the precious object, and a new save whenever they spend a standard action admiring the object. You are immune to this effect, but your allies are not. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect."

Even erased text can be read. If information is recorded with a magical protection that prevents detection or understanding, the caster may make a Magic Skill Check against the Magic Skill Defence of the caster to determine if the information can be detected or understood. Once absorbed, the information can be retained as reading any other book can, and for a period of 1 hour after reading, the information remains especially clear. During this time, any creature making a knowledge check on a topic relevant to the written work receives a +2 circumstance bonus to the check, with +1 increase every 4 caster levels. This ability may be used on objects with no visible writing, in order to reveal hidden messages.

In addition, you can use this ability to duplicate the effect of any single metal or material, chosen when this ability is used.

    "spellburn": {
      "benefits": "You can damage a creature's capacity for power against a target. This attempt automatically fails against creatures that do not have at least 1 spell point. They are permitted a Will save to negate the effects, otherwise they suffer 1 spell point damage plus 1 per 10 caster levels you possess. You can spend an additional spell point as part of using this ability to also have the creature become spellburned. While spellburned, the creature must succeed at another Will save at the end of their turn for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier or suffer 1d2 spell point damage, increasing by one step for every 4 caster levels beyond 1st (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, etc.). On a success, the effect ends. If this expunge is used on a creature that is already spellburned, they immediately suffer the normal spell point damage, plus the amount of spell point damage they suffer each round due to being spellburned. Multiple instances of this expunge do not stack; use the highest caster level when determining the spell point damage. A creature may spend a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity to re-center their magic, ending the effects of this ability without making a save. Table: Spellburned Caster Level \n Burn Size \n \n \n 1st \n 1d2 \n \n \n 5th \n 1d3 \n \n \n 9th \n 1d4 \n \n \n 13th \n 1d6 \n \n \n 17th \n 1d8 \n \n \n 21st \n 2d6 Note:  The expunge ability is created with the intention of being used upon other spellcasters that utilize the Spheres of Power system of magic, but can be made to work with other systems of magic as well. When used against a spellcaster that utilizes the core system of magic in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a GM may allow it to damage spell slots or spells prepared. To calculate which spells are affected, total the number of spell point damage taken. The caster suffering from the spell point damage talent may then choose an amount of spell slots or prepared spells to lose. They must choose an amount of spells that amount to the points cost, following this list to determine the value of each spell level in spell points: Level 1-2:  1 spell point,  Level 3-5:  2 spell points,  Level 6-8:  3 spell points,  Level 9:  4 spell points. If there is an amount of spell points remaining that the spellcaster cannot sacrifice spells of a level to make up for without going above the amount (for example, only losing 1 spell point but not having any 1st or 2nd level spell slots/prepared spells left), they may ignore the remainder without sacrificing additional spell slots. When used on creatures with psionic manifesting (Psionics Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press), the creature loses a number of power points equal to the number of spell points that would have been lost multiplied by 1 + its Hit Dice/4. Manabond You can create a manabond between yourself and the targeted creature as either a swift action made as part of successfully using an (expunge) or (manipulation) talent that costs a spell point and targets a creature, or as a move action by touching a creature and spending a spell point. A manabond lasts for as long as you concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. You cannot create a manabond with yourself. Concentration on a manabond only requires a swift action, which cannot be further reduced unless otherwise specified. When creating a manabond, you may add a single (manabond) talent that you possess to the effect. When creating a manabond, you are considered the host of the manabond, and the target considered the recipient. You can only be the host of a single manabond, and cannot be the recipient of multiple manabonds at the same time. If a caster attempts to place a second manabond on a target, they must succeed at a magic skill check. If they succeed, the other manabond is suppressed, causing it to remain active and ongoing as long as it is maintained, but having no effect on the recipient until the suppressing manabond has ended. If they fail, their manabond is suppressed, and the original manabond remains active. Even when suppressed, a host may still pinpoint the location of the recipient. A manabond is a direct, invisible and intangible line of energy that connects the host and the recipient, and remains active up to close range, beyond which the manabond breaks, and the effect ends. You can always pinpoint your recipient's exact location (although this does not negate any concealment they may possess). When you gain the Mana sphere, you gain the following (manabond) talent:"

This bonus and penalty increases by 1 for every 8 caster levels you possess, and cannot reduce a creature's caster level below 1. Manipulation/Amp You learn to bend the rules of magic to your advantage. As a standard action, you may use any (manipulation) that you possess, up to a range of close. You must remain within this range when maintaining a (manipulation) through concentration. When you gain the Mana sphere, you gain the Shuffle manipulation. Some manipulations are also marked (amp). (Amp) talents modify the nature of a sphere effect as it is cast, or amplify the next sphere effect cast that it can apply to. (Amp) talents cannot modify sphere effects that are modified by metamagic feats, and likewise a sphere effect modified by an (amp) talent cannot be modified by a metamagic feat. Only a single (amp) may affect a sphere effect at any time; if multiple (amp) effects are used on a single sphere effect, the spherecaster creating the sphere effect must decide which functions. (Amp) talents may also not be affected by other (amp) talents, nor may metamagic feats be applied to them. Unless otherwise specified, you can activate (amp) talents as an immediate action made as part of creating a sphere effect that it can be applied to, acting as an extension to that sphere effect rather than creating two sphere effects. If you fail to cast the sphere effect, the (amp) is wasted and does not carry over to any other sphere effect you attempt to create. Alternatively, you can spend a standard action to allow a willing ally within range of your manipulate to gain the benefits of that (amp) talent on the next eligible sphere effect they cast before the start of your next turn. Some (amp) talents reduce an effect's caster level. If the caster level would be reduced to 0 or lower, the sphere effect fails and any spell points or actions spent are wasted. Any saving throws required by (amp) talents use your Mana sphere caster level, unless otherwise specified."

    "shuffle (manipulation)": {
      "benefits": "You may manipulate the rules of magic within a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels, centered anywhere within range, affecting all magical and supernatural effects cast within or that pass through the area for up to 1 round per caster level. You must concentrate to maintain this ability, but you may spend a spell point as a free action to allow the effect to persist without concentration for its maximum duration. The caster of an effect changed by this ability is allowed a Will Save to ignore the effects of Shuffle for that effect. Choose one of the following effects to apply to the area at the time of casting: Chaotic Rewiring:  By actively ruining magical cohesiveness in the area of your shuffle, magic becomes trickier to control. When a spherecaster targets one of their allies with a targeted sphere effect in the area of their shuffle, it instead randomly selects a target from all targetable allies within the area, even if they are otherwise out of range. If the spherecaster targets an enemy with a targeted sphere effect, it instead targets a random targetable enemy within the area. At 10th caster level, any sphere effect that targets a creature within the area of the shuffle randomly targets an enemy or ally within the area, regardless of the original target, as long as they would otherwise be able to be targeted. If the sphere effect targets an area centered within your shuffle, it instead randomly changes its targeted location to a nearby area 10 feet away from the original point it targeted in a random direction (roll 1d8 to determine, moving clockwise). This distance increases by 5 feet for every 4 caster levels you possess. \n Elemental Rewiring:  Choose two energy types from the following list: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You convert all energy damage of the first damage type into the second damage type. At 7th caster level, you add sonic to this list. At 12th caster level, you add force to this list. Only one shuffle can be in effect in an area at a time, with any attempt to overlap areas requiring a magic skill check against the MSD of the initial shuffle effect. On success, the initial shuffle effect is dispelled, but on a failure the shuffle effect fails to cast. Mana Talent Types Some talents are marked (expunge). These grant you additional ways to expunge energy. Some talents are marked (manipulation). These grant you additional ways of manipulating energy. Some manipulation talents are also marked (amp). These modify the nature of a sphere effect as it is cast, or amplifies the next sphere effect it can apply to. Some talents are marked (manabond). These grant you additional ways of using your manabonds. Mana Talents"

If the ability requires a magic skill check or attack roll, make a single roll and compare it to the magic skill defense or AC, respectively, of every creature affected. Otherwise, they each roll their save as normal. The caster is unaffected by this ability if they are within the area of effect. Even if you affect multiple creatures, you may only create a manabond with a single creature.

Additionally, you gain the following options: Focus Rewiring:  The area you manipulate greatly eases the use of magic. When a creature creates a sphere effect or uses a sphere-like ability within the area of your shuffle, they do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Additionally, all concentration checks made within the area of your shuffle are made with a +1 bonus, increasing by 1 for every 2 caster levels you possess. \n Spatial Rewiring:  The area you manipulate extends magical energy.

    "hardened bond": {
      "benefits": "When creating a manabond, you may spend a spell point to allow your manabond to manifest as a physical cord connecting yourself and the target creature, although you must have line of effect to the target. These physical bonds are tough, durable chains made of raw energy that inhibit movement. The two creatures connected by such a manabond cannot move further than the maximum range for the manabond without either destroying the tether (hardness equal to your caster level, hit points equal to twice your caster level + 5, AC 10), or by making a Strength check to burst it with a DC equal to your Mana sphere DC. Destroying the tether does not end the manabond, but does cause it to lose its physicality, removing any effects granted by this talent. When moving past the maximum range of the manabond, a creature affected by this talent may make a drag attempt as a free action made as part of any movement they make, allowing them to pull the creature in the direction they move, up to a maximum amount of distance determined by the drag attempt. The host of a hardened bond may use their caster level + their casting ability modifier in place of their combat maneuver bonus, and gain a bonus equal to twice their caster level to their combat maneuver defense on drag attempts made against them using the hardened bond. In addition, you may create shorter manabonds than normal. When creating one, they can be as short as 5 feet, or as long as your normal maximum range, but they must be measured in 5 feet increments. You can shorten or lengthen them as part of the action made to concentrate on them, although if the cord is not long enough to reach the target creature after shrinking it will break and end the effect."

      "benefits": "Whenever a creature fails their saving throw against your expunge or you succeed a magic skill check against a target using expunge, you can spend an additional spell point to further burden the caster for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. During this time, the target must spend 1 additional spell point whenever they cast a sphere effect or have the effect fail. For every 10 caster levels you possess, the amount of additional spell points the target must spend increases by 1."

You can create a manabond as a free action as part of casting another Mana sphere ability, creating multiple manabonds if the ability affects multiple creatures. You can also host multiple manabonds (but not benefit from being the recipient to multiple). Additionally, whenever you touch a creature to create a manabond, you may spend an additional spell point to touch an additional 1 creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1), creating a manabond with each one. When you spend a swift action to concentrate on a manabond, you count as if you were concentrating on all active manabonds you are the host of. You may also spend a spell point as part of creating a manabond to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration, although you may still activate effects that otherwise require concentrating on the manabond as a swift action."

If the target is struck by the attack, they are also struck by the (expunge) or (manipulation) talent. If using a scatter weapon, the chosen effect only applies to a single target, chosen before any attack rolls are made.

You may affect non-instantaneous sphere effects by spending an additional spell point as part of dismissing the manabond. When used in this way, your Mystical Bond can reduce the caster level of a sphere effect to below 1.

    "mark of instability (expunge)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to have the target become separated from their magic. The target is permitted a Fortitude save to resist this effect, otherwise they become unable to voluntarily spend spell points on any effect for 1 round, plus 1 round per 4 caster levels beyond 1st. This does not stop a target from using abilities that do not require a spell point to use, and can be used on creatures normally immune to Fortitude saves (such as undead and constructs). Creatures affected by this ability may attempt a new Fortitude saving throw as a standard action once each round to attempt to end its effects."

    "melt power (expunge) [archmagi's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You can destabilize a spherecaster's magic, rather than burn it away. This functions as per the base Spellburn expunge, save that the initial damage dealt increases to 1d4 + 1d4 per 10 caster levels you possess, and the spell point damage taken at the start of each turn increases by two steps (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 2d8, 3d6, etc.). Spell point damage from this effect always results in the loss of real spell points, and for each spell point lost due to this effect, the creature gains a temporary spell point that stacks with other spell points gained from this effect. If you use this expunge on a creature that is already spellburned due to this effect, but not due to the base Spellburn, they immediately suffer the normal spell point damage plus the amount of spell point damage they suffer each round due to being spellburned. A creature can spend a full-round action to attempt a Will save in order to convert all temporary spell points they have due to the effects of this talent back into real spell points. This also causes them to no longer be spellburned. At 10th caster level, the target only converts half of all temporary spell points they possess due to this talent into real spell points; they may choose to have the remainder be lost, or to keep them. If the target chooses to keep the temporary spell points, they cannot attempt to convert them to real spell points again. Note:  A creature can suffer from the spellburned effect from both this talent and the base Spellburn expunge. If a creature succeeds at a Will save to end the spellburned effect, they also end it for the other effect. This talent cannot be modified by the Deep Spellburn feat."

At the end of the target's next turn, they suffer 1 spell point damage for each temporary spell point they possess, and suffer 1d8 untyped damage for every spell point damage suffered (maximum 1d8 per caster level). If the target possessed temporary spell points that brought them above their normal maximum spell point total, the spell point damage and maximum amount of damage dealt by this talent are doubled (to a maximum of 2d8 per caster level). A creature affected by this talent is always aware of its effects. Alternatively, you may spend a spell point to destabilize a creature's heightened power unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. The target immediately suffers 2d6 untyped damage and 1 spell point damage for each caster level they possess above their Hit Dice with their highest caster level sphere, or the highest caster level sphere effect they have created in the past hour, whichever is higher.

Unwilling recipients are allowed a Will save to resist this. \n Sap:  The recipient suffers 1 spell point damage, and you gain 1 temporary spell point. Unwilling recipients are allowed a Will save to resist this. The target must actually lose spell points in order for you to gain temporary spell points. You may choose to pay any spell point costs that the recipient may incur from using their abilities with your own spell points, either partially or in whole.

If you or a willing recipient is targeted by a single-targeted harmless effect, you may redirect the effect to yourself or the recipient as a free action that can be taken outside of your turn.

Additionally, whenever you are magically healed any amount of hit points (except from sources such as fast healing, regeneration, etc.), you can redirect any amount of that healing to the recipient as a free action that can be taken outside of your turn. Due to the healing being redirected, the healing is still limited by effects that would limit the original healing (such as not being able to heal creatures above half health, or used to damage creatures that are usually damaged by the received healing."

Stretched Spell (amp):  You can amplify a sphere effect's range, treating your caster level as if it were 4 higher, increasing by 1 for every 4 caster levels you possess, when calculating the maximum range of that sphere effect. When using this amplification, you can spend a spell point to treat yourself as if you had possessed the range talent for the amplified sphere effect's sphere (or as if you had taken the range talent an additional time, if you already possess it), rather than increasing your caster level. \n Shapeshifted Spell (amp):  By spending a spell point, you can amplify a sphere effect that affects either a line-shaped area, or a cone-shaped area. If the sphere effect affects a line, it instead affects a cone half as long as the original shape (maximum 60 feet). If the sphere effect affects a cone, it instead takes the shape of a line twice as long as the original shape (maximum 120 feet). Alternatively, you can change a sphere effect that affects a line or cone to instead affect a 10-foot radius, +5 feet per 5 caster levels you possess, centered on you.

On a failure, the magic effect excludes the target from its effects, otherwise functioning normally. \n Physical Barrier:  The next time the target is attacked by a weapon attack, the attacker must succeed at a magic skill check against your magic skill defense. The attacker may substitute their CR (or total hit dice, if they possess no racial hit dice) for their MSB on this check. On a failure, the attack is deflected. This effect triggers before an attack roll is made. Whenever a barrier deflects an attack or prevents a magical effect from affecting the target, the barrier loses that layer.

If the effect has a duration greater than 1 minute and at least half its original duration remaining, you gain temporary spell points equal to half the effect's cost in spell points (minimum 0). You gain no spell points if the effect cost no spell points or was cast using temporary spell points (even partially), or if the effect had targeted multiple creatures. At 10th caster level, you instead gain temporary spell points equal to its full cost, but only if the duration was greater than 1 hour and had at least half its original duration remaining. You can target yourself with this ability as a swift action. Attempting to target an unwilling creature requires you to succeed at a magic skill check against the effect with a -2 penalty. On a failure, you cannot attempt to essentialize the effect again for 24 hours. When utilized this way, Essentialize functions as a counterspell attempt and the magic skill check gains any bonuses you might have to counterspelling. Note:  In order for Essentialize to function, it must completely end any ongoing effects created as part of a sphere ability. If a sphere ability provides an ongoing effect to multiple creatures, Essentialize cannot grant temporary spell points.

The damage dealt is of the same type(s) as the amplified sphere effect. \n Forceful Spell (amp):  You may spend a spell point to amplify a sphere effect that deals force damage. For each creature that suffers damage, make a trip attempt as a free action. You are not knocked prone if you fail this trip attempt by 10 or more.

      "benefits": "You may manipulate your own well of magic and transfer your capacity partially into a targeted creature. If the target is unwilling, they may attempt a Will save to resist this effect. For a number of rounds equal to your caster level, that creature acts as a vessel for your magic. When you cast a sphere effect (other than a sphere effect with the strike descriptor), you may choose to have the target of this talent act as the point of origin for all purposes, although you must still have line of sight as normal. Sphere effects that require a melee attack cannot be used through an unwilling target, unless it targets the vessel. Each round, an unwilling creature may spend a standard action to attempt a new saving throw to end this effect. You may not use this ability if the target creature is out of your manipulation range. While utilizing a sphere effect through a willing vessel, both you and the target of this talent provoke attacks of opportunity due to casting if any, and you must attempt concentration checks as normal if either you or the target is struck (attempt two concentration checks if both are struck). If the target is willing, you may allow them to make any melee touch attacks (unless it is a weapon attack) required to cast your sphere effect in your stead.

Apprentice's Spell (amp):  You can spend a spell point to allow a spherecaster to ignore one general drawback they possess when creating their next sphere effect, treating the sphere effect as if they did not possess it. For every 5 caster levels, you can pay 1 additional spell point to ignore an additional drawback. You may only allow the following general drawbacks to be ignored: Emotional Casting, Magical Signs, Material Casting, Mental Focus, Rigorous Concentration, Skilled Casting, Somatic Casting, Terrain Casting and Verbal Casting.  Note:  If you ignore a drawback that a drawback feat requires you to possess, you cannot apply the effects of that drawback feat to a sphere effect. Drawbacks that can be taken twice only ignore once instance, unless selected twice. \n Delayed Spell (amp):  You may spend a spell point to cause a sphere effect to be paused before it is initially activated. The amplified sphere effect does not immediately take effect, although it still emanates an aura as normal and you must still determine any targets or locations at the time of initially creating the effect. At any time within 1 minute per Mana caster level of creating the amplified sphere effect, the spherecaster who created it can spend a standard action to immediately trigger the effect. Otherwise, at the end of this time, the sphere effect activates normally. Only one sphere effect can be triggered with a standard action at a time, but a spherecaster may have as many delayed sphere effects as they can cast. You may tie the method of activation to a non-magical method (such as a specific lever being pulled, a specific keyword being spoken or a symbol being gestured) to allow other creatures to activate the magic, but such a method must be simple and be able to be purposefully activated by any creature, and still must require at least a standard action to perform, and may only cause one delayed effect to activate at a time."

These squares are excluded from the sphere effect's area. \n Avoidant Spell (amp):  You can spend a spell point to modify a sphere effect that affects an area. Choose one creature, plus an additional creature for every 5 caster levels. These creatures automatically succeed any saving throws they must attempt against the amplified sphere effect, and do not suffer any damage, ability damage, ability drain or negative levels the effect may bestow. \n Dismissable Spell (amp):  You can amplify a sphere effect with a duration longer than instantaneous to allow it to be easily dismissed. The spherecaster who creates the amplified sphere effect can dismiss the sphere effect as an immediate action. You may tie the method of dismissal to a non-magical method (such as a specific lever being pulled, a specific keyword being spoken or a symbol being gestured) to allow other creatures to dismiss the magic, but such a method must be simple and be able to be purposefully activated by any creature and still requires at least an immediate action to perform.

Stable Spell (amp):  You may amplify any sphere effect that deals damage or heals hit point or ability damage using d4's or dice of a larger size. Treat any 1's rolled with that sphere effect as if they were 2's. If your caster level is at least 10, you may treat all 1's and 2's as 3's. You may spend an additional spell point to heighten this effect, treating all 1's, 2's and 3's as if they were 4's at 20th caster level, or all 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's as if they were 5's at 30th caster level. This cannot cause a dice roll to be treated as higher than the maximum possible roll on the dice. Sphere effects that do not roll for damage (such as by taking the minimum possible roll) are not affected by this (amp). \n Split-drain Spell (amp):  You may amplify any instantaneous sphere effect that you create that deals damage by spending 1 spell point. The sphere effect only deals 75% of its damage (rounded down), but heals you for the remaining 25% of the sphere effect's damage. At 10th caster level, you may have the sphere effect deal only 50% of its damage in order to heal for the remaining 50% damage. Only any initial damage is affected by this (amp); lingering damage is not reduced but does not heal you.  Note:  This (amp) determines its effects at the time of creating the sphere effect; for example, if you would create a destructive blast modified by Explosive Orb and would deal 40 damage, you instead deal 30 damage and heal for 10 damage, regardless of how many creatures would be affected by the sphere effect. \n Severed Spell (amp):  You may amplify any sphere effect that targets a single creature and deals damage. You may reduce the sphere effect's damage by up to 90% (in 10% increments) to redirect the remaining damage to one other creature that would have been a valid target for the sphere effect. Only damage is redirected; any other effects from the sphere effect only affect the primary target. If the sphere effect requires an attack roll or saving throw, you must succeed at an attack roll against the second target, or they must attempt a saving throw against the sphere effect as if they were the primary target in order to be affected."

      "benefits": "As a swift action, you can manipulate the magic of a harmless sphere effect with a non-instantaneous duration that only affects you, granting any amount of creatures within your natural reach its effects. Doing so ends the effect and divides the remaining duration of the effect across all affected creatures. The duration must be divided in the same increments the effect's duration was granted in (for example, an aegis must be divided in 1 hour increments). This talent can only be used to relinquish effects within 1 round of the effect's creation. You can spend a spell point to transfer non-harmless effects on creatures, requiring a successful magic skill check against the creature, and a Will saving throw if unwilling. This talent cannot be used on curse effects. If you possess Ranged Mana, you may grant the effects of the manipulated magic to creatures within your manipulation range, rather than your natural reach. Note:  Similar to Essentialize, Relinquish must completely end an ongoing effect as it was created in order to function. If the sphere ability provides an ongoing effect to multiple creatures, Relinquish cannot be used to divide it up further. Likewise, effects that can be partially used such as the Mystic Shell aegis of the Protection sphere can only function with Relinquish if it has not been used (i.e all layers must still be remaining). Sphere effects created through Relinquish must be able to affect their target to be granted, and cannot be used on abilities that could only target the sphere caster that created them."

Creatures that fail their saving throw against the amplified sphere effect are marked for 1 minute (for sphere effects with multiple saves, only the initial saving throw counts). Further uses of an identical sphere effect that use this (amp) increases the amount of marks by one and refreshes the duration of all marks to 1 minute. Marked creatures take a -1 penalty to saving throws per mark on them against further uses of the same identical sphere effect. A creature can be marked twice, plus one additional time at 6th caster level and every 6 caster levels thereafter.  Note:  Identical sphere effects for the purposes of this (amp) are any sphere effects that use the exact same makeup of talents and feats, with the exception of any (amp) or metamagic feats used, to create the effect, with no additional modifications. Other decisions such as optional spell points being spent, or a choice between several effects a single talent may impose do not need to be the same (for example, a talent that bestows a curse could bestow a different curse each time). Marks are unique to spherecasters; you cannot utilize marks bestowed by another sphrecaster, even if you use an identical sphere effect. \n Reinforced Spell (amp):  You may amplify any sphere effect that can be resisted by spell resistance by spending a spell point. The spherecaster who created the sphere effect gains a +2 bonus on all magic skill checks made to overcome spell resistance with the amplified sphere effect, increasing by 2 at 10th caster level and every 10 caster levels thereafter. Bonuses from this (amp) do not stack with the bonuses from the Spell Penetration or Greater Spell Penetration feats. \n Durable Spell (amp):  You may amplify any sphere effect by spending a spell point.

After the target uses a sphere effect that costs at least 1 spell point, all granted temporary spell points are removed, even if the effect did not use all of them. Alternatively, you may spend a spell point as a standard action to grant your target a normal spell point (Will negates if unwilling). You may grant spell points to creatures that do not possess a spell pool, temporarily granting them access to a spell pool for as long as the granted spell points last (or until you next rest to regain spell points if they are not temporary). Note:  Occasionally, a setting might have different sources of magic that are mutually incompatible, or a GM might wish to seperate how magic can be transferred across characters. In games like this, the GM may be encouraged to add restrictions to how the Transfer and Flow talents can be used. For example, they might rule that an arcane caster cannot grant spell points to a divine caster, or that spherecasters of a specific tradition cannot grant spell points to any other tradition. GMs are encouraged to examine how magic works in their games and arbitrate what, if any, limits on transferring magic might exist."

The first time a creature witnesses the sphere effect, they must succeed at a Will save against your Mana sphere DC or be fascinated for the duration of the sphere effect, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level of the amplified sphere effect. If the sphere effect was instantaneous, they are only fascinated for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. Creatures directly harmed by the sphere effect automatically succeed their saving throw. \n Falsified Spell (amp):  You can amplify any sphere effect with obvious visual indicators that either targets a creature or an area by spending a spell point. The sphere effect is obscured against potential sensory mechanisms. Creatures that are unaffected by the amplified sphere effect (including creatures that were targeted or in the sphere effect's area) must succeed at a Perception check against a DC of 15 + your caster level or otherwise not notice that the sphere effect took place at all, such as by not perceiving healed wounds, noticing explosions or similar. This does not stop the creature from noticing that a spherecaster used magic, only the presence of magic itself. \n Illuminating Spell (amp):  You may amplify any sphere effect that targets an area. All squares affected by the sphere effect radiate light, increasing the light level up to normal light. If the amplified sphere effect was instantaneous, the light remains for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. If the area is already under the effect of another magical effect that changes light levels, the effects of this (amp) are suppressed. \n Shrouding Spell (amp):  You may amplify any sphere effect that targets an area. All unattended non-magical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, are extinguished and cannot be lit again while the sphere effect is maintained. Additionally, all squares affected by the sphere effect decrease their light level by one, to a minimum of dim light, for the duration of the amplified sphere effect, or one round if the sphere effect was instantaneous.

Damaging the spell points of creatures with less than half your magic skill bonus results in no spell points being drained, and you may only gain spell points up to the amount of spell points the target lost due to damage. Note:  Manathief is considered an advanced talent for its implications in worlds it exists in, but also its mechanical powers. As Manathief costs no spell points to use, and grants spell points to the caster, it's important to understand that this talent allows spherecasters to effectively replenish their reserves (for example, by capturing spherecasters and draining them of all the magic they can). A GM is advised to create limitations in what creatures they can drain spell points from, as well as how often they can from the same creature. For example, a spherecaster with the Conjuration sphere can create a Mage companion of which they can drain spell points from to fuel their power. Each GM should understand the possibilities of this ability, and limit it in such a way that it fits their world, and the power level they desire for their game."

    "manifestation [archmagi's hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mana sphere (Gift Of Knowledge, Limited Manifestation), at least 3 other spheres known, caster level 20th. At the peak of all magic, you have come to sit on its throne, capable of producing any effect imaginable. When you manifest magic, you may choose one of the following effects in place of the normal options of Limited Manifestation: Create any single sphere effect that can be produced from a combination of all the talents you already possess and any amount of magic talents you do not possess. For each talent you do not possess beyond the 5th, you must spend two additional spell points to manifest the sphere effect. At the GM's discretion, even advanced talents can be imitated through this, but each advanced talent you do not already possess counts as two basic magic talents when determining the cost. This option otherwise functions as the first option of Limited Manifestation. \n You may automatically undo the effects of any non-harmless sphere effect on a number of willing creatures equal to your caster level, although the undone effect must be the same on all creatures. \n You may automatically dispel any number of sphere effects with a magic skill defense equal to or lower than your magic skill bonus + 11 in a 30-foot radius, centered within your manipulation range. Additionally, you perform a complex version of Manifestation that requires 25,000 gp in materials to be consumed to create a more powerful effect, selected from the options below: Create any sphere effect with a duration greater than 24 hours. This functions as the basic use of Manifestation, save that it does not reduce the duration of the sphere effect; sphere effects with a permanent duration can only be selected with the GM's permission and may have an increased or lowered cost required in materials. \n You may attempt to create an unlisted magical effect, although such an effect should imitate the power and scale of the abilities presented above; attempting to manipulate the magic of the world to an even greater extent is possible, but is extremely dangerous and liable to produce unreliable effects. (Such effects can fail outright, or can even produce unwanted and dangerous effects, or imperfectly create the desired effect. The exact manifestation of the effect is at the GM's discretion.) Using this talent counts as if using wish or a similarly powerful magical effect. Note:  Manifestation is an extremely powerful advanced talent that is capable of producing almost any effect, even above the norm for other advanced talents. Extreme discretion should be used when allowing players to take this talent, and a player should always confirm with their GM before picking it, even if other advanced talents are normally fine."

    "runic magic (manipulation, amp) [archmagi's hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mana sphere, caster level 5th. You can modify magic in such a way that it understands language, and becomes more like a pact. Oathbreaker's Spell (amp):  You can spend two spell points to modify a non-harmless sphere effect so that it punishes those who break an agreement. As part of casting the amplified sphere effect, the spherecaster must select a target. The target of the amplified sphere effect must be willing, or else the amplification fails to modify the sphere effect. An agreement, written or verbal, must be struck between the target and the spherecaster that created the amplified effect. So long as the target abides by this agreement, the sphere effect does not take effect. If at any time the target violates the agreement, the sphere effect immediately triggers as if cast, targeting the creature who violated the contract or their current location if it does not target creatures. This ability recognizes the spirit of the agreement, and does not trigger the sphere effect if the agreement is violated unknowingly or unwillingly. The magical agreement only lasts for up to 1 day per caster level, after which the amplified spell is discharged harmlessly. At 15th caster level, the agreement may last for as long as the spherecaster desires, even indefinitely. The amplified sphere effect gains the (curse) descriptor. \n Contracted Spell (amp):  You can spend two spell points to modify a harmless sphere effect that targets one creature so that its benefits are tied to an agreement. As part of casting the amplified sphere effect, the spherecaster who created the sphere effect must strike a written or verbal agreement between themselves and the target of the amplified sphere effect must accept the conditions. This agreement can be a promise, a goal that must be achieved before the amplified sphere effect ends or a task to be repeated intermittently, or a warning to not commit a certain prohibited behavior. If the agreement is violated (or not completed in time), the amplified sphere effect immediately ends and all of its effects are reversed (even instantaneous effects; afflictions removed will return, hit points healed will be undone and so forth). This amplification understands the spirit of the agreement, and will not consider it a violation if the target unwillingly or unknowingly violates the agreement. The target always knows if a specific action they take will trigger a violation of the agreement. The magical agreement lasts for as long as the amplified sphere effect, or up to 1 day per caster level if the sphere effect had a duration of instantaneous. At 15th caster level, the magical agreement may last for as long as the spherecaster desires, even indefinitely. \n Written Spell (amp):  You can spend a spell point to convert an instantaneous sphere effect that targets either one creature or an area and allows for a saving throw to avoid its effects into magical writing. The sphere effect remains dormant and does not trigger until a creature approaches its range and reads the magical writing, where it then activates, targeting the creature that read it or their square. Only one piece of magical writing can be written on a surface or parchment, and a creature can only trigger one magical writing each turn. You can instruct creatures on how to read the magical writing without triggering it as a standard action. The magical writing remains for 1 day per caster level but the spherecaster who created the sphere effect cannot regain any spell points spent on the sphere effect until it triggers. The writing is treated as a magical trap and may be disabled with Disable Device check (DC = 10 + the spherecaster's caster level + the spherecaster's casting ability modifier). Both you and the spherecaster who created the effect can remove and dispel the writing as a standard action without a check. At 15th caster level, the magical writing remains indefinitely or until removed."

When using shuffle, you gain the following options, but only if you possess the required sphere for that option. Aggressive Rewiring (War sphere):  You can bolster or obstruct projectile magic in the area you manipulate. When you use this Shuffle option, you must select whether to bolster or hinder magic. If you bolster, all attack rolls made as part of a sphere effect or supernatural effect affected by the shuffle resolve as touch attacks. If a sphere effect would already require a touch attack, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. If you choose to hinder, all attack rolls made as part of a sphere effect or supernatural effect resolve as a regular attack roll. If a sphere effect would already require a regular attack roll, it suffers a -2 penalty to the attack roll. The bonus and penalty both increase by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. This ability only affects attacks made as part of a sphere effect that are not weapon attacks (such as through talents with the strike descriptor), other than ray attacks. \n Distance Rewiring (Warp sphere):  Magic entering the area you manipulate can quickly travel across large distances, even if it would otherwise be out of reach. Any sphere effect or sphere-like effect that can affect an area or that targets a creature that reaches into the area of the shuffle treats the entire area of the shuffle as well as any creatures within the area as if they were within the sphere effect's range, effectively extending the range of the sphere effect. Effects with a range of touch can be performed against any creature within the shuffle as long as the spherecaster is within the area, even if they would otherwise be out of reach. Utilizing such an effect requires a touch attack on unwilling targets. This ability only affects touch attacks made as part of a sphere effect that are not weapon attacks (such as through talents with the strike descriptor). \n Destined Rewiring (Fate sphere):  You manipulate the alignments that spells detect within the area you manipulate. Upon using this option, you must choose a single alignment from the alignment spectrum. All creatures within the area of your shuffle are considered to be of that alignment for the purpose of any sphere effects or supernatural effects that target or affect creatures within the area.

You may apply the effects of the following abilities to any manabond you create if you possess the associated sphere or talent. Protection sphere:  Recipients of your manabonds are considered as if they were under the effects of your aegis for the purposes of effects such as the Community and Status talents. \n Mind sphere (Project Thoughts):  All recipients of your manabonds may communicate telepathically with you and any other recipient of your manabonds. \n War sphere:  You may rally recipients of your manabond as if they were within range of one of your totems. \n Life sphere (Diagnose):  Instead of a swift action, you may spend a free action to learn the condition of all recipients of your manabond. You may spend a spell point once per turn as a free action to learn the exact details of these conditions, as per the Diagnose talent. If you also possess the Soulmate talent, you may always redirect healing as per the talent when you have an active manabond with a creature, even if it is not a Soulmate manabond. Archetypes Specializing in Mana \n Arcanopulser  [CS] \n Arcanopulsers are Elementalists who specialize in mana blasts. \n Corteggiare \n Corteggiare are Bards who are particularly good at blending magic into their music. \n Spellvampire \n Spellvampires are Shifters who can steal the magic and powers of their foes. \n \n Wild Magic \n Wild Magic Generator \n \n Wild Magic Table \n \n \n d100 \n Result \n \n \n 1 \n The caster becomes blind, but gains 60 feet blindsight that can only be used to see creatures that can store spell points, as well as any magical effects, terrain or items. This lasts for 1 hour. \n \n \n 2 \n The caster's target (if any) can always sense the location of the caster for 1 hour per caster level. \n \n \n 3 \n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of their choice from any sphere they qualify for for 1 round. \n \n \n 4 \n A flux of magic enhances all effects. An area of potent magic is created in a 20-foot radius around the caster, which remains for 24 hours. Any effects cast within this radius are treated as if any variable components rolled their maximum possible number. \n \n \n 5 \n Mana becomes as clear as light. You detect magic constantly as the base Divination sphere ability for 1 hour per caster level, and any attempt to identify magic items or effects with a Spellcraft check are treated as if you rolled a natural 20 on the check. \n \n \n 6 \n Until the end of the caster's next turn, all spell point costs the caster must pay are waived. \n \n \n 7 \n Magic becomes obvious. Any creature being targeted by a magical effect within close range of the caster automatically knows the type of effect and the source of the effect. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 8 \n Antimagic bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid antimagic, removing 1 spell point from any creature that walks into it (or applying a -1 penalty to a random mental ability score if they do not have spell points), but granting them a +2 bonus to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 9 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 10 \n Your manabonds fuse incredibly easily. You may create a manabond as a free action to any creature within close range until the end of your next turn. Unwilling creatures get a Will save to resist this. \n \n \n 11 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 12 \n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls are ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 13 \n The effect's spell point cost is reduced to 0. \n \n \n 14 \n Power becomes absolute. All penalties or bonuses to caster levels, magic skill bonuses and magic skill defenses are negated in a close range radius around you. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 15 \n In a medium range, the weather immediately shifts 1d4 severity levels higher for Precipitation, but the clouds instead rain bright blue globs of mana. If the severity level is at least 4, each round the caster is exposed to the skies, they have a 5% chance of being struck by electrical mana, dealing 1d6 electric damage per caster level, but granting them 1 spell point per 2 caster levels. This lasts until the caster is struck once, or for 1 hour. \n \n \n 16 \n The effect is modified by a metamagic feat of the caster's choosing, though they spend 1 additional spell point in the effect in addition to the extra cost of the metamagic feat. The caster may only select metamagic feats they do not possess. \n \n \n 17 \n The caster's target is stunned for 1 round. Fortitude negates. \n \n \n 18 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 19 \n The caster is fatigued. If they were already fatigued, they are exhausted. \n \n \n 20 \n Until the end of the caster's next turn, all spell point costs the caster must pay are waived. \n \n \n 21 \n The next spell cast within close range of the caster automatically targets the caster, regardless of its maximum range or intended target. This lasts for 1 hour, or until a spell is redirected to the caster. \n \n \n 22 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 23 \n The caster becomes blind, but gains 60 feet blindsight that can only be used to see creatures that can store spell points, as well as any magical effects, terrain or items. This lasts for 1 hour. \n \n \n 24 \n Mana bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round, there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with a 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid mana, granting any creature that walks into it 1 spell point, but bestowing a -2 penalty to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 25 \n Suffer a -2 penalty to your caster level for 1 day, or until another creature grants a spell point to you, whether temporary or not. \n \n \n 26 \n Your mana imprints to the floor. A permanent sigil spreading around a 15-foot radius around you is engraved into the floor. Any casters utilizing sphere effects on top of this sigil gain a +2 bonus to their caster level. \n \n \n 27 \n The effect is fully paid by tomorrow's energy. The sphere effect costs no spell points to cast, but the next time the spellcaster gains spell points, they subtract the amount of spell points they would have spent. \n \n \n 28 \n You strain your body, using your vitality by mistake. Instead of paying the spell point cost for this sphere effect, you instead take 1 Constitution drain for each spell point you would have spent (minimum 1). \n \n \n 29 \n Your magic takes a life of its own - and it does not appreciate your use. The spell effect gains life, as the Bestow Magic Life advanced talent (see the  Enhancement  sphere) and is not cast normally, instead remaining for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. It begins with an attitude initially hostile against you, and will utilize its powers to inhibit the caster for as long as it lives (including using its ability to cast sphere effects on the caster, or to grant spell points to enemies). As long as this creature lives, you cannot make use of the Mana sphere. \n \n \n 30 \n You confuse yourself, temporarily forgetting how to use your magic. You suffer from the Mark Of Incompetency talent, using your level as its caster level. Randomly determine the drawbacks you gain. \n \n \n 31 \n Mana bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round, there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with a 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid mana, granting any creature that walks into it 1 spell point, but bestowing a -2 penalty to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 32 \n The caster's body becomes transparent for 24 hours, granting them a +5 bonus on Stealth checks as long as they do not wear any clothing and do not hold or carry any items (including backpacks). \n \n \n 33 \n You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level for 1 hour. You may not lower this spell resistance. \n \n \n 34 \n For 1 minute, all magic items within long range of the caster shed light as a torch. \n \n \n 35 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 36 \n Antimagic bleeds from the world's leylines. Each round there is a 25% chance that a random adjacent tile to the caster (roll a 1d8 to determine the tile, with 1 being north and rotating clockwise) is splashed with liquid antimagic, removing 1 spell point from any creature that walks into it (or applying a -1 penalty to a random mental ability score if they do not have spell points), but granting them a +2 bonus to all saving throws they attempt against magic for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 37 \n For 1 minute, all magic items within long range of the caster shed light as a torch. \n \n \n 38 \n All spellcasters within medium range immediately shed light as a torch, and special orbs revolve around them exposing the exact spheres they know, or magical schools they know spells of. \n \n \n 39 \n The caster drains a single spell point from any other creature that has spell points within close range. Creatures may attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect. Drained spell points are removed from the drained creature, and granted to the caster as temporary spell points that remain for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 40 \n A zone of antimagic is created, stretching out in a 10-foot radius from the square the caster is in. The zone nullifies the spell that triggered it, and remains for 1 day per caster level. \n \n \n 41 \n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \n \n \n 42 \n An explosion of mana invigorates everyone. You and all allies within medium range gain 3 temporary spell points that last for 1 hour. Spells cast with these temporary spell points gain a +4 to their caster level to the effect. \n \n \n 43 \n The caster becomes truly enlightened. They lose half of their maximum spell points, but increases their caster level by 4, and they gain knowledge of one additional talent in each base sphere they possess. This lasts for 1 hour. \n \n \n 44 \n The caster suffers 2 ability drain to their casting ability modifier, even if they would normally be immune to ability drain. \n \n \n 45 \n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 46 \n Magic abandons their host. All spellcasters within close range are no longer able to utilize their spellcasting, and for each spellcaster, a random other creature within range gains all of their spellcasting capabilities. This only includes spell points, base caster levels and magic skill bonuses and defense, and not class features. This effect remains for 2 rounds, where the spellcasting capabilities return to their host (not including any spent spell points). \n \n \n 47 \n The next sphere effect the caster utilizes, they may add a bonus to that sphere effect up to their caster level. The next two sphere effects they cast that costs a spell point has their caster level reduced by the amount the caster chose to increase their first cast by. \n \n \n 48 \n The effect becomes ultrapowered. Increase the caster level of the effect by 10, but increase the spell point cost by 5. If the caster does not have enough spell points to cast the effect, they are exhausted, but the spell effect is still cast. \n \n \n 49 \n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 50 \n You gain 60 feet scent, but can smell magic instead, allowing you to spend a standard action identifying a single creature or object to learn information about magical effects on that creature or object, as the base Divination ability. The use of magic doubles the range of your scent, and dead magic zones reduce it by half. This lasts for 24 hours. \n \n \n 51 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 52 \n Any manabonds the caster has active immediately become physical, as if casted with the Hardened Bond talent. This remains until the manabond otherwise expires normally. \n \n \n 53 \n For 1 hour, all attempts to utilize a sphere effect within medium range causes a swirling, rainbow colored orb to float around the caster. \n \n \n 54 \n Your magic blasts away foreign energies. In addition to its normal effects, you may make a free Counterspell attempt (as if you possessed the Counterspell feat) against any effects of your choice that your target has active upon them, and may exclude any effects you know of from this attempt. \n \n \n 55 \n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 56 \n You channel yourself too much into your magic; you become a creature of magic, gaining spell immunity to all spheres except the Mana sphere, but creatures can target you with antimagic effects. If you enter an antimagic field, are targeted by an antimagic effect (such as Counterspell), or otherwise enter a zone of dead magic, you must succeed at a Fortitude save each round or be slain. This lasts for 1 minute. \n \n \n 57 \n An errant manabond is created. You create a Funnel manabond between yourself and an enemy within close range, if any. That creature is considered the creator of this manabond, and may drain your spell points if they continue to concentrate on it. Use your caster level for the caster level of this manabond. \n \n \n 58 \n A magical sigil engraves on the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any beneficial magical effect cast on a target within this sigil is also cloned and cast upon every other creature standing on the sigil. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \n \n \n 59 \n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of their choice from any sphere they qualify for for 1 round. \n \n \n 60 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 61 \n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \n \n \n 62 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, they are instead dazed until the end of their next turn. \n \n \n 63 \n All creatures you have a manabond with are electrocuted by a sudden wave of mana. Deal 1d4 untyped damage for every odd level you have to yourself and any creature you have a manabond with. \n \n \n 64 \n A hostile sigil engraves into the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any expenditure of spell points within this area causes the creature spending spell points to suffer 1d8 nonlethal damage for each spell point spent. This damage increases by 1 die at 3rd caster level and every 3 levels thereafter. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \n \n \n 65 \n Any temporary spell points that any creature possesses within close range suddenly burst in a chaotic puff of energy, dealing 1d8 untyped damage per temporary spell point lost to the creatures that had them. \n \n \n 66 \n You lose your sense of targeting. For 1 round per caster level, every time you utilize a targeted sphere effect, you must randomly decide the target between any creatures within valid range. \n \n \n 67 \n (Combat) Caster is stunned for 1 round. \n \n \n 68 \n If the effect has a duration longer than instantaneous, it instead only remains for 1 round, but the caster level of the effect is increased by 10. If it is instantaneous, reroll this result. \n \n \n 69 \n All manabonds in close range are immediately subject to a dispel attempt with a result of 11 + the caster's caster level. \n \n \n 70 \n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \n \n \n 71 \n A catastrophic reaction occurs. All creatures within medium range must succeed at a Fortitude save or lose spell points equal to their Hit Dice. The caster loses all of their spell points on a failed save. \n \n \n 72 \n The effect's spell point cost is reduced to 0. \n \n \n 73 \n The ultimate catastrophic decay of internal magic occurs. For each base sphere the caster knows, they must roll a wild magic event on the respective sphere's table, in addition to rolling once on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 74 \n The caster's target is stunned for 1 round. Fortitude negates. \n \n \n 75 \n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \n \n \n 76 \n The caster's mana separates from the caster, forming a perfect transparent blue version of themselves that moves with them but is displaced 1 foot to the left. This remains for 24 hours. \n \n \n 77 \n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls are ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 78 \n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 79 \n Magical energies flow away from you easily. The next beneficial spell that is cast upon you is instead granted to a random enemy within close range. The caster is not aware of this effect, and the benefiting creature may choose to not activate this ability if the effect does not satisfy them, instead waiting for a different one to apply it to. This lasts for 1 hour. \n \n \n 80 \n You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level for 1 hour. You may not lower this spell resistance. \n \n \n 81 \n 1d6 random simple weapons suddenly materialize at the caster's feet, though such weapons are made of pure mana and are worthless. They remain permanently. \n \n \n 82 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 83 \n The effect fails, the action is lost, and spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 84 \n The caster is exhausted. If they were already exhausted, they fall asleep. \n \n \n 85 \n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \n \n \n 86 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 87 \n If the effect is instantaneous, the caster level is reduced to 1, but the effect applies again at the start of the target's turn for a number of rounds equal to the caster's casting ability modifier. If the effect is not instantaneous, reroll this result. \n \n \n 88 \n Wild energies infuse your magic. For 1 round per caster level, none of your effects may be negated by counterspells, antimagic fields or similar sources of antimagic. \n \n \n 89 \n For 1 hour, every time you spend a spell point, you suffer untyped damage equal to the caster level of the effect for each spell point spent. \n \n \n 90 \n The caster's hair is recolored to a vibrant blue color permanently. This can be dispelled normally. \n \n \n 91 \n Your magic infuses itself into your target. If you were casting a sphere effect on an ally or willing creature, you reduce their spell resistance by an amount equal to your casting ability modifier (or apply a penalty all saving throws they attempt against magic effects by the same amount). If you were casting on an enemy, you instead increase their spell resistance (or grant them a bonus on such effects). This lasts for 2 rounds. \n \n \n 92 \n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \n \n \n 93 \n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \n \n \n 94 \n Your magic evaporates, with it leaving a leaking hole of mana within you. The spell fails and all spell points are lost, and you lose 1 spell point at the start of each turn until you spend a full-round action restabilizing your magic by spending 1 spell point. \n \n \n 95 \n For 1 minute, each time the caster attempts to utilize a magic talent that is not in the Mana sphere, they are targeted by the base Spellburn talent. Use the caster's caster level and magic skill bonus to determine the effects of this talent. \n \n \n 96 \n All creatures within close range of the caster, including the caster, display obvious signs of how many spell points they have remaining, as detailed under the Unstable Storage general drawback. \n \n \n 97 \n The caster suffers from the Vulnerable Caster drawback for 1 day, gaining no benefits for it. \n \n \n 98 \n Magic becomes a beacon. All spellcasters that utilize a magic effect within medium range suffer a -1 penalty to their armor class for each magic effect they cast for the duration of this effect, and the penalty stacks with itself. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 99 \n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \n \n \n 100 \n The caster suffers 1d6 ability damage to their casting ability, even if they would normally be immune to ability damage."

This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 46 \n Magic abandons their host. All spellcasters within close range are no longer able to utilize their spellcasting, and for each spellcaster, a random other creature within range gains all of their spellcasting capabilities. This only includes spell points, base caster levels and magic skill bonuses and defense, and not class features. This effect remains for 2 rounds, where the spellcasting capabilities return to their host (not including any spent spell points). \n \n \n 47 \n The next sphere effect the caster utilizes, they may add a bonus to that sphere effect up to their caster level. The next two sphere effects they cast that costs a spell point has their caster level reduced by the amount the caster chose to increase their first cast by. \n \n \n 48 \n The effect becomes ultrapowered. Increase the caster level of the effect by 10, but increase the spell point cost by 5. If the caster does not have enough spell points to cast the effect, they are exhausted, but the spell effect is still cast. \n \n \n 49 \n You gain immunity to magic, becoming immune to all spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, but your caster level is reduced to 1. This lasts for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 50 \n You gain 60 feet scent, but can smell magic instead, allowing you to spend a standard action identifying a single creature or object to learn information about magical effects on that creature or object, as the base Divination ability. The use of magic doubles the range of your scent, and dead magic zones reduce it by half. This lasts for 24 hours. \n \n \n 51 \n The casting time increases by 1 step. \n \n \n 52 \n Any manabonds the caster has active immediately become physical, as if casted with the Hardened Bond talent. This remains until the manabond otherwise expires normally. \n \n \n 53 \n For 1 hour, all attempts to utilize a sphere effect within medium range causes a swirling, rainbow colored orb to float around the caster. \n \n \n 54 \n Your magic blasts away foreign energies. In addition to its normal effects, you may make a free Counterspell attempt (as if you possessed the Counterspell feat) against any effects of your choice that your target has active upon them, and may exclude any effects you know of from this attempt. \n \n \n 55 \n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 56 \n You channel yourself too much into your magic; you become a creature of magic, gaining spell immunity to all spheres except the Mana sphere, but creatures can target you with antimagic effects. If you enter an antimagic field, are targeted by an antimagic effect (such as Counterspell), or otherwise enter a zone of dead magic, you must succeed at a Fortitude save each round or be slain. This lasts for 1 minute. \n \n \n 57 \n An errant manabond is created. You create a Funnel manabond between yourself and an enemy within close range, if any. That creature is considered the creator of this manabond, and may drain your spell points if they continue to concentrate on it. Use your caster level for the caster level of this manabond. \n \n \n 58 \n A magical sigil engraves on the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any beneficial magical effect cast on a target within this sigil is also cloned and cast upon every other creature standing on the sigil. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \n \n \n 59 \n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of their choice from any sphere they qualify for for 1 round. \n \n \n 60 \n Effect receives a -4 penalty to caster level (minimum 1). \n \n \n 61 \n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \n \n \n 62 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, they are instead dazed until the end of their next turn. \n \n \n 63 \n All creatures you have a manabond with are electrocuted by a sudden wave of mana. Deal 1d4 untyped damage for every odd level you have to yourself and any creature you have a manabond with. \n \n \n 64 \n A hostile sigil engraves into the ground, filling an area with a 30-foot radius centered on the caster. Any expenditure of spell points within this area causes the creature spending spell points to suffer 1d8 nonlethal damage for each spell point spent. This damage increases by 1 die at 3rd caster level and every 3 levels thereafter. The sigil remains for 24 hours. \n \n \n 65 \n Any temporary spell points that any creature possesses within close range suddenly burst in a chaotic puff of energy, dealing 1d8 untyped damage per temporary spell point lost to the creatures that had them. \n \n \n 66 \n You lose your sense of targeting. For 1 round per caster level, every time you utilize a targeted sphere effect, you must randomly decide the target between any creatures within valid range. \n \n \n 67 \n (Combat) Caster is stunned for 1 round. \n \n \n 68 \n If the effect has a duration longer than instantaneous, it instead only remains for 1 round, but the caster level of the effect is increased by 10. If it is instantaneous, reroll this result. \n \n \n 69 \n All manabonds in close range are immediately subject to a dispel attempt with a result of 11 + the caster's caster level. \n \n \n 70 \n The caster learns an eldritch secret about mana. They gain knowledge of a Mana sphere talent they qualify for for 24 hours. \n \n \n 71 \n A catastrophic reaction occurs. All creatures within medium range must succeed at a Fortitude save or lose spell points equal to their Hit Dice. The caster loses all of their spell points on a failed save. \n \n \n 72 \n The effect's spell point cost is reduced to 0. \n \n \n 73 \n The ultimate catastrophic decay of internal magic occurs. For each base sphere the caster knows, they must roll a wild magic event on the respective sphere's table, in addition to rolling once on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 74 \n The caster's target is stunned for 1 round. Fortitude negates. \n \n \n 75 \n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \n \n \n 76 \n The caster's mana separates from the caster, forming a perfect transparent blue version of themselves that moves with them but is displaced 1 foot to the left. This remains for 24 hours. \n \n \n 77 \n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls are ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 78 \n The effect fails, but the action is not lost. Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 79 \n Magical energies flow away from you easily. The next beneficial spell that is cast upon you is instead granted to a random enemy within close range. The caster is not aware of this effect, and the benefiting creature may choose to not activate this ability if the effect does not satisfy them, instead waiting for a different one to apply it to. This lasts for 1 hour. \n \n \n 80 \n You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level for 1 hour. You may not lower this spell resistance. \n \n \n 81 \n 1d6 random simple weapons suddenly materialize at the caster's feet, though such weapons are made of pure mana and are worthless. They remain permanently. \n \n \n 82 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 83 \n The effect fails, the action is lost, and spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 84 \n The caster is exhausted. If they were already exhausted, they fall asleep. \n \n \n 85 \n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \n \n \n 86 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 87 \n If the effect is instantaneous, the caster level is reduced to 1, but the effect applies again at the start of the target's turn for a number of rounds equal to the caster's casting ability modifier. If the effect is not instantaneous, reroll this result. \n \n \n 88 \n Wild energies infuse your magic. For 1 round per caster level, none of your effects may be negated by counterspells, antimagic fields or similar sources of antimagic. \n \n \n 89 \n For 1 hour, every time you spend a spell point, you suffer untyped damage equal to the caster level of the effect for each spell point spent. \n \n \n 90 \n The caster's hair is recolored to a vibrant blue color permanently. This can be dispelled normally. \n \n \n 91 \n Your magic infuses itself into your target. If you were casting a sphere effect on an ally or willing creature, you reduce their spell resistance by an amount equal to your casting ability modifier (or apply a penalty all saving throws they attempt against magic effects by the same amount). If you were casting on an enemy, you instead increase their spell resistance (or grant them a bonus on such effects). This lasts for 2 rounds. \n \n \n 92 \n The caster gains a +2 inherent bonus to their casting ability modifier for 1 minute. \n \n \n 93 \n The caster emits light as a torch for 1 hour. \n \n \n 94 \n Your magic evaporates, with it leaving a leaking hole of mana within you. The spell fails and all spell points are lost, and you lose 1 spell point at the start of each turn until you spend a full-round action restabilizing your magic by spending 1 spell point. \n \n \n 95 \n For 1 minute, each time the caster attempts to utilize a magic talent that is not in the Mana sphere, they are targeted by the base Spellburn talent. Use the caster's caster level and magic skill bonus to determine the effects of this talent. \n \n \n 96 \n All creatures within close range of the caster, including the caster, display obvious signs of how many spell points they have remaining, as detailed under the Unstable Storage general drawback. \n \n \n 97 \n The caster suffers from the Vulnerable Caster drawback for 1 day, gaining no benefits for it. \n \n \n 98 \n Magic becomes a beacon. All spellcasters that utilize a magic effect within medium range suffer a -1 penalty to their armor class for each magic effect they cast for the duration of this effect, and the penalty stacks with itself. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 99 \n For 1 hour, all penalties to the caster's caster level are instead treated as untyped bonuses. \n \n \n 100 \n The caster suffers 1d6 ability damage to their casting ability, even if they would normally be immune to ability damage."

The suggested course of activity must be limited to a sentence or two and must be a very simple request. The creature performs the suggested action until it finishes, or for 1 hour per caster level, whichever comes first. If you choose, you can instead specify conditions the creature should look for, (i.e., \"you should search the next person who enters this room, looking for weapons.\") If the condition is not met before this duration expires, the activity is not performed. Greater Charm:  This works as the lesser charm, but may be up to a basic request. Very simple requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty. The target cannot be asked to do anything it would not normally do. Powerful Charm:  This works as the lesser charm, but the creature obeys any course of action given, so long as the suggestion is not obviously fatal or against the target's nature. Basic requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty, while very simple requests cause the save to be made with a -4 penalty. Mind Talent Types Some mind talents are designated (charm) talents.

      "benefits": "Talents marked with the (cloud) tag allow the caster to spend a standard action to create clouds of mental energy that emanate from an area, object, or creature within close range. When applying a cloud to an unwilling creature or an attended object they are allowed a Will save to resist, and both placing a cloud and the effects of a cloud are subject to spell resistance. A creature is immune to cloud effects placed upon itself or its worn and carried equipment. An imbued area may either be 10 feet in radius + an extra 5 feet per caster level, or a 10-foot wide area that extends for a length of 10 feet + 10 feet per caster level (such as would be appropriate to fill a 10-foot wide hallway). An imbued item may be no larger than 5 cubic feet per caster level in size. A creature may be up to the caster's size + 1 size category for every 5 caster levels. It is possible to imbue a portion of an item or creature (a single head of a massive, two-headed dragon or a single segment of a lengthy carpet with blood smeared over it, for instance) but hiding a portion of an item or creature will not prevent the whole of it from being noticed. Unless otherwise specified, a cloud's radius extends from an item or creature as if the creature was the center of an imbued area measured as a radius. As with charms, most clouds have three strengths; lesser, greater, and powerful. Spell point expenditures remain the same for the three strengths, and you may only affect a creature with a cloud if you could also affect it with a charm. Similarly, the Powerful Charm talent is required to use the powerful versions of clouds and you may only imbue the same item, creature, or area with a lesser cloud once per day. With the exception of Mass Charm, (cloud) talents are affected by talents that affect charms."

Lesser charms created in this way are not limited to only being usable once per target. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion.

    "amnesia (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You may reach into a subject's memory and remove information and awareness of people, places, things, or events. Lesser Charm:  The target loses any recollection of what happened in the last round, back to the beginning of your previous round's actions (Will negates). A reminder of the events, such as witnessing a similar action taken by one of the involved creatures or distinctive items being used in the same fashion or someone spending a free action to inform the person about the event, allows the target to make a new Will save to recall the forgotten moment, or the target may have their memory restored through the Life sphere's Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, any effect that removes the confused condition, or the use of the Inception talent's lesser, greater, or powerful charms being used to specifically make the target remember what was forgotten. Greater Charm:  The target loses all awareness of the immediate past (Will negates). This affects all memories from up to 1 minute per caster level. Alternatively, a target may lose all memory of just a single person, location, item, or event, such as the identity of a friend or a robbery they participated in. If the memory of an event is forgotten, the event's duration in real life can only have 1 minute per caster level removed from the target's memory. A target's memory may be restored through the Life sphere's Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, or through the Inception talent's greater or powerful charms being used to specifically make the target remember what was forgotten. Powerful Charm:  The target loses all memory of events that transpired in the recent past (Will negates). This may erase memories going back 1 day per caster level. The caster may erase all or part of the subject's memory of this time. A target's memory may only be restored through the Life sphere's Break Enchantment effect if the caster also possesses the Restore Mind talent, or through the wish or miracle spells.

Lesser Charm:  The target loses the benefit of any spell or effect with the emotion descriptor, as well as any morale bonus from magical or extraordinary effects (Will negates). This includes a paladin's auras, the good hope spell, the effects of an eliciter's emotions, bardic music, or a barbarian's rage. The effects are suppressed, but not dispelled. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your caster level. Any aggressive action toward or damage dealt to a creature under the effect of this ability automatically ends the effect. Greater Charm:  In addition to the effects of the lesser charm, this charm removes any desire to fight or engage in revelrous behavior. No violent actions or destructive actions may be taken by the creature, but the target may still defend itself normally. In addition, effects related to emotion that grant effects beyond simple bonuses (such as a bard's fascinate ability or certain eliciter emotions) cannot be initiated (Will negates). Powerful Charm:  In addition to the effects of the greater charm, the target of this ability simply loses any desire to act. The target is overwhelmed with soothing peace and calm and as such may take no actions, but the target may still defend itself normally (Will negates)."

This does not compel them to speak, but it does prevent any words they do say from being intentionally dishonest (Will negates). A target may not realize they are magically compelled to speak the truth if the caster has the Subtlety talent, but even if unaware they may receive a Reflex save to stop themselves from talking when they attempt to tell a lie and realize that their words are changing. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. Greater Charm:  This functions as the lesser charm, but the duration of the Candor is increased to a number of hours equal to your caster level (Will negates). Powerful Charm:  The target is compelled to answer a single question directly put to it. A successful save allows the target to ignore any similar questions asked with this talent for a number of minutes equal to its Wisdom score. (Ultimately the definition of \"similar\" is up to the GM, but generally the question \"Who stole the queen's jewels?\" is considered similar to \"Did you steal the queen's jewels?\" but is not considered similar to \"What were you doing on the night the jewels were stolen?\" because the focus shifts from identifying a culprit to stating an activity.)"

In addition to dealing 1d8 points of nonlethal damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d8), you also deal 1d4 points of ability damage to the target's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) + an additional 1 point of ability damage per 6 caster levels. Against a successful Will save, you instead deal half of the nonlethal damage you would have dealt and no ability damage. (For example, a 10th level caster would deal 5d8 points of nonlethal damage + 1d4+1 points of ability score damage to either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, but against a successful save would only deal half of 5d8 nonlethal damage.) Ability damage dealt this way cannot decrease an ability score below 1. Powerful Charm:  The force of your mental assault causes a physiological backlash in the target, along with self-inflicted wounds. You deal 1d8 points of nonlethal damage per 2 caster levels (no save) and 1d8 + 1 per 6 caster levels of ability damage to your choice of the target's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (Will halves)."

This could include yelling loudly, falling to the ground, dropping its weapon, or moving in a generalized direction (away, toward, left, right, etc.). For the purpose of this talent, standing still is a free action. The target cannot use its other actions on that turn to undo the effect of this lesser charm (pick up a dropped weapon, move back to its old square, stand up if it fell down, etc.). Greater Charm:  You take control of the target for as long as you concentrate, to a maximum of 1 round per caster level. (Will negates). The target is allowed a new saving throw as a free action each round at the end of its turn to throw off this control. Other than verbal actions, the target cannot perform an action of its own choice on its turn. While under your control, the target mentally fights you, and so can only be made to perform a single move action or standard action each round. The creature can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. While you may command a target to use an item or perform magic, this does not grant you knowledge of the target's magical abilities or inventory. While you can command a creature to stand still and take no action, you cannot command a creature to become helpless or give up its Dexterity bonus to AC.

You must concentrate to maintain this effect, up to a maximum number of rounds equal to half your caster level (minimum 1) or until the target fails a concentration check, whichever comes first. Greater Charm:  As the lesser charm, though you no longer need to concentrate to maintain the effect, the duration is equal to your caster level (or until the target fails a concentration check, whichever comes first), and the concentration DC equals 10 + your casting ability modifier + your caster level. Powerful Charm:  As the greater charm, though the effect persists even if the target fails a concentration check, lasting for up to a maximum duration of a number of rounds equal to your caster level."

Lesser Charm:  You increase the target's disposition toward you by 1 step to a maximum of friendly for 1 minute per caster level (Will negates). Greater Charm:  You increase the target's disposition toward you to friendly for 1 minute per caster level (Will negates). You may make requests of the target, but asking it to do anything it would not normally do requires an opposed Charisma check, and it never obeys requests that are obviously fatal or against its nature, although the target may be convinced dangerous things are worth doing.

    "esteem (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You imbue a target with an increased sense of self-worth, capacity for persuasion, and force of personality (Will negates). Lesser Charm:  You grant a competence bonus to a single Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based skill check of the target's choice equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) that is performed within 1 hour + 1 hour per 5 caster levels. The target counts as enchanted while under the effects of this charm, and a DC 25 Sense Motive check will determine that the target is not wholly acting as themselves. Greater Charm:  This acts the same as the lesser charm, but the bonus to the check now equals your caster level. As a drawback to this charm, this DC of the Sense Motive check to detect the charm on the target is reduced to 15. This level of the charm may only be used once per day on a target.

Greater Charm:  The target gains the shocked condition for 1 minute per caster level (Will negates). On a successful saving throw, they gain the uncertain condition for 1 minute. Powerful Charm:  This functions as the greater charm, except the target gains the dumbfounded condition for 10 minutes per caster level on a failed saving throw."
    },
    "gestures (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You mentally pull and tug at the target's muscles and the aspects of its mind that relate to motor functions. Lesser Charm:  You influence the physical gestures made by a target and the actions of the target's limbs and extremities (Will negates). You may impose a failure chance on any other magic user whose magic requires a somatic component equal to 10% + an additional 5% for every 5 caster levels (this effect stacks with similar failure chances, such as the arcane spell failure chance that accompanies armor). In addition, you may impose a circumstance penalty to any of the target's skill checks that would ordinarily be subject to an armor check penalty equal to 2 + 1 per every 5 caster levels. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level, or until you cease concentrating on the effect. Greater Charm:  In addition to the effects of the lesser charm, you may enforce quick, shambling actions on the target or interruptions of actions the target is taking. You may force the target to pick up or drop an object in a space within its reach, although the target may only be forced to drop things that are held (as opposed to worn or bound in some way). As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you may make a flat-footed target fall prone, or otherwise make a ranged trip attempt against a target that uses your caster level in place of your BAB and your casting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier. If the target is flat-footed you may cause a check that would be affected by an armor check penalty to automatically fail. Finally, you may also prevent the usage of any magical ability that requires gestures or somatic components. Powerful Charm:  In addition to the effects of the lesser and greater charms, you gain nearly full control over the quick gestures and movements of the target. If your target threatens a square where another creature provokes an attack of opportunity, you may force the target to take an attack of opportunity against that target if they have any attacks of opportunity remaining (this counts as one of your attacks of opportunity). You may force the target to move up to half of its move speed in any direction that you wish. You may also use the target to provide the somatic components for your own magical effects, and even make the target the origin point of those effects so long as only somatic components are required. (Casters with the Utterances talent may include verbal components with no extra save required). You may also allow this magic to work in either direction, allowing a willing target to control you or vice versa (for example, a friendly rogue might pick a lock that only you can reach using your hands, or you might use your own painting skills to paint a picture through a friendly paladin's hands to impress a dignitary)."
    },
    "hostility (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You cause the target to enter a blinding rage. Lesser Charm:  You compel the target to attack the nearest creature on it next turn (Will negates). The target moves until this creature is within range and makes at least one attack with a weapon, natural attack, or unarmed strike. If no such creature can be reached, the target instead deals damage to itself equal to 1d8 + its Strength modifier with whatever it has in hand. Greater Charm:  The target enters a rage for 1 round per caster level (Will negates if unwilling). The target gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 bonus to Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. In addition, the target cannot use any spells, nor any skills or class features based off of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. This counts as a barbarian's rage, except the target is not fatigued at the end. Powerful Charm:  Same as the greater charm, but you may grant one of the following packages to the target as well: Heroic Rage:  The target's bonus to Strength and Constitution increases to +4, and their bonus to Will saves increases to +2. The target may still use spells, as well as class features and skills based off of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. \n Brutal Rage:  The target is compelled to hostility and each round attacks the nearest target to itself, be it friend or foe. If the creature cannot attack something during its turn, it deals 1d8 + its Strength modifier damage to itself with whatever it has in hand."
    },
    "incense (charm) [lots]": {
      "benefits": "You stoke the target's anger into a raging inferno. Lesser Charm:  The target gains either the angry or livid condition towards a target of your choice for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). Greater Charm:  This functions as the lesser charm, except that you may make the target enraged for the duration rather than angry or livid. On a successful saving throw, the target still becomes angry for 1 round. Powerful Charm:  This functions as the greater charm, except that you may make the target frenzied for the duration. In addition, you may change the target of the target's frenzy as a standard action."
    },
    "inception (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You add trivia, knowledge, and memories to a person's mind, whether or not this information is grounded in fact. Lesser Charm:  You may \"create a rumor\" in a target's mind, suggesting information that a target \"heard somewhere\" or \"read once\" but that they haven't actually encountered (Will negates). As part of the casting, you may make a magic skill check or Bluff check opposed by the target's Sense Motive check (using modifiers as listed for the Bluff skill) to see how firmly the target adheres to this new information; as with a Bluff check, they may not believe this rumor even if they believe that they heard it or read it somewhere. Evidence that conflicts with the implanted memory allows a new Will save to realize that the information is faulty, though failure on a new Will save doesn't mean that the target is compelled to believe the old information (instead believing that they had learned some faulty information). In addition, the Life sphere's Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, any effect that removes the confused condition, or the Amnesia talent's lesser, greater, or powerful charms may be used to either remove false implanted information, or to make the target realize that the information is faulty. Greater Charm:  As the lesser version of the talent, but the target's new memory can relate to things within their own experience or of their own devisement (such as details about friends' lives or current news discussed at a tavern the night before). The new memories will take precedence over the old if they contradict, but the old memories will still remain (for example, a guard may have the memory of a different combination for a combination lock, password for a door, or route through a maze, but nothing stops them from recalling the true information when the implanted memories prove false.) Encountering evidence that contradicts the new memory allows a new Will save to realize that the new memories are false. In addition, the Life sphere's Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, or the Amnesia talent's greater or powerful charms may be used to either remove false implanted information, or to make the target realize that the information is faulty. Powerful Charm:  As the greater version of the talent, though you may now craft entirely new memories of events that the target has personally witnessed (Will negates). These memories are indistinguishable from actual memories, and appear to fit the flow of the continuity of their memories, but do not otherwise remove or alter the previous memories. A contradictory memory offers a +4 bonus to both the Will save to resist the charm and the Sense Motive check to resist believing the new memory. Similarly, memories of creatures doing something that they would not normally do or doing things against their nature give a further +2 or +4 bonus to these checks, respectively. A target's false memories may only be removed or proven false through the Life sphere's Break Enchantment effect if the caster also possesses the Restore Mind talent, or through the wish or miracle spells. The target's memory may also be replenished through the Amnesia talent's powerful charm being used to specifically make the target realize what memories are faulty."
    },
    "inspiration (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You inspire competence in the target. Lesser Charm:  As an immediate action, you may add a +2 competence bonus to a skill check or attack roll the target has just made. This can change a failure into a success. You must choose to use this charm after the roll has been made, but before the results are revealed. Greater Charm:  This is the same as the lesser charm, except it adds +2d4 to the attack roll or skill check instead of +2. Powerful Charm:  This is the same as the greater charm, except it adds +2d4 + 1 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) to the roll instead of only +2d4."
    },
    "mind shield (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You may establish a ward on the mind of another, one capable of providing protection from mental assault. Lesser Charm:  You create a metaphysical bubble of protective insight over the mind of a willing creature. This keen intellectual insight bestows a morale bonus to Will saves equal to 1 + 1/2 your caster level for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This mind shield is nullified as soon as the target makes a single Will save, whether or not the save was successful. This does not suppress or remove existing magical effects on creatures, it merely protects them from further mental attacks. This charm may be used multiple times per day on targets. Greater Charm:  You establish a notional cloud of ablative thought over the mind of a willing creature. This blur of ideological presence bestows a morale bonus to Will saves equal to your caster level for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This mind shield is halved in effectiveness with each Will save made, whether or not the save was successful (for example, if bestowed by a 7th level caster it would provide a +7 morale bonus to Will saves, followed by a +3 morale bonus to Will saves after the target makes a Will save, followed by a +1 morale bonus to Will saves before being depleted entirely). This does not suppress or remove existing magical effects on creatures, it merely protects them from further mental attacks. Powerful Charm:  You impart an adamant shield of conceptual certainty upon the mind of a willing creature. This creature gains immunity to any enchantment spell or effect that would require a Will save for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This immunity can be overcome with a magic skill check against your MSD. Even if this immunity is bypassed, the target receives a bonus to Will saves equal to your caster level."
    },
    "mind spy (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You can send a piece of your mind into your target to see the world through their eyes (save negates). The target gets a new Will save every time you use this ability, although consecutive rounds do not give additional saves. While this link to your target remains, you can choose to use this ability at any time before the link expires, or have its activation linked to a specific event that your target may experience. Lesser Charm:  While the link remains active, you can use the target's senses for 1 round per caster level and see and hear what they can. The rounds need not be consecutive. The link remains active for up to 1 hour per caster level from the time the target is first affected. Abilities that block or suppress possession or remove enchantments (such as the protection from evil spell or the Break Enchantment talent) will similarly block, suppress, or remove the effect of this charm on your target. Greater Charm:  As the lesser charm, but you can use their senses for 1 minute per caster level, and the link lasts for 1 day per caster level. Powerful Charm:  As the greater charm, but you can use their senses for 1 hour per caster level, and the link lasts for 1 week per caster level."
    },
    "paralyze (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You freeze the target in place. Lesser Charm:  The target is dazed for 1 round (Will negates). Greater Charm:  The target is stunned for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). The target is allowed a new Will save each round to end this effect early. This is a full-round action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Powerful Charm:  This is the same as the Paralyze greater charm, except the target is paralyzed instead of stunned."
    },
    "project thoughts (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You can communicate directly into the mind of another. Lesser Charm:  You may project a telepathic message to a target consisting of no more than 25 words. If you and the target do not possess a shared language, this form of communication is impossible. Unlike other lesser charms, there is no limit to the number of times you may use this on a target in a day. Greater Charm:  Your projected telepathic message does not have a word limit, although communication is carried out in real time and you must concentrate for as long as you communicate. You can communicate with the target even without a shared language. Powerful Charm:  This functions the same as the greater charm, except the target may also respond to you with their own projected telepathic messages, allowing for two-way communication. However, the target is under no obligation to respond in any way and can simply remain silent if they so choose."
    },
    "read mind (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You can pull information from a target's mind. Lesser Charm:  You may detect a creature's emotional state (Will negates if unwilling). Unlike other lesser charms, there is no limit to the number of times you may use this lesser charm on a target in a day. Greater Charm:  You may read the surface thoughts of a creature (Will negates if unwilling) for as long as you concentrate. Powerful Charm:  You may pull a specific piece of information out of a creature's mind (Will negates). This is usually enough information to answer a single, specific question to the best of that creature's knowledge, in no more than 25 words. A creature who successfully saves against this powerful charm may choose to provide no answer to your question or attempt to lie with their Bluff skill. If you use this powerful charm twice on the same creature to ask the same question, the same answer (correct, no answer or lie) is given again."
    },
    "recommend (charm) [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You point out obvious things the target did wrong, hoping they'll do better next time. Lesser Charm:  For 1 round per caster level, whenever the target fails an attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or ability check, at the start of the target's next turn, the target gains a +1 morale bonus on their first roll with that type of check for 1 round. Greater Charm:  This functions as the lesser charm, except the duration increases to 1 minute per caster level and the bonus increases to +1 + 1 per 4 caster levels. Powerful Charm:  This functions as the greater charm, except the duration increases to 1 hour per caster level. What is \"Failure\":  For the purposes of this talent, a failure occurs when an action or roll that carried real risk does not succeed; most checks made in combat can fail, but a target of this sphere effect cannot perform simple skill checks in hopes of failing before attempting a more important check. The GM is the final arbiter of which checks are capable of failure. Some examples include an attack roll missing a target or provoking an attack of opportunity when using the Acrobatics skill to move through an enemy's threatened area, etc."
    },
    "sleep (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You put the target to sleep. Lesser Charm:  You make the target lethargic, making it staggered for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). Greater Charm:  You put the target to sleep for 1 minute per caster level (Will negates). Targets who take damage automatically wake up, and other creatures may wake a sleeping creature as a standard action (an application of the aid another action). Powerful Charm:  The target is placed into a deeper slumber. Whenever the sleeping target takes damage or another creature attempts to wake it as a standard action, the target does not automatically awaken, but instead attempts a new Will save to wake up with a +4 bonus."
    },
    "utterances (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You tamper with a mind's language center, and the muscles controlling speech to impede or alter the flow of words. Lesser Charm:  You can tug on the strings of conversation, altering the sounds of words, inserting or negating vocalizations as you see fit. You may impose a failure chance on any other magic user whose magic requires a verbal component equal to 10% + an additional 5% for every 5 caster levels (this effect stacks with similar failure chances, such as the 20% chance that accompanies the deafened condition). In addition, you may impose a circumstance bonus or penalty to the target's Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform checks equal to 2 + 1 per every 5 caster levels. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level. Greater Charm:  In addition to the effects of the lesser charm, you may wrest full control from a target's speech by stopping them from speaking entirely or choosing words for them to say. This can prevent a target from using magic that requires verbal components or other vocalizations, and can force a target that remains within range to only say what you want them to say. A target not specifically under the mental command to remain silent will be able to say whatever it wishes if it leaves the range of the effect. If you attempt to make a target say something that would be against the target's nature (such as a young lover renouncing affection for his or her betrothed, or a dragon agreeing to a verbal contract to part with some of its treasure), it gains another Will save to resist the effect. Powerful Charm:  Your control over the speech of the target is fluid and nearly flawless. In addition to the effects of the lesser and greater charms you may make the target speak so eloquently that you may roll a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform check through them using your own ranks instead of its own, provided that the check in question is vocal in nature. You may also make use of the target's skills in these ranks yourself, borrowing the talent or, if you wish, allowing the target to directly speak through you. You may also use magic that requires verbal components (but no other components) through the target, as if the magic originated from the target's space. Casters with the Gestures talent may include somatic components with no extra save required."
    },
    "vision (charm)": {
      "benefits": "You may make someone see things that are not there. Lesser Charm:  You may alter a creature's perception of a single creature, object, sound, or effect for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). You may alter 1 sense (sight, sound, touch/pain, taste, smell); for example, you could make a thief appear to be an alley cat, make a scratch appear as a gaping knife wound, or make the sound of footsteps seem like the wind. You cannot use this to replicate speech or sights and sounds you have never encountered before, nor to make something invisible. If used to cover up pain (such as hiding the target taking damage) the target gains a +4 bonus to their Will save. If the target interacts with the object of their altered perception, they are allowed an additional save every round they continue to do so. Greater Charm:  This functions as the lesser charm, except you may affect all 5 senses in relation to the chosen creature, object, sound, or effect. Powerful Charm:  This functions as the greater charm, except you may change the target's perception of everything around them. This grants the target a new saving throw each round they interact with any part of the altered surroundings."

    "wrack (charm) [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "You flood your target with disturbing sensations Lesser Charm:  You cause the target to become sickened for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). Greater Charm:  You cause a target to become nauseated for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). On a successful save, they are still sickened for 1 round per caster level. Powerful Charm:  This is the same as the greater charm, except the target becomes stunned for 1 round in addition to being nauseated. On a successful save, they are still sickened for 1 round per caster level. Cloud Talents"
    },
    "dispersion (cloud)": {
      "benefits": "You imbue a creature or object with a field of refracting cogitative energy that makes it difficult to focus on what or where the field masks. Lesser Cloud:  The creature or object becomes difficult to locate intentionally and almost impossible to stumble across accidentally. Disguise checks to recognize a creature and Perception checks required to locate such an object or person have their DCs increased by 1 + 1 for every 2 caster levels, and any creature with this ability placed upon them may immediately attempt to hide even if observed or without cover or concealment. Loud noises, sudden actions, or other typically noticeable events allow creatures near such an effect to make a Perception check (still modified by the lesser charm's boost to DCs) to notice the creature. This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. If the creature makes an attack against another creature, the effect automatically ends. Greater Cloud:  In addition to the lesser effects of Dispersion, a magic skill check may be rolled at the time of casting, prompting a Will save from anyone in the cloud's line of sight. If the check result is higher than any given observer's Will save, then when the target is successfully hidden from direct observation the observer will forget about their active presence in the environment. If the observer is reminded about the target by being told of its presence or directly observing it, the observer gains another Will save to recall the target and the target's significance to the current situation. (Successfully hiding again may, however, cause the observer to forget the target again.) Powerful Cloud:  In addition to the lesser and greater effects of Dispersion, the warded area, object, or creature becomes supernaturally difficult to observe. Even if a creature is aware of the target, they must pass a Will save every round to actively engage with the target, such as through conversation, attacking, searching, or medical treatment. Skill checks that are carried out over the course of minutes, hours, or days (or similar unit of time) instead of rounds impose a Will save for every unit of time involved instead of every round due to the increased intentional focus of the people performing such tasks (up to the duration of the Dispersion effect)."
    },
    "lure (cloud)": {
      "benefits": "You may cause a location or object to radiate a cloud that invites or repels either creatures of a given type (such as monstrous humanoids or outsiders with the fire subtype), a specific kind of creature (such as blue dragons or red-furred hobgoblins), or creatures of a specific alignment (such as lawful neutral creatures). If the effect is used to invite creatures, they feel elated and pleased to be in the area of the effect, or desire to touch or possess the affected item. They have an overpowering desire to stay in the area or remain in contact with the item. If the effect is used to repel creatures, they feel an urge to leave the area or avoid the object in question. The creatures will actively shun the area and not willingly return to it while the talent's effect is active. If a save to resist the invitation effect is successful, the creature is unaffected, but they must reattempt the save after 1d6 x 10 minutes if they are still within range and the effect is still continuing. Similarly, if the save to resist the repulsion effect is successful, the creature may remain in the area or in contact with the object, but will feel uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points (to a minimum of 1) until they leave the area of the effect. Lesser Cloud:  The lure effect can invite or repel creatures of up to 1/2 your caster level in HD (Will negates). The effect applies to any creature who comes within close range of the effect. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level. Greater Cloud:  As the lesser cloud, except it can affect creatures of up to your caster level in HD, applies to any creature who comes within medium range of the effect, and lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. Powerful Cloud:  As the lesser cloud, except the Lure effects creatures of up to twice your caster level in HD, applies to any creature who comes within longrange of the effect, and lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. Casters with the Ranged Mind talent may extend the range to extreme range (1,000 ft. + 100 ft. per level, see The Destroyer's Handbook). Casters with both the Ranged Mind talent and the Zeitgeist advanced talent may make the lure's effect cover either 1 mile/caster level, or communities of up to 10,000 or smaller."
    },
    "misdirect (cloud)": {
      "benefits": "You imbue an area to persuade travelers to wander elsewhere. Lesser Cloud:  A creature entering the cloud must succeed on a Will save. Failure causes them to, potentially, change directions. Roll a d8 as if throwing a splash weapon that missed its target square; on a 1, the creature continues moving in its intended direction. On a 2 through 8, count around the target creature's adjacent squares in a clockwise direction to determine the direction it walks in. It finishes moving after the intended distance has been traversed, or after it moves into an obstruction (such as a wall.) If it was moving faster than its typical movement speed (such as by running) the creature takes 1d4 nonlethal damage. This cloud lasts for one minute per caster level. Greater Cloud:  As the lesser cloud, but you determine the new direction of travel when imbuing the area with the cloud and may select a number of familiar creatures equal to your casting ability modifier to be immune to the cloud's effects. Powerful Cloud:  As the greater cloud, but you may alter the direction of every target moving through the cloud as a free action as long as you remain within close range of the cloud.

    "suppress (cloud) [eo3]": {
      "benefits": "You imbue an area, creature or object with a field of disruptive cognitive energy, making it difficult to communicate or convey expression and meaning. This cloud lasts for one minute per caster level. Additionally, whenever a creature benefiting from a sphere effect granting them additional languages or insights into language would enter the cloud, you may attempt a magic skill check against the effect's magic skill defense. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled; if you fail, the effect is not affected and cannot be dispelled by the same cloud for 24 hours. If you possess the Mass Charm talent, you may choose to have the cloud ignore any amount of creatures you designate, which can be changed as a free action. Lesser Cloud:  Creatures within the cloud suffer a -2 penalty to all Charisma-based skills checks, in addition to a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against language-dependant effects. These bonuses and penalties increase by 1 per 3 caster levels. Greater Cloud:  As the lesser cloud, except that they lose all languages that they possess that require verbal speech (this excludes telepathy or non-verbal languages) for as long as they remain within the cloud. These creatures can still shout and act out simple concepts, but the capabilities of speech are lost to them. Powerful Cloud:  As the greater cloud, except that they lose all ability to communicate in all forms, including non-verbal languages and telepathy, for as long as they remain within the cloud. This also means that these creatures cannot act out simple concepts or emote in any way, except for volume. Cognition Talents"

    "arcane calculation (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "When you use Perception to intentionally search for stimuli (typically a move action), you may measure a single aspect of whatever you perceive. You may calculate this aspect with perfect accuracy depending on how your Perception check compares to the DC to perceive it, requiring higher results to estimate from vague or incomplete information (see the table below). Alternately, you may focus on a target you wish to attack as a standard action. This allows you to roll twice on the first attack roll you make against them within the next minute and take the better result. If you focus again before making such an attack, you lose the benefits of any previous focus attempts.

    "intuit knowledge (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point as a full-round action to gain temporary understanding of a subject. This allows you to use half your caster level in place of your ranks in one Knowledge or Profession skill, chosen when you use this ability. This effect grants you the ability to use the skill as if you were trained, and lasts for 1 hour per caster level. Multiple applications of this effect do not stack, the latest effect replaces the previous one."
    },
    "mental archive (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "You construct a magical mental system to perfectly memorize information. By concentrating as long it requires to perceive something (such as the duration of a speech or while reading a book), you can archive it. Once a memory is archived you can concentrate to remember it. This can allow you to notice new details by attempting Perception checks. This does not allow you to use senses or similar abilities that you did not use or possess at the time of memorization (such as a Divination sphere effect, or blindsight). You can archive a number of memories equal to your casting ability modifier + 1 per 2 caster levels. A single memory can be up to one book (roughly 400 pages or 100,000 words), one hour of sound, or one minute of full sensory experience. Larger works can be archived by using multiple memories. You may memorize the content of magical texts and similar information, but cannot use their magical properties from memory (such as casting from scrolls, scribing spells, or preparing spells from a spellbook). You may unarchive memories as a free action, losing your ability to perfectly recall them. You may permanently archive a memory by spending a spell point; over the next 24 hours, you engrave it perfectly into your memory. You cannot replenish the spent spell point until the 24 hours are complete. At the end of this time, the memory no longer counts against your archived memories. Tracking Memories:  Mental Archive allows characters to store and replace memories, which can require keeping track of. It is recommended that players keep a clear list of what they have temporarily and permanently memorized."

    "parallel cognition (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you can divide your mental attention to gain two sets of actions each turn, one physical and one mental. Your physical actions are limited to a simple, repetitive task (such as following a road, loading a cart, or digging a hole) or a task that exactly follows detailed instructions (such as playing from sheet music or cooking from a recipe). You cannot effectively engage in combat: you lose your Dexterity bonus to armor class and automatically miss against targets with an AC greater than 10. Your mental actions can be any purely mental actions, such as using magic without verbal or somatic components, attempting Perception, Knowledge, Sense Motive, or similar skill checks. As a standard mental action you can change what task your physical body is assigned to or end this effect."

    "polyglot (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may gain a rough understanding of a target's language. You can grasp basic concepts (such as 'danger,' 'help,' or 'wait') but not complex details. This also allows you to communicate in the same language as long as you continue concentrating, though with the same limitation to basic concepts. The effects of this last for as long as you concentrate. By spending a spell point, you may understand and communicate in a target's language without any limitations and maintain the effect without concentration for 1 hour per caster level. The effects of this talent apply to all mediums of communication (such as spoken, signed, or written) but you only understand the mediums you observe (so you cannot write a language you have only heard, or speak a language you have only read)."
    },
    "rapid processing (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "You can analyze information with a glance. As a swift or move action you can read up to 500 words or analyze a complex work of art, value an item with Appraise, get a hunch or sense enchantment with Sense Motive, search for tracks with Survival, or intentionally search with Perception. By spending a spell point as a swift action you can make passive analysis effortless for 1 hour per caster level. You no longer need to spend an action for any of the following: reading up to 1000 words, analyzing complex art, rolling Appraise to value an item after handling or touching it, rolling Sense Motive to sense enchantment when an enchanted creature passes within close range (this check should be made in secret by the GM), and rolling Sense Motive to make a hunch after one round speaking to them. In addition, you may more rapidly perform tasks that require continual analysis, allowing you to follow tracks at any speed without penalty or perform research in half the usual time. At a GM's discretion, other similar skill checks and uses can benefit from this talent. Old Mind Feats Click the header above to visit the Sphere-Focused Feats page.

    "terrifying mind (cognition) [sa:bg]": {
      "benefits": "Source:   Spheres Apocrypha: Banshee's Gasp Whenever you succeed a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you may spend 1 spell point as a free action that can be taken outside of your turn to terrify the source of that effect, provided you can identify and see the effect's source. This causes the creature to be shaken for 1 round per caster level. A successful Will save negates this effect. At 10th caster level, the creature is instead frightened for 1 round per caster level, and on a successful save the creature is still shaken for one round per caster level. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Additionally, you may spend 1 spell point as a standard action to ready your mind, and grant yourself a +2 morale bonus to all saving throws made against mind-affecting effects for the next 24 hours. This bonus is doubled against fear effects. This bonus increases by +1 at 8th caster level and every 8 levels thereafter. Advanced Mind Talents Advanced talents are part of an optional rule and are only available with GM permission."

    "catatonia [catgirl hb]": {
      "benefits": "You wrap the weary kittens in a soft and warm blanket so they might drift off to sleep. Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Powerful Charm, Sleep (charm)), caster level 10th. Whenever you use the Sleep (charm) powerful charm, you may spend an additional spell point. If you do, the duration of this (charm) effect becomes permanent. Whenever the sleeping target would receive a new Will saving throw to wake up, they roll twice on their saving throw, taking the worse result. A target put to sleep this way does not receive a +4 on their saving throw to wake up. If your permanent Mind sphere caster level is 15th or higher, a creature who fails their saving throw against a Sleep (charm) powerful charm modified with this advanced talent may only receive a single new Will saving throw to wake up every 24 hours (such as through an attempt to rouse or from taking damage)."
    },
    "deadly vision (charm)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Vision (charm)), caster level 10th. As a greater charm, you may spend 2 spell points to give the target a vision of the most fearsome creature imaginable, pulling its subconscious fears into a shape before its eyes. Only the target can see this vision, although you may see the vague shape of the creature the target is seeing. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. This is a fear effect."
    },
    "discern alien cognition [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisite:  Mind sphere. You may spend 1 spell point to have a Mind sphere effect you create ignore any immunity to fear, sleep, paralysis, and mind-affecting effects that a creature possesses as a result of a racial ability or subtype. This does not allow you to affect creatures whose creature type is immune to mind-affecting effects (for example, a character with this talent could charm a sinspawn or a chernobue qlippoth, but not an iron golem or an id ooze)."
    },
    "epiphany (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Intuit Knowledge), caster level 5th. When you attempt an ability or skill check to gain information (such as a Knowledge check, Profession checks to answer questions, or Diplomacy checks to gather information) you may spend a spell point to bend your entire mind to the task. The GM then determines the success or failure of the roll secretly. If the check is successful, for each five caster levels you possess you learn an additional detail or piece of related information (such as additional rumors about a city or the casting tradition of a magical effect you have identified). On a failed check you still learn the information a basic success would have revealed. However, the GM may then remove a single detail from the information gained or reveal a piece of false information alongside true information (such as revealing a real ability of a monster and a fake vulnerability during a monster lore check, or telling a player all the rules of etiquette for a situation except for one)."
    },
    "flawless precision (cognition) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Arcane Calculation, Rapid Processing), caster level 10th. By spending 2 spell points as a standard action you may enter a heightened state of mind. In this state you can analyze and measure all aspects of your surroundings effortlessly, allowing you to use the benefits of Rapid Processing as if you had spent a spell point on it. Further, once per round as a free action you may use Arcane Calculation as if you had used Perception to intentionally search for stimuli. Finally, you gain a pool of rerolls equal to your casting ability modifier; you may spend a reroll once per failed attack roll, ability check, skill check, or saving throw to reroll it, always keeping the second result. The effect of this talent last for 1 minute per caster level. Old Mind Drawbacks Click the header above to see the Sphere-Specific Drawbacks for this sphere. If you're using the optional Casting Tradition rules, Drawbacks allow you to acquire one or more bonus talents in a sphere in exchange for a limit on using this sphere.

    "greater communication": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th. So long as you are personally familiar with the subject, you may spend an additional spell point to use your Project Thoughts charm across any distance, even across planes (although there is a 5% chance a cross-planar sending simply does not arrive). Recipients are allowed to respond in kind, but the target must voluntarily receive and send the messages; the target may simply decide to block you out, in which case the conversation immediately ends. You no longer require line of sight or line of effect when using the Project Thoughts charm when you are personally familiar with the target."
    },
    "insanity": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Confusion (charm)), caster level 10th. When applying a Confusion charm to a target, you may spend an additional spell point to change this charm into an instantaneous effect. The charm has no duration and cannot be dispelled. This cannot be removed except through the Make Whole advanced Life talent or through a similar effect such as a greater restoration spell."
    },
    "memetic link": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Enthrall (charm), Mass Charm [mass], Powerful Charm, Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th. When you place a powerful Enthrall charm on a target, you may spend an extra spell point at the time of casting to create a memetic link between you and the target. This link allows the target, if they have access to the Mind sphere, enchantment spells, or similar mind-affecting effects, to treat both itself and you as the caster of any such mind-affecting effects that they produce. All calculations involving caster level, saving throw DCs, magic skill checks, and other similar concerns related to the actual casting still use the target's own casting ability, but you are treated as the caster for the purposes of the results. (For example: If your target uses the Read Mind charm on another target, you would both gain the information gleaned from the secondary target's mind.) If your target possesses Memetic Link as well, he or she may cede control of an Enthrall charm he or she casts to you as well, creating a potential chain of enthralled targets, though such a chain may only go as long as your casting ability modifier (not counting yourself)."
    },
    "mind control": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Enthrall (charm), Powerful Charm, Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th. When you place a powerful Enthrall charm on a target, you may spend an additional spell point to increase the duration to 1 day per caster level. In addition, the target obeys all commands you give it, except for obviously suicidal ones. Commands that are against the target's nature grant it a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to throw off the entire effect. You may communicate your requests telepathically to the target (if you do not have a shared language, you can only communicate basic commands such as 'go', 'fight', 'stand still', etc.). This can be done over any distance once established, but not across planes. By concentrating fully on the effect (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, and if you possess the Read Mind talent and Greater Communication advanced talent, it can communicate with you. You cannot actually see through the subject's eyes, but it still gives you a general idea of what's going on. If you do not spend at least 1 round concentrating on the creature each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off your control."
    },
    "psychic backlash [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Psychic Vengeance). When you use Psychic Vengeance in response to a charm effect, you may use the charm talent that was targeting you as part of Psychic Vengeance even if you do not possess the talent yourself."
    },
    "recondite stimuli": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere, caster level 1st. You can reach the minds of creatures thought, by some, to be untouchable by the mental arts. When you gain this talent, you may choose plants and oozes, or one creature type from the following list: constructs, vermin, or undead. Once selected, you may affect creatures of that creature type with your charms and other mind-affecting effects, bypassing any type-based immunity to mind-affecting effects these creatures may have, and treating mindless creatures as having an Intelligence score of 1 for the purposes of Mind sphere talents. Special:  This talent may be selected more than once. Each time, a different creature type must be selected."
    },
    "zeitgeist (cloud)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Mass Charm [mass], Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th. You may spend an additional 1, 2, or 3 spell points and take 10 minutes to affect large communities of 200 or smaller, 2,000 or smaller, or 5,000 or smaller (respectively) with a single lesser or greater version of a charm. Every individual within this community of 3 or fewer Hit Dice is automatically affected by this charm, while everyone with 4 or more Hit Dice receives a Will save as normal with a +4 bonus. This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. Note:  GMs using the Zeitgeist talent to create an enthralled thorpe or all-too-sleepy little village are encouraged to not roll the Will saves until player characters arrive \"on screen\", and to recall that many, many NPC citizens will have fewer than 3 Hit Dice and not be permitted a save. Waiting for the PCs to arrive will save prep time and cut down on NPC note mismanagement, even if you do realize that a plot-crucial NPC was actually unaffected and should have been active elsewhere from time to time. Mind Sphere Feats"
    },
    "backdoor control (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Enhancement sphere (Bestow Intelligence (enhance)), Mind sphere (Expanded Charm). Benefit:  Whenever you use a charm against a creature or object you successfully used Bestow Intelligence on, requests you make that would normally be against their nature are instead treated as things they would not normally do. This increased control extends to creatures you create through advanced magic, such as Bestow Life, Duplicate, or Give Magic Life."
    },
    "deceptive advisor": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisite:  Mind sphere. Benefit:  When you attempt to influence the attitude of an individual with the Diplomacy skill or deceive an individual with the Bluff skill, your very words are laced with deceptive, incantatory cadences. As a swift action, you may cause a target within 30 feet of you to attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your Mind sphere caster level + your casting ability modifier. Failure means that your Bluff checks are treated as if your statements are one step more reasonable to the target (for example, an impossible lie that would ordinarily impose a -20 penalty to your Bluff checks would instead be treated as merely far-fetched and would only impose a -10 penalty to your Bluff check). In addition, failure means that the target is treated as one stage friendlier to you for the purposes of shifting his or her attitude by one step (for instance, changing the attitude of a creature from unfriendly to indifferent normally requires a DC equal to 20 + the creature's Charisma modifier, but would now only require a DC equal to 15 + the creature's Charisma modifier). These effects last a number of hours equal to your casting ability modifier, but the normal rules for the frequency with which a creature may be influenced by Bluff or Diplomacy are still in effect. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect."
    },
    "doublespeak (dual sphere) [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "What might spell doom for one listener brings the greatest of joy to another. Prerequisites:  Fate sphere (Echoing Word [mass]), Mind sphere; or Fate sphere, Mind sphere (Mass Charm [mass]). Benefit:  When you use a charm, cloud, or word, you may spend 1 additional spell point to affect the target, targets, or creatures in the area with a different charm, cloud, or word you may create if they are of a certain alignment (designations may include specifications such as lawful good, any good, or any nongood). Creatures of that alignment are instead affected by a different charm or cloud effect of your choice of the same strength that you may create, or a word you may cast, chosen when you cast the first effect. You must spend spell points for the secondary effect as normal."
    },
    "dreamspace (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere, Warp sphere. Benefit:  When you sleep, you may choose to project your mind into a quasi-real space, or dreamspace. This dreamspace is a single 10-foot cube in size (increasing by a single 10-foot cube every 4 character levels, their arrangement determined when you level) and you can select the ambient light level, temperature, and cosmetic style when entering the dreamspace or as a standard action. The cosmetic style of your dreamspace is only partially under your control, reflecting your current dreams, state of your mind, and conscious desires. When you use an action to adjust the style it will always reflect your intended changes, but you do not have fine control over its appearance and your unconscious mind may be reflected in its subtler elements. You can choose to have it appear as a castle, but not a specific castle or place you have seen, and if you are worried it may appear to be under siege or shrouded in shadow. You interact with the dreamspace using a copy of your body and all you wear, leaving behind your physical body in the real world. You may also choose to bring up to a heavy load of unattended, inanimate objects within touch range into your dreamspace with you, causing them to disappear when you fall asleep, and may choose to bring them back in a similar manner when you wake. Your dreamspace and any items left within it persist even while you are not in it, though they enter stasis until you return. Because the dreamspace is not a true physical location, you cannot take any actions that would cause you to leave the dreamspace other than waking up, or that would affect your body or the real world. In addition, the dreamspace cannot be entered using normal teleportation or planeshifting effects. At the GM's discretion, effects allowing travel to normal dreams can enter the dreamspace, and it may count as a dreamscape for certain effects. Otherwise, actions have their normal effects in the dreamspace. Regardless of how you spend your time in dreamspace, you gain the normal benefits of sleep."

    "fool\u2019s counterspell (counterspell)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere or Mind sphere; Counterspell. Benefit:  When you successfully counter a spell, the caster must succeed at a Will save equal to your Illusion sphere DC or Mind sphere DC (whichever is greater), or believe the spell had its intended effect, even if they would otherwise be aware of its failure. Treat this effect as a figment with a duration equal to the countered spell, and use the rules for interacting with and investigating figments."
    },
    "hypnotic darkness (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Dark sphere (Looming Darkness (blot, darkness)), Mind sphere. Benefit:  Those within your darkness are particularly vulnerable to your charms. Your areas of darkness and blot are always treated as if imbued with Looming Darkness when you use the Confusion, Fear, or Sleep charms."
    },
    "hypochondriac\u2019s terror (dual sphere) [crimdan]": {
      "benefits": "When you take over a creature's bodily functions, you may also blend in your mental manipulation to torture them from the inside out. Prerequisites:  Blood sphere, Mind sphere, caster level 5th. Benefit:  When you successfully establish blood control on a target, you may spend a spell point as a swift action to manipulate their mind, granting them a Will save against your Mind sphere DC. On failure, their body's response system is under your control for the duration of the blood control. If used alongside Mass Blood Magic, you may affect any amount of creatures with this feat, but must pay the additional spell point per creature you affect. When the creature fails their Will save against this feat, you select an ailment for the creature to suffer from, chosen from the following: Fight or Flight:  The target is shaken until the start of their next turn. \n Hallucination:  If you possess the Visions talent, you may cause the creature to suffer as if they failed a save against the Vision lesser charm, but the effects only persist for one round. \n Pustule Burst:  The target suffers nonlethal damage equal to 1d4 + half your caster level with the Blood sphere. \n Queasy:  The target is sickened until the start of their next turn. \n Spasm:  The target moves 5 feet in any direction you choose. You cannot move the target into a square that is intrinsically dangerous or into an obstacle, and the target may still take a 5-foot step afterwards. \n Twitches:  If you possess the Gestures talent, you may cause the creature to suffer as if they failed a save against the Gestures lesser charm, but the effects only persist for one round. The target suffers from that ailment at the beginning of each of its turns. You may change the ailment as a free action. Additionally, whenever you successfully use a (still) or (quicken) ability on the target, you may cause them to suffer from an additional ailment for one round."
    },
    "implausible deniability (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Illusion sphere (Manipulate Aura (sensory, magic), Programmed Illusion), Mind sphere. Benefit:  You may have your illusions interact with Detect Thoughts and similar abilities as if they had an Intelligence score of up to twice your caster level. Whenever you place a glamer on a creature, you may spend an additional spell point to create an illusionary mind complete with false memories, including a false Intelligence score (for this purpose creatures with an Intelligence 0 are treated as invisible to effects such as thoughtsense). When a creature attempts to extract information directly from the mind or compel honest responses of anyone under the effects of glamers modified by this feat, they must first attempt a magic skill check against your magic skill defense. Failure indicates the information or response given is any information of your choosing, even false information. You do not need to be aware of the mental intrusion or compulsion to choose the information gained. The illusionary mind added to glamers modified by this feat constantly broadcasts misleading information. Abilities that would grant an insight bonus to attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, skill checks or armor class against the glamered creature instead incur a penalty of equal value. This also applies to any effects that rely on mind reading such as the battlefield relay symbiat class feature. Special:  If you possess the persuasive class feature you may add the bonus to save DC's to Illusion sphere abilities. This feat counts as a talent with the (Sensory: Mind) tag."
    },
    "mental aura [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "Your very presence can be enough to exert your inhuman will on others. Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Mass Charm [mass]). Benefit:  You may create an effect known as a mental aura attached to yourself or to other creatures by spending a spell point. A mental aura functions as a cloud attached to a creature (with the normal radius of 10 feet in radius + an extra 5 feet per caster level) except that it becomes inactive if that creature is knocked unconscious and is dispelled if they are killed. Mental auras continue to function if they go beyond the range of their creator. The mental aura has a duration of concentration or 1 minute per caster level if you spend an additional spell point. Any creature that enters or starts its turn in a mental aura is affected by a single lesser charm that you can create (chosen at the time you create the aura). At your discretion, you may choose to omit allies or enemies from the effects of the mental aura. Creatures are allowed saving throws as normal to negate the effects of these charms. For effects that are dependent upon input or orders by the caster (such as Suggestion or Command), this input is decided when the mental aura is created. A creature that has been affected by a mental aura cannot be affected by the same aura again (or the charm it replicated) for 24 hours. Effects such as Minor Charm Specialist which would increase the number of times a creature may be affected by a charm increase the number of times they may be affected by mental aura as if it were a charm. The recipient must be within touch range or within close range if you possess the Ranged Mind talent). An unwilling creature can have a mental aura attached to them as a touch attack and they may attempt a Will save to negate the effect initially. A successful save in this context ends the mental aura immediately. An enemy which fails their saving throw to have a mental aura attached to them is considered to have failed the saving throw to avoid being affected if the creator of the mental aura allows them to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent a mental aura from being attached to a creature."
    },
    "mental cloud": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere (Mass Charm). Benefit:  You may spend 2 spell points to manifest a (charm) as an actual, literal cloud of mental energy. This cloud has a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels, centered within your maximum charm range, and lasts for 1 minute per caster level. This cloud does not obscure sight or grant concealment, and the cloud remains for 1 minute per caster level. A moderate wind ( 11+ mph) will disperse it within 4 rounds, while a strong wind (21+ mph) will dissipate it at the start of your next turn. Whenever a legal creature enters this cloud (including allies, enemies, or even yourself) or begins their turn inside it, they become subject to the charm and may attempt a saving throw if allowed and desired. Once a creature has either saved against or become subject to the charm, they cannot be affected again even if they remain with the cloud or leave and return."
    },
    "mind over matter (combat)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere, caster level 5th. Benefit:  When you take hit point damage and are not flat-footed against the damage's source, you may choose to spend spell points as a free action (even when it is not your turn) to delay some or all of the damage, effectively nullifying it for the moment when it occurs. For every spell point spent, you may delay an amount of damage equal to twice your Mind caster level (meaning a level 7 thaumaturge could delay 28 points of damage by spending 2 spell points). The damage is delayed for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. In addition, by spending a spell point as a standard action, you may will your metabolic functions to respond differently. You may delay the effect of poison on yourself by altering its frequency by one step (rounds to minutes, minutes to hours, or hours to days, only usable once per poison), you may use your casting ability score instead of Constitution for holding your breath, and you may add your casting ability modifier as a bonus to checks to disguise your health under close observation (such as when feigning death). This is treated as a supernatural ability. Any delayed damage can be taken at a point prior to the expiration of the delay by dismissing the effect, as if dismissing a spell. Healing received while damage is delayed can preemptively negate the damage before the effect ends if you wish. If an attack's damage is negated entirely, secondary effects of the damage are also negated if the secondary effect would be negated through damage reduction."

About Dreamscapes Some of the material on this site will reference dreamscapes, subrealities that exist within the minds of most sentient beings, often whether they are aware that they exist or not. No one knows exactly how or why dreamscapes first came to be, but they seem to exist as interconnected islands of psychic energy separated by an unknown sea of consciousness that has, so far, defied most attempts at classification by scholars of the arcane. The rules for dreamscapes closely resemble the rules for mindscapes as found in Paizo's Occult Adventures, though most fall into the category of overt immersive mindscapes. Dreamscapes similarly assume that they are located not on the Astral plane, but rather on the plane of whoever creates them unless physical travel to one's own dreamscape occurs. These demiplanes may be located through scrying or similar divination effects just as if scrying on the dreamer who causes the dreamscape to exist. For the most part, the material that references dreamscapes will work just as well for the mindscape, but varying outside of the overt immersive category may lead to unexpected results. Dream safely! One noteworthy variation from the mindscape rules is the inclusion of thought constructs. These metaphysical structures of pure thought and dream are usually purely aesthetic, but some provide noticeable benefits (or potentially detriments) to the one who has them in their dreamscape, and they are sometimes built with the intention of protecting a dreamscape (or people within it) from certain kinds of threats, or to allow the dreamscapes to function in new ways. The small number of examples here may be added to with GM permission, either through player research or as a potential story element. The majority of thought constructs are aesthetic and offer no (or negligible) benefits, such as a cottage, windmill, small castle, tree, or even clouds that provide gentle rains. Thought constructs that provide active bonuses or significant changes impart some mental strain, and as such an individual may only have a number of these notably beneficial thought constructs equal to their highest mental ability score modifier. Thought constructs are metaphysically tangible, and have some substance that visitors to the dreamscapes can manipulate. Regular attacks or talents won't hurt them, but for those attacks specifically designed to harm thought constructs or do damage in a dreamscape, treat the \"typical\" thought construct as having hit points equal to ten times the dreamscape owner's highest mental ability score modifier. Thought constructs designated as resilient may have up to double this amount, and ones designated as fragile as little as half. A thought construct reduced to half its hit points or less becomes non-functional, and one reduced to zero hit points ceases to exist. The constructs will heal themselves over time, restoring health equal to its owner's highest mental ability score modifier every day that the creature doesn't experience extreme confusion, fear, intimidation, or other similarly stressors. Finally, the knowledge of an individual's dreamscape is a powerful thing in the wrong hands, but the complexities involved make keeping track of that knowledge baffling to some. Scrying on an individual, with the intent to discover their dreamscape, is the most common way to learn the coordinates of a dreamscape, as opposed to that which one normally determines via scrying. One's capacity for understanding the metaphysical \"space\" of a dreamscapes is limited in a manner similar to that of knowing spells (see  Spellcrafting ). Apart from the location of one's own dreamscape, which is always intuitively known, the location of other dreamscapes takes up the same mental space as a spell known via Spellcrafting. Learning a dreamscape's coordinates beyond this limit requires either forgetting a previously known set of coordinates, or copying coordinates into a spellbook as per the Craft Spellbook feat. (For most purposes, treat this as a spell with only the Mind sphere as a prerequisite. For each point of an individual's mental ability modifiers above 3, and each time an individual has the Sphere Focus or Spell Focus feats, increase the complexity of the spell by 1 (as if the theoretical spell required an additional talent)). Example:  An incanter with an Intelligence of 20 and a Wisdom of 18, plus the Sphere Focus (Mind) feat would have the coordinates of his dreamscape treated as a spell with a complexity of 5 (Mind sphere + 4 talents), meaning his coordinates would take up 5 pages and require 5 hours to copy."

    "suggestion [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may plant thoughts into a target's mind. Lesser Charm:  You may plant a suggestion in a target's mind, which they obey as if the thought had been their own (Will negates). The suggested course of activity must be limited to a sentence or two and must be a very simple request. The creature performs the suggested action until it finishes, or for 1 hour per caster level, whichever comes first. If you choose, you can instead specify conditions the creature should look for, (i.e., \"you should search the next person who enters this room, looking for weapons.\") If the condition is not met before this duration expires, the activity is not performed. Greater Charm:  This is the same as the Suggestion lesser charm, but may be up to a basic request. Very simple requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty. The target cannot be asked to do anything it would not normally do. Powerful Charm:  This is the same as the Suggestion lesser charm, but the creature obeys any course of action given, so long as the suggestion is not obviously fatal or against the target's nature. Basic requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty, while very simple requests cause the save to be made with a -4 penalty. Some mind talents are designated (charm) talents. These talents grant you additional charms you may place on targets. Cloud Talents marked with the (cloud) tag allow the caster to create clouds of mental energy that emanate from an area, object, or creature. Creatures are not affected by a cloud unless they enter its area, or otherwise interact with the cloud in a fashion designated by the talent. You may imbue an area, object, or creature at close range with a cloud. An imbued item may be no larger than 5 cubic ft. per caster level in size. A creature may be up to the caster's size + 1 size category for every 5 caster levels. It is possible to imbue a portion of an item or creature (a single head of a massive, two-headed dragon or a single segment of a lengthy carpet with blood smeared over it, for instance) but hiding a portion of an item or creature won't prevent the whole of it from being noticed. Unless otherwise specified, a cloud's radius extends from an item or creature as if the creature was the center of an imbued area measured as a radius. An imbued area may either be 10 ft. in radius + an extra 5 ft. per caster level, or a 10-ft. wide area that extends for a length of 10 ft. + 10 ft. per caster level (such as would be appropriate to fill a 10 ft. wide hallway). Establishing a cloud requires a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. As with charms, most clouds have three strengths; lesser, greater, and powerful. Spell point expenditures remain the same for the three strengths, and you may only affect a creature with a cloud if you could also affect it with a charm. Similarly, the Powerful Charm talent is required to use the powerful versions of clouds and you may only imbue the same item, creature, or area with a lesser cloud once per day. With the exception of Group Charm, cloud talents are affected by talents that affect charms. Cognition [Apoc] Some talents are marked (cognition). These talents grant you additional mental powers, increasing your ability to analyze and think. All (cognition) talents are personal range, benefiting only the person that uses them. Mind Talents"

You can communicate with the target even without a shared language."

Targets who take damage automatically wake up, and other creatures may wake a sleeping creature as a standard action. Powerful Charm:  The target is placed into a deeper slumber.

Lesser Charm:  You may alter a creature's perception of a single creature, object, sound, or effect for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). You may alter 1 sense (sight, sound, touch/pain, taste, smell); for example, you could make a thief appear to be an alley cat, make a scratch appear as a gaping knife wound, or make the sound of footsteps seem like the wind. You cannot use this to replicate speech or sights and sounds you have never encountered before, nor to make something invisible. If used to cover up pain (such as hiding the target taking damage) the target gains a +4 bonus to their Will save. If the target interacts with the object of their altered perception, they are allowed an additional save every round they continue to do so. Greater Charm:  This functions as the Vision lesser charm, except you may affect all 5 senses in relation to the chosen creature, object, sound, or effect.

      "benefits": "Breeze:  Concentration, requires air. You create a light wind that remains swirling around a target. The breeze grants the target a circumstance bonus equal to 2 + 1 per 5 caster levels on saves against very hot conditions, severe heat, and saves against clouds, vapors, and gases (such as cloudkill, stinking cloud, and inhaled poisons). Gust Of Wind:  Concentration, requires air. You may create a line-shaped gust of wind emanating out from you out to the edge of your geomancing range, affecting all creatures and objects within that line. The severity level of the wind is 3 + 1 per 5 caster levels (see the Wind category of the Weather sphere for more information). If maintaining Gust Of Wind via concentration, you may spend a spell point as a free action to increase the severity level of its wind by 1 for that round. Walls and other barriers block this wind. Author's Note:  If Gust Of Wind is used in an area of existing wind severity level 3 or greater, the geomancing ability may have different effects depending upon what direction your line-shaped gust is blowing versus the existing weather. Gust Of Wind blowing in same direction of Existing Wind: instead increase the wind severity in the line-shaped gust by 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. \n Gust Of Wind blowing in opposite direction of Existing Wind: instead decrease the wind severity in the line-shaped gust by 3 + 1 per 5 caster levels. \n Gust Of Wind blowing in perpendicular directions of Existing Wind: Gust Of Wind overrides the existing wind severity and direction in that line-shaped gust, but otherwise remains unchanged. Purify Air:  Concentration, requires air, gas, or vaporous substance. You may convert polluted air or a non-breathable gas or vapor into a cloud of breathable air in a 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels radius area centered within range. This has no effect on supernatural or other magically created clouds (such as a vampire's gaseous form or a cloudkill spell). Creatures who are entirely within the area of the cloud are able to breathe in sufficient air to sustain them."

This functions as Entangle from the (plant) package, but on a failure targets cannot move but do not become entangled. Each subsequent round they do not escape and this effect is still active, the Strength and Escape Artist DC increases by 1. After 10 rounds or if the target is knocked prone within this area and fails their save, they are considered buried and begin to suffocate until they escape. Dust Storm:  Concentration, requires sand or loose dirt. You kick up sand or dirt within a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. All creatures fully within this area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss chance). If creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area, the targets also have concealment. Tremor:  Instantaneous, requires dirt or stone. You may spend a spell point to send a tremor through the ground, affecting a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. Targets standing within this area must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone."

    "fire": {
      "benefits": "Affect Fire:  Concentration, requires fire. You may affect a normal, non-magical fire, increasing or decreasing its size by one category, plus one per 5 caster levels. This is only a temporary change; once the effect ends, the fire returns to its normal size. Reducing a fire smaller than Fine extinguishes it, in which case it does not return to normal size after the effect ends. The fire consumes fuel and deals damage as appropriate for its new size, according to Table: Maximum Fire Size. Creatures caught in the fire's area are allowed a Reflex save for half damage. The minimum caster level required to affect a fire is also given in the chart. If two casters are affecting the same fire in the same direction (increasing or decreasing) only the strongest change occurs. If two casters attempt to Affect Fire in opposite directions (one making it bigger, one making it smaller), the second caster must succeed at a magic skill check. On a success, their ability functions normally, overlapping the first caster's effect. The fire counts as its altered size for determining if the second caster can affect it. Note:  If multiple fires overlap, or if a Large or larger creature is affected by multiple smaller fires within its area at once, these fires combine to determine the effective size of the fire when determining damage (2 Small fires make 1 Medium fire, 2 Medium fires make 1 Large fire, etc.). If a creature has caught on fire, treat that fire as being Tiny-sized for the purpose of this effect. When you affect a fire on a creature, you also raise or lower the Reflex save DC to put the fire out by 1/2 your caster level (minimum 0).

This fire may be 1 size category larger per 5 caster levels, and may be used to ignite flammable materials to create self-sustaining, non-magical fire. If a target is within the area of the created fire, they suffer damage as normal for that fire's size and catch fire. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates catching fire. Manipulate Lava:  Instantaneous or concentration, requires lava. You may manipulate lava. This is exactly the same as the Freeze and Vortex powers from the (water) package, except you must spend an additional spell point for each ability, and you must target lava. Frozen lava becomes obsidian, with a hardness of 5 and 3 hit points per caster level and does not deal damage per round to trapped creatures."

    "metal": {
      "benefits": "Magnetize:  Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard action, you may cause a creature or object within your geomancing range consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to fly towards a creature or object of your choice within your geomancing range. This can only be used on unattended objects, attended objects from willing creatures, or willing creatures consisting mostly of metal. You may choose to throw the item harmlessly (in which case it can either be caught by the target or else lands in an adjacent square), or you may use this as a ranged attack action. This counts as a ranged attack, except you must use your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity. If successful, you deal either the object's 'ore damage', or if it is a weapon, the weapon's damage (arrows and bolts with metal tips count as daggers for this purpose, dealing 1d4 damage). Despite the name of this ability, the target object or creature need not be made of metal. Recover Ore:  Instantaneous, requires dirt or sand. As a standard action, you may create a piece of metal ore by pulling and combining particles of metal from the ground. You must spend a spell point to use this ability, and must have a large enough piece of earth (sand or dirt) to pull the ore from. This piece of ore can be brass, bronze, copper, or tin, and the size of the ore recovered depends both on your caster level and the square footage of earth you pull from. The piece of ore you recover is formed on the ground in an unoccupied space within range and can be of any basic shape (a ball, a rod, a sheet, even a chair) but cannot be anything complex or with moving parts. You may also pull multiple pieces of ore placed in different adjacent squares, so long as their combined size does not exceed your maximum, and each piece of recovered ore must be of the same type (such as copper or tin). For these purposes, 2 Fine-sized pieces of ore equals 1 Diminutive-sized piece, etc. While this effect is instantaneous and thus cannot be dispelled, ore breaks back into particles after 1 hour per caster level. If a piece of ore is used as a weapon, it counts as an improvised weapon, dealing either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen at the time of Recovery. The damage such a weapon deals is listed as 'ore damage' in the chart below. As always, improvised weapons bestow a -4 penalty to attack rolls.

The Value of Recovered Ore:  Ore recovered through the (metal) package from the Nature sphere is of poor quality and degrades quickly, making it impossible to simply create and sell. However, players who possess a metal-based Craft or Profession skill such as Craft (weapons) or Profession (blacksmith) can heat and purify this ore to make it workable. This allows such a character to attempt Craft or Profession checks to earn a wage even without the presence of a market or workshop to work in. Rather than earning money, the check instead creates an amount of raw materials equal to that day or week's wage, which may be sold later or used as raw materials for any metal-based crafting. Reforge:  Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to cause an unattended object (or object that you are holding) consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to be reshaped into a different object of the same size. For example, you could reshape a longsword into a mace. You may not reshape metal objects into forms with complex moving parts. If targeting a magical item, the effect is not instantaneous, but lasts for only 1 minute before the object reverts to its original form. If reshaping a magical item would make it no longer qualify for specific enhancements, those enhancements are suppressed for the effect's duration. Reforge does not function on artifacts."

    "plant": {
      "benefits": "Entangle:  Concentration, requires grass, weeds, vines, or underbrush. You cause plants to grow rapidly, wrapping themselves around everything in a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. Creatures within this area must succeed at a Reflex save or gain the entangled condition and become unable to move. Creatures that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of each turn you maintain the effect. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can break free as a move action, if they succeed at a Strength or Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the effect's Reflex save DC. This area is also considered difficult terrain for the duration of the effect. If the area contained plants with thorns, all creatures suffer 1 point of piercing damage each round they are within this area. Harvest:  Instantaneous, requires fruit trees, berry bushes, or food crops. You may spend a spell point to cause plants to sprout food spontaneously. You may affect up to 1 plant per caster level within range. Each plant produces enough food to provide 3 Medium-sized creatures or 1 horse with food for a day. Pummel:  Concentration, requires a tree. You cause a tree branch to come alive and attack a foe you designate. The tree cannot move, but it makes one slam attack each round against the designated target until you spend a move action to designate another target or until the target dies or moves out of range. Slam attacks from the pummel deal damage as if it were a primary attack, may be enhanced as a natural weapon as if the tree branch were a creature, and are not subject to spell resistance. You cannot designate a target you cannot perceive. The branch has a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level, and a to-hit modifier equal to your caster level + its Strength modifier + its size modifier. You may animate a Medium branch at 1st caster level, and your maximum size increases by 1 category per 5 caster levels. An entire tree can count as a branch, provided the tree is not larger than your maximum Pummel size. In place of animating a branch of Large-size or larger, you may animate a pair of branches that are two sizes or smaller on the same tree. You can only do this once per branch that you otherwise could animate with pummel. For example, at CL 20, when targeting a Colossal tree, they can choose to animate: 1 Colossal-sized branch, or 2 Huge-sized branches, or 2 Large-sized branches, or 2 Medium-sized branches, etc. Branches are still objects, and as such always fail saving throws, can gain the broken condition (suffering a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls), and are destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Note:  There are very few worlds, even among fantasy, where trees exist that are Colossal+ or larger. However, a caster of particularly high caster level may still subdivide larger branches into smaller branches using Table: Number of Branches Per Size Category of Tree as a guide. For example, a Colossal++ tree would have 1d4 (avg 3) Colossal-sized branches, 3d4 (avg 8) Huge-sized branches, and 9d4 (avg 23) Large-sized branches. Regardless of your caster level, or the size of the tree, you cannot animate a branch that is larger than Colossal-sized. Note:  Primary natural attacks usually get a 1.5x Strength multiplier for their damage. See the rules on natural attacks in the CRB for more information on this.

    "water": {
      "benefits": "Blood Sphere Note:  If you possess both the Nature sphere (water) package and the Blood sphere, you may treat a volume of blood as an equal volume of water for your (water) geomancing abilities. You may treat a creature susceptible to bleed damage that is taking bleed damage or below half its maximum hit points as being wet for any ability that requires it. You may treat a creature susceptible to bleed damage of at least Large size (count two Medium creatures as a Large creature, two Small creatures as a Medium creature, etc.) that is suffering bleed damage or below half its maximum hit points as a sufficient volume to use the Fog ability. Fog:  Concentration, requires rain, mist, or at least 5 cubic feet of water. You call up a rolling fog, cutting off people's vision within a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). The ability does not function underwater. If using a body of water, the fog must be at least partially over the water itself. If you spend a spell point to maintain this effect without concentration, a moderate wind (11+ mph) will disperse it within 4 rounds. In the presence of a strong wind (21+ mph), you cannot use this ability. Freeze:  Instantaneous, requires water. You may spend a spell point to flash freeze water, turning it into ice. You may freeze a 1 inch thick, 5-foot-by-5-foot square of water per caster level. Alternatively, you may cover a wet Medium-sized creature with 1 inch of ice per caster level. You may increase the size of the frozen area or size/number of the frozen creatures, but divide the ice's thickness by the equivalent number of Medium-sized creatures. Creatures smaller than Medium count as Medium-sized creatures for this effect, with the exception of multiple creatures occupying the same space. Add the sizes of multiple creatures occupying the same space together when determining their size for this purpose. For swarms, count each 5-foot square as being 2 Medium-sized creatures occupying the same space. You may affect both squares and creatures, but all affected targets and spaces must be contiguous and must have the same thickness of ice. Creatures are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being frozen. On a failure, they are encased and cannot move, and suffer 1 point of cold damage per round per inch of ice. To escape, they must succeed at a Strength check or Escape Artist check as a full-round action to escape the ice (DC 15 +1 per inch of thickness) or another creature must break the ice around the trapped creature (3 hit points per inch). While encased, a target can only take mental or verbal actions, or attempt to escape. Being encased in ice blocks line of effect, but not line of sight (the creature may still be targeted, but effects that deal damage to the target must break through the ice first before dealing damage to the target). On a successful save, the target is still entangled for 1 round. Ice melts 1 inch of thickness per minute on the average day. When freezing ice or wet ground, you may also create slick ice. A creature traversing slick ice must spend two squares of movement to first enter a space with ice, and cannot move more than half speed without a successful DC 15 Acrobatic check at the start of the movement, falling prone on a failure. Running or charging requires a DC 20 Acrobatics check, falling prone on a failure, but increasing the runner's move across the ice by 10 feet if successful by 5 or more, though the runner is considered flat-footed until the start of its next turn.).

You may create a spinning vortex in a body of liquid that sucks creatures and objects to its center. This vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, is 10 feet high + 5 feet per 5 caster levels, and is half as wide at the top as it is high. Any creature entering this area must succeed at a Reflex save or suffer bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 0). If the creature is smaller than the vortex, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or be pulled into the middle of the vortex. Creatures in the middle of the vortex suffer bludgeoning damage once per round with no save, and must succeed at a Reflex save each round or be unable to move, and on a success may only move at half their swim speed. A vortex cannot contain more creatures than would exceed its volume. You may move the vortex up to 30 feet per round as part of the action required to concentrate on it. If maintaining the effect through a method other than concentration, you may designate a simple pattern for it to move, which you may alter as a move action. Creatures in the middle of the vortex are carried along with it as it moves. Nature Talent Types Some talents are marked (air), (earth), (fire), (metal), (plant), or (water).

You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."

    "air mastery (air, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "When you use the Gust Of Wind ability, you may create a cone area of effect instead of a line. Additionally, you gain the following geomancing abilities: Absorbing Inhalation:  Concentration. You may, as a standard action, grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar cloud-like effect during the duration of the talent. The cloud-like effect can have no larger of a radius than 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a magic skill check to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal breathable air in its place. Gaseous creatures gain a Reflex save to avoid being inhaled. This talent can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to utilize the talent in response. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for as long as the talent remains active, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration (gaseous creatures are immediately and harmlessly exhaled should their gaseous form expire in the nearest empty space). As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60- foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, attempting saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud immediately ends the duration of this talent. If you do not exhale the cloud before this talent's duration expires, you suffer the cloud's effects, automatically fail any saving throw made to resist it, and exhaling any gaseous creatures inhaled into the nearest empty space. Feather Fall:  Concentration, requires air. You cause all falling creatures or objects within a 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels radius to fall slowly, changing the rate at which they fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet). The targets take no damage upon landing while this talent is in effect. Once applied, this effect stays with the individually affected targets until the duration expires. You may use this ability as an immediate action by spending a spell point."

    "aquatic adept (water, geomancing, spirit) [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "You gain several abilities which improve your capacity to operate underwater. Adjust Buoyancy (spirit):  You may spend 1 spell point to change your buoyancy to swiftly rising, neutral, or swiftly sinking for 10 minutes per level (see the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for rules on buoyancy). Your buoyancy does not change based on what equipment you are carrying. As a standard action, you may change your buoyancy again (alongside the buoyancy of any other willing creatures affected by this spirit). Aquatic Mire (geomancing):  You may create fog effects underwater, in which case they function as they normally would in the air. Instead of wind, currents can disperse an underwater fog; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a fog in 1 round. Create Current (geomancing):  If you have the (air) package, you may use the gust of wind ability underwater, creating a current of equal speed and range to the gust of wind you could create (see the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for rules on currents). Deep Adaptation (spirit):  You adapt incredibly quickly to changes in pressure, taking no damage from pressure effects. In addition, you can move and attack underwater normally without the usual penalties involved with underwater combat, as if under the effects of freedom of movement (this does not grant you the other benefits of the spell). This benefit lasts for as long as you concentrate or 10 minutes per caster level if you spend 1 spell point. Echoes of the Sea (spirit):  You may spend 1 spell point to gain the ability to track creatures through the water as if across soft ground as long as they passed through the area less than 1 week ago (this lets you notice trails that are much older than normal underwater trails). You retain this benefit for 1 hour per caster level."

    "breeze mastery (air, geomancing) [eo3]": {
      "benefits": "When using Breeze, you may spend a spell point to have it affect an area, granting its benefits to all creatures within a 15-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. Additionally, when you use Breeze, you may add any of the following additional effects depending on what other packages you possess. Air: Stable Winds:  Requires air. You can create incredibly powerful winds, allowing you to walk upon the air with some difficulty as long as you concentrate. You can spend a spell point to allow yourself to walk on air as if walking on solid ground, with moving upward being similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, which is at a rate equal to half your normal land speed. Wind of severity level 3 or higher can blow you away regardless of your size, with any checks required (such as a Strength or Fly check) using your casting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier used for the check. You begin to fall as normal if you stop concentrating on this effect. Earth: Stabilizing Dustveil:  Requires sand or loose dirt. You can create winds made up of fine particles of dust and sand, stabilizing the area around you. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to your CMD against bull rush, reposition, trip, and overrun combat maneuvers made against you. Additionally, you treat the first square of difficult terrain you enter every round as if it were normal terrain. Fire: Warm Breeze:  Your breeze is heated to ward against the chill. Instead of the normal bonus to saves against very hot conditions or severe heat, Breeze instead grants this bonus to saves against very cold conditions and severe cold. Additionally, when used in this way, creatures affected by your Breeze treat the severity of all cold and precipitation weather effects as one step less severe, plus one per 10 caster levels you possess. Metal: Ferrous Zephyr:  Requires metal. You can create a breeze filled with fine filaments of metal. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to your AC and to saving throws against electricity-based effects. Additionally, you ignore the penalties associated with the broken condition with any of your worn or wielded equipment (but is still considered broken regardless) as long as the Breeze is active. Plant: Fragrant Flurry:  Requires grass, vines, or weeds. Your breeze smells of pleasant meadows and flowers, and causes vines and flowers to grow where it touches. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to saving throws against the nauseated and sickened conditions and any harmful effects that rely on smell. Additionally, the DC required to track creatures affected by Breeze increases by an amount equal to the circumstance bonus granted by Breeze. Water: Cooling Breeze:  Requires rain, mist, or at least 5 cubic feet of water. Creatures affected by your Breeze treat the severity of all aridity and heat weather effects as one step less severe, plus one per 10 caster levels you possess."

    "create nature (geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to create your geomancing element anywhere within range. While this is its own geomancing ability, it may also be combined with another geomancing ability as part of the same action, in which case the second geomancing ability comes into effect immediately, using the created element to meet the second ability's prerequisites. You must pay any costs associated with both abilities to combine them in this manner. Create Nature counts as a geomancing ability or effect belonging to the package being used. Air: Create Air:  You create a cloud of air. This creates one 5-foot cube per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 cube) of breathable air. The created cloud of air will immediately displace other gases, liquids, and vapors in the area, but will shortly thereafter behave as normal air. For example, if this talent is used underwater, the created air cloud will form a bubble that will begin to ascend to the surface. Earth: Granulate:  You create enough loose dirt or sand to cover a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area. You may reduce the spell point cost by 1 (minimum 0 spell points) if you choose to break apart rock and stone within this area (reducing their thickness by 1 inch, +1 inch per 5 caster levels), instead of creating the dirt or sand spontaneously. Collapsing Structures \nGenerally speaking, single castings of Create Nature (earth) on stone structures will not be enough to compromise the structural integrity of a building. Should half of the structure's load bearing columns, keystones, or walls be reduced to half thickness or less, a weakened area is created. Those who notice the weakened area (with a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) or Knowledge (engineering) check) may exacerbate the situation by destroying half of the structure's load-bearing objects, triggering a cave-in or collapse. Rules for the cave-in and collapse hazard can be found in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide. Fire:  While the (fire) package already has the power to Create Fire, you may now combine Create Fire with another geomancing ability, as outlined above. This can include using Affect Fire and Create Fire at the same time to create truly powerful fires. Unlike the uses listed above, you do not need to spend a spell point to combine Create Fire and other geomancing abilities as part of the same action. Metal:  You may now use Recover Ore in conjunction with other geomancing abilities, as outlined above, though doing so increases the cost of Recover Ore to 2 spell points instead of 1. Hemoglobin:  You may create metal ore out of a living creature's essence. Target a living corporeal creature within your geomancing range. To use hemoglobin, make a ranged touch attack against the target, inflicting 1d2 Constitution damage to the target (Fortitude save for half damage). The die size of the Constitution damage increases by 1 step for every 5 caster levels (1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). Regardless of the creature's size or bodily composition, you Recover Ore of Fine size upon successfully hitting the target. While the name of this ability suggests the target must bleed or have blood, it is not necessary; the only requirement is that the creature be corporeal and living. If the target is immune to ability damage, you still Recover Ore of Fine size. Plant: Grow Plants:  You spontaneously grow plants. This may create one tree (to a maximum size equal to that which you can control through the Pummel geomancing ability) or a field of plants within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area. This may create basic plants (corn, underbrush, ivy) and may be combined with Harvest to create edible food, but cannot create plants with inherent qualities (i.e., you cannot create rare herbs, etc.). Water: Create Water:  You create a pool of water. You create one 5-foot cube per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 cube) of clean water. Using this ability in conjunction with Vortex can create a vortex that travels on land, so long as it is always touching the ground. Using this ability in conjunction with Freeze can allow you to create walls of ice by freezing vertical spaces as you would normally do horizontal spaces. These walls cover the same area and have the same hit points as usual, but may be arranged in a contiguous wall no more than 5 feet high per inch of thickness."

    "earth mastery (earth, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Increase the maximum radius of your Bury and Tremor by an additional 5 feet per 5 caster levels. Additionally, you gain the following geomancing abilities: Unearth:  Concentration, requires dirt or stone. You may manipulate the earth surrounding a burrowing or buried creature or object, forcing them to be pushed or pulled 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels each round towards the surface (Fortitude negates). While affected, the target is unable to burrow or earth glide on its own, but is otherwise unimpeded. You may only target a creature or object whose location you have pinpointed (such as with a successful Perception check or with tremorsense). Unless the target has earth glide, the creature cannot be forcefully moved through stone (or lava if the target possesses fire resistance 20+ or fire immunity), but rather only sand or dirt. Each round, the target is allowed a new Fortitude save to end the effect. Sandstone:  Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point to transform dirt or sand into stone in an area within range. The size of the created rock or stone depends both on your caster level and the radius of dirt or sand you target. Alternatively, you may encase a dirt or sand covered target in 1 inch thick stone. Refer to Table: Sandstone to determine the maximum target size to be encased. For every size smaller the encased target is than the required radius of dirt or sand, either double the thickness of the stone or increase the number of encased targets. Creatures and objects are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being trapped in stone. On a failure, creatures or objects caught in the area are encased; to escape, they must succeed at an Escape Artist or Strength check (equal to your Bury geomancing DC) as a full-round action; alternatively, a creature may break free by dealing sufficient damage to the rock or stone. Stone has a hardness of 15 and 2 hit points per inch. On a successful save, affected targets are still entangled and immobilized until they escape or 1 minute per caster level, whichever comes first.

    "elevated nature (geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Your geomancing abilities can now affect greater depths and heights; rocks fly, vines reach, and fire blazes in such a way as to affect creatures at much higher or lower elevations than normal. When using Entangle or Tremor, you may affect flying creatures up to 10 feet per caster level over the effect. Affected creatures must succeed at a Fly check (DC 15 + caster level) or fall; Entangle pulls targets harmlessly to the ground and entangles them as normal, while Tremor causes targets to suffer falling damage. When creating a Vortex, increase the height to 10 feet + 10 feet per caster level. The top of the vortex is 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels wide, though the base of the vortex is still 5 feet. When using Affect Fire, you may cause the fire to manifest as a pillar, reaching 10 feet per caster level into the air. When using Gust Of Wind you may create the gust as a column with a radius of 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels and a height of 10 feet per caster level, centered anywhere within your geomancing range. When using Magnetize, double the range you can target."
    },
    "fire mastery (fire, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "You gain a number of ways of expressing mastery over fire. You gain the following geomancing abilities: Alter Light:  Concentration. You may alter the light produced by a fire within your Affect Fire maximum. You may halve or double the radius of its light, as well as change its granted light from an emanation to a cone of double its light radius. You may also increase its granted light by 1 level (usually to bright light) or decrease its granted light by 1 level (to dim light). Extinguish:  Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point to extinguish any and all fires within your geomancing range that are within your Affect Fire maximum, as you desire. Reflash:  Instantaneous. If a non-magical fire within range would become extinguished (through magical or mundane means), you may, as an immediate action, cause the fire to relight in up to a 15-foot radius burst of flame dealing fire damage equal to the largest sized fire you can create. This can be used to reignite a character who has caught on fire and extinguished the flames. If so, a successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates catching fire."
    },
    "fog mastery (water, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "When you create Fog, you may add one of the following additional effects depending on what other packages you possess. Air: Wind Blades:  Your fog attacks those inside it with blades of wind. Any creature or object moving through this fog must succeed at a Reflex save or suffer 1d6 + 1 per 2 caster levels points of slashing damage for every 5 feet of movement spent entering or moving through this fog. Earth: Sandstorm:  Requires loose dirt or sand instead of water. You create a sandstorm. In addition to the fog, this also functions as a Vortex, except it travels over land and extends into the air, and can even leave the ground and travel in the air. The obscuring effect only applies to the actual area of the vortex, and creatures that possess earthsight or tremorsense do not have their vision obscured by this effect. Fire: Smokescreen:  Requires fire instead of water. You may create a fog out of smoke instead of mist. Creatures that begin their turn within or enter the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or become blinded for 1 minute. In addition, creatures suffer \u20132 penalty on attack rolls and Perception checks for as long as they remain inside and for 1 round after exiting the smoke. Creatures that possess firesight do not have their vision obscured by clouds modified with this effect. Metal: Acid Rain:  You may spend an additional spell point to create acid rain. An acid fog deals 1d6 acid damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6, no save) to creatures inside it. This fog deals damage when you first create it and each subsequent round at the beginning of your turn. Any creature who enters the cloud immediately suffers damage, but only once even if they leave and re-enter the cloud as part of their movement. Creatures that possess metalsight do not have their vision obscured by this effect. Plant: Spore Cloud:  Requires grass, weeds, or trees instead of water. You may create a cloud of spores. Creatures that begin their turn within or enter the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for as long as they remain within the fog + 1d6 rounds after leaving. If a creature fails its Fortitude save against this effect while already sickened, it also becomes nauseated for 1 round. Creatures and objects that exit the cloud are covered in visible sticky spores that remain until removed as a full-round action; outlining their form and revealing their position, and making invisibility impossible without first cleaning off the spores. Creatures that possess greensight or plantsight do not have their vision obscured by this effect. Water: Solid Fog:  You may make your fog so thick that it becomes effectively solid. Creatures move at half their speed through the fog, cannot make 5-foot steps, and suffer a -1 penalty to all weapon attacks and damage rolls made within or that pass through this area -1 per 10 caster levels. Objects that fall within this area are slowed so that each 10 feet of fog reduces the falling damage by 1d6, +1d6 per 10 caster levels."
    },
    "hazardous terrain (geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "You know how to make many of your geomancing abilities particularly dangerous. When using the Freeze or Tremor geomancing abilities, you may cause the affected area to grow spike-like formations which last 1 round per caster level. If using Freeze on creatures, this affects the spaces adjacent to where they are standing. Freeze can't create both spikes and slippery ice in the same space. Whenever a creature steps onto an affected square, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half due to its wounded feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it enters the affected area. A creature may move at half speed through this area without risking damage to itself. When using Entangle you may cause the effect to grow thorns, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your caster level per round to all creatures inside the effect. Those who succeed at their Reflex save against the Entangle take half damage. When using Affect Fire or Create Fire, increase the space the fire occupies as if it were one size category larger than it actually is. Finally, when using Magnetize you may target a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area instead of a single target. When used in this way, Magnetize becomes a concentration effect. Any target who enters or begins their turn within this area is attacked by the metal object, as if using the Magnetize ability. These attacks are not attack actions. A single creature can only be attacked once per round in this way, no matter how many times they pass through the affected area during their movement. While this effect is active, attempting to grab or impede the Magnetized object requires a successful grapple (CMD equals 10 + your caster level + your casting ability modifier + any size benefit or penalty from the object)."
    },
    "manipulate nature (geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "You may manipulate the elements to take on different shapes. The types and forms you can create are determined by your Nature packages, as outlined below: Air: Air Geyser:  Instantaneous, requires air. You may, as a standard action, create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging a Medium-sized or smaller target within range upward into the air (Reflex negates). If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of air hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 x your caster level (or 10 x your caster level if you spend an additional spell point). If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object taking 1d6 damage per 10 feet that the target was not hurled upward. For example, if a creature would be hurled 20 feet into the air but hits a ceiling at 10 feet, the target would take 1d6 damage. After this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as normal. The maximum size of the target increases by 1 size category every 5 caster levels. Earth: Forge Earth:  Instantaneous, requires ground. You may spend a spell point to alter the ground within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range. You may raise or lower the terrain up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels, and may create variants within the affected area such as summoning a small wall or creating gradients and stair effects. You cannot both raise and lower the terrain with the same use of this ability and cannot create variants in anything smaller than 5-foot squares (i.e., you cannot create 1-foot diameter holes or create a spike of earth). Targets within this area are not damaged by falling if you lower the terrain, and climbing up the edges of lowered terrain usually requires a DC 15 Climb check. Fire: Move Fire:  Concentration. You may move a fire within your Affect Fire size up to 10 feet per caster level per round in whatever manner and direction you desire. A fire moved in this way continues to burn, even without fuel (although it may be drowned or extinguished otherwise as normal), and dies as soon as the effect ends if not moved to a new fuel source. If you have spent a spell point to make this use of Affect Fire self-sustaining, directing the fire is still a move action. When moving fire to or through a space occupied by a creature, that creature suffers the fire's damage and catches on fire (Reflex for half damage and to not catch on fire). A creature can only be affected once per round by a fire, no matter how many times the fire moves through their space. If you can Affect Fire or Create Fire, you may Move Fire as part of those geomancing effects. Metal: Pin-ball:  When using the Magnetize geomancing ability as a weapon, if the attack hits you may spend a spell point as a free action to Magnetize another creature within range and make a ranged attack at that creature. These additional attacks are not attack actions. The number of granted attacks increases by +1 per 5 caster levels, but if you miss once the pin-ball ability ends without any further attacks. You may not make ranged attacks with the pin-ball ability two or more times in a row against the same target. Plant: Shelter:  Instantaneous, requires tree or branch. You may spend a spell point to reshape a tree to create a shelter. Use the Pummel geomancing ability to determine the hit points and size of a shelter based on the tree used (the radius of the shelter is the reach of the tree or branch used). Creatures and equipment under the shelter suffer no harm from being in a hot or cold environment, and can exist comfortably in conditions between \u201350 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (-45.5 and 60 degrees Celsius) without having to attempt Fortitude saves. In addition, the shelter provides protection against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth, however the vessel does not protect against any environmental damage such as cold or fire damage. The shelter also provides cover (+4 AC, +2 Reflex saves) to and from those inside, and hostile creatures cannot enter the shelter without first destroying the shelter. However, if the tree or branch used to create the shelter is destroyed, the effects of the shelter immediately end. Author's Note:  The Shelter geomancing ability is intended to work similarly to the Secure Shelter spell. As such, incorporeal creatures should be able enter the shelter without forcing their way in. Similarly, the shelter should not inherently restrict creatures from teleporting into the structure provided that the teleporting creature meets all other requirements, such as line of sight, etc. Water: Wave:  Instantaneous, requires water. You may create a surge in water that pushes targets in its wake. This surge may be created anywhere within range and may face any direction, but once created it travels in a straight line for a distance of 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. This area may extend out of the water and onto land to a maximum of 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. The wave created is 5 feet wide. The width may be doubled by halving the length. This may be done multiple times, but the length cannot become smaller than 5 feet. A target cannot be pushed back further than the wave's length. All creatures within the affected area are pushed as if by a bull rush combat maneuver, except it does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Use your caster level + your casting ability modifier in place of your CMB. If the target is on land and is successfully pushed by this ability, they must also succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. If combined with Create Water, it may be created anywhere and may travel up to 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels over land."

    "metal mastery (metal, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you use Recover Ore, you gain the ability to Recover Ore of iron, lead, or steel. Upon reaching caster level 5th, you add cold iron and silver to the types of ore you may recover. At caster level 10th, you gain the ability to recover mithral ore. When using Magnetize, you may also affect the metal object with Reforge with the same action, spending a spell point to transform the metal object into a more dangerous form. The object may take the form of a specific weapon of your choice, or simply into a dangerous form which deals bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage and deals double the ore damage normal for its size. You also gain the following geomancing ability: Fortify:  Instantaneous. You may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to fortify an unattended object (even non-metal objects) within range. The target becomes fused with metal, permanently increasing or decreasing the hardness and AC of the object by 1, +1 per 5 caster levels. An object may only be under the effects of one fortify at a time, as each future casting dismisses and replaces the previous casting. This grants no further benefit or penalties due to the metals used."

When using a geomancing ability dependent on size (such as Affect Fire, Create Fire, Magnetize, Pummel, or Recover Ore), increase the maximum size object you can create or target by 1 size category. When using Freeze, you may affect twice as many equivalent Medium-sized creatures without affecting the thickness of the ice. Author's Note:  You can apply this effect to each applicable effect. For example, if using the Create Nature talent to both Create Fire and Affect Fire, both abilities will receive the size increases from the Nature Lord talent"

    "plant mastery (plant, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Your mastery of plantlife becomes even more pronounced. Increase the maximum radius of your Entangle by an additional 5 feet per 5 caster levels. When using Pummel, you may spend an additional spell point. If you do, you may affect an additional number of branches equal to 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. When using Harvest, you may produce 2 magical berries per caster level, along with the usual food. Any creature who consumes one of these berries is healed 1 hit point. These berries lose their magical potency after 24 hours."

    "pummel mastery (plant, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "You may direct your animated branches to attack as a free action instead of a move action. In addition, you may cause a branch to perform any of the following actions instead of making an attack. Aggravating Vegetation:  You may instruct the vegetation to focus on antagonizing its target instead of making a regular attack. The branch or tree makes an attack roll as an antagonize check against the target's Psychology DC (10 + Hit Dice + Wisdom modifier; or 10 + Sense Motive bonus, if it is higher). Unlike a normal antagonize check, you do not suffer a \u20134 penalty on antagonize attempts made against opponents of a different creature type or that are of animal intelligence (Intelligence 1 or 2). Creatures who have been previously antagonized gain a +4 bonus to their Psychology DC. Mindless creatures are immune to the effects of antagonize. Antagonize is a mind-affecting effect. If you successfully beat the target's Psychology DC, the creature, instead of taking damage, gains the antagonized condition against the attacking vegetation. The antagonized condition remains for 1 round. The duration of this condition increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat your opponent's Psychology DC. Antagonized Condition:  The antagonized condition appears in Ultimate Charisma, published and copyrighted by Everyman's Game, LLC. An antagonized creature can only target its antagonist (the one who caused the antagonized condition) with hostile actions. A hostile action is any attack or effect that causes direct harm to an opponent in the form of damage, negative conditions, or any other effect that penalizes or hinders a creature. Furthermore, an antagonized creature does not threaten any opponents except its antagonist: it cannot make attacks of opportunity or be used to determine flanking bonuses against other opponents. A creature is no longer antagonized if its antagonist is helpless, unconscious, or cannot participate in combat. If an antagonizes creature uses an ability that targets multiple creatures, the antagonist must be chosen among these targets. If an antagonized creature uses an ability that targets an area, its antagonist must be within the ability's targeted area. On each round after the first, an antagonized creature may attempt a Sense Motive skill check as a swift action to realize the folly of its actions. This skill check is opposed by the antagonist's original antagonize skill check. If the creature succeeds on its Sense Motive skill check, the antagonized condition ends, but the creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty to the saving throw DC of its abilities and any spells it casts for 1 minute. These penalties do not apply against the antagonist. Sap Conglutination:  Instead of a regular attack, you may instruct the vegetation to excrete a rubbery resin and attempt to coat the target with it.

If a fatigued creature becomes coated with sap a second time, they gain the exhausted condition until the sap is removed as a full-round action."

    "purify nature (geomancing) [warden]": {
      "benefits": "You may purify the nature around you, making brackish water drinkable, poisonous plants edible, and hazardous air breathable. Air: Improved Purify Air:  You may spend a spell point to cast Purify Air as an instantaneous effect, causing the affected area to be purified of any toxins indefinitely (not accounting for the natural spreading of such gases). Additionally, whenever you concentrate on Purify Air, you may choose to center the sphere effect's radius on yourself. If the air you are attempting to purify is magical in nature (including fog and clouds), you must attempt a magic skill check against the magic skill defense of the caster (the MSD of a supernatural effect is 11 + the CR of the effect's source). On a success, all negative effects such as concealment or damage are removed from the purified air. Earth: Cultivate Soil:  If you possess the (earth) package, as an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to cause the soil within a 20-foot radius, plus 10 feet per 4 caster levels you possess to churn and enrich itself, allowing the soil to be used to grow plantlife. If the earth you are attempting to purify is cursed or poisoned, you must attempt a magic skill check against the magic skill defense of the effect, or the DC of the poison (if any). On a success, the curse or poison is dispelled and removed from the affected area. Fire: Purifying Heat:  If you possess the (fire) package, as an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to attempt to purify any toxins within a creature's bloodstream using extreme heat. You may attempt a magic skill check against the DC of each poison the target is suffering from. On a success, the poison is neutralized. Metal: Pure Metals:  If you possess the (metal) package, whenever you would use Recover Ore to gain materials to earn a wage using an appropriate Craft or Profession skill, you earn double your check result in gold pieces worth of raw materials, instead of half your check result. Additionally, you may use Reforge to completely remove all rust and damage on a non-magical metal object, removing the broken condition from the object and causing it to regain 1d4 hit points, +1 additional hit point per 4 caster levels you possess. If you possess Reforge Mastery, this increases to 1d6 + 1/2 your caster level hit points. Plant: Purify Food:  If you possess the (plant) package, as an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to purify all food within a 10-foot radius, plus 5 feet per 4 caster levels you possess, making spoiled, rotten, or otherwise contaminated food edible. If the food you are attempting to purify is poisoned or diseased, you must attempt a magic skill check against the DC of the poison or disease. On a success, the poison or disease is removed from the food. Water: Purify Water:  If you possess the (water) package, as an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to purify all water within a 10-foot radius, plus 5 feet per 4 caster levels you possess of brackish, stagnant, or otherwise contaminated water. If the water you are attempting to purify is poisoned or diseased, you must attempt a magic skill check against the DC of the poison or disease. On a success, the poison or disease is removed from the water."

    "reforge mastery (metal, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "As a concentration effect, you may use a limited form of Reforge that can even affect attended objects. When targeting an attended object, you may apply one of the following effects. Reforged Edge:  You may target a weapon and affect its critical hit threat range, increasing or decreasing it by 1, +1 per 10 caster levels. This bonus or detriment is applied after abilities and feats such as Improved Critical or the keen weapon special ability, and cannot be doubled. If this would decrease a weapon's critical hit threat range below 1, the weapon instead has its critical hit multiplier decreased by 1 for every point it is reduced below 1 (minimum x1 crit multiplier). Author's Note:  This sphere effect can increase the critical threat range of a weapon to be higher than normally possible (such as 12\u201320 with a sufficiently high caster level). By GM discretion, a GM can adjust this talent to not increase the critical threat range of an altered weapon higher than 15\u201320. Reforged Reach:  You may target a weapon and increase the weapon's reach by up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels. Chill Metal:  If you possess the (water) package, you may target a piece of metal or mostly-metal equipment and decrease its temperature. Any creature who begins their round touching the chilled metal takes 1d6 cold damage per 2 caster levels. If the chilled metal is something they are holding such as a sword or coin, they may attempt a Reflex save to drop the item to take only minimum damage, otherwise, the creature may attempt a Fortitude save for half damage. Worn equipment such as armor cannot be dropped in this fashion. If the object is used as a weapon, it deals an additional 1d6 cold damage. If this ability is used on a metal object with moving parts (such as a door's hinges), those pieces become non-functional as they freeze together, requiring a Strength check to beat your MSD to break loose and restore functionality. Heat Metal:  If you possess the (fire) package, you may heat metal. This functions the same as chill metal, except dealing fire damage instead of cold damage, and moving parts cease functionality due to being slightly welded rather than frozen."

    "repress element (geomancing) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "Source:   Spheres Apocrypha: Battlefield Manipulation Talents As a concentration effect, you may temporarily obliterate an element within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area within range. Creatures of a subtype corresponding to a repressed element are nauseated for the duration of the repression unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (this saving throw is made as soon as they enter the area of repression). Any effect with a descriptor corresponding to the repressed element does not manifest within the area unless the caster succeeds at a magical skill check. Additional effects apply depending on the element repressed. Air: Vacuum Generation:  The area becomes a vacuum, preventing creatures from breathing or sound (including sonic effects) from moving through the area. Characters cannot cast with verbal components in the vacuum. Starting at caster level 5th, all creatures in the area of the created vacuum take 1d6 bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 5 caster levels thereafter. Creatures who remain within this area must save at the end of your subsequent turns or suffer damage again. If a creature enters this area after its creation, it also suffers this damage. A creature may only be affected by the damage from vacuum once per round, regardless of how many times they enter or exit the area that turn. Creatures that need air to breathe suffer from suffocation in a vacuum as normal. At caster level 10th, all creatures that suffer damage from the vacuum must succeed at a Fortitude save or become fatigued. \n Earth: Disintegrate Earth:  Stone and crystalline entities begin to phase out of existence, weakening their defenses. All stone or crystalline objects in the area have their hardness reduced by half your caster level and creatures made of stone or crystal have any DR and natural armor bonuses they possess reduced by half your caster level (minimum 0). Weapons made of stone or crystal deal damage as if they were one size smaller plus an additional size smaller per 5 caster levels (minimum of 1 damage) and AC bonuses granted by armor and shields made of crystal or stone is reduced by half your caster level (minimum 0). A creature is allowed a Fortitude save to negate the effects of this ability on themself and any equipment they are carrying (although they must save again if they leave and re-enter the area). \n Fire: Heat Drain:  Combustions are negated in the area. For the duration of the effect, all non-magical fires in the area are extinguished (although they can re-ignite when the effect ends). Any fire damage taken by creatures in the area is halved. All light in the area is decreased by one step plus an additional step for every 5 caster levels you possess. At caster level 10th, electricity damage and damage from explosives is reduced in the same manner as fire damage. \n Metal: Disintegrate Metal:  As Disintegrate Earth, save that the effects apply to creatures and equipment made of metal rather than stone or crystal. \n Plant: Disintegrate Flora:  As Disintegrate Earth, save that the effects apply to creatures and equipment made of wood, vines, or other plant-based materials rather than stone or crystal. \n Water: Evaporation:  The area becomes immensely dry, causing all unattended liquid in the area to evaporate (although it may return to liquid state when the effect ends). Living creatures in the area take a -2 penalty on Fortitude saves. This penalty increases by 1 per 5 caster levels. At caster level 10th, even attended liquids like potions dry up temporarily in the area, although owners are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect for as long as they remain in the area (although they must save again if they leave and re-enter the area)."

    "riding fog (water, geomancing) [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may create clouds of fog attached to yourself or to other creatures. A fog cloud attached to a creature is called a riding fog. This functions as a regular fog and can be dispersed by wind, except that it moves with the creature it is attached to, becomes inactive if that creature is knocked unconscious and is dispelled if they are killed. The fog continues to function if it goes beyond the range of its creator. The recipient must be within range of your geomancing. An unwilling creature can have a riding fog attached to them as a touch attack; A creature is allowed a Will save to prevent having the fog attached to them and may attempt another saving throw each round to end the fog. The Break Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or a similar effect can dispel the riding fog before its natural duration expires. An enemy with a riding fog attached to them still receives any saving throws the fog allows to avoid being affected. A successful save causes the fog to immediately dissipate. Spell resistance can prevent a riding fog from being attached to a creature. Failing to bypass the intended target's spell resistance in attempting to attach the fog dispels the fog."

    "temperature (fire, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Your control over fire extends to a level of mastery over temperature. You gain the following geomancing abilities. Trail Blaze:  Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point to create a wave of ash, hot air and smoke in 120-foot line which reveals a safe path to traverse, allowing creatures to ignore difficult terrain within the affected area for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Creatures who are caught in the area of effect when first cast must attempt a Fortitude save or become exhausted, creatures that succeed at their saves become fatigued instead. Boil Water:  Concentration, you must possess the (water) package. you may, as a standard action, cause a 5-foot cube of water per 2 caster levels (minimum one 5-foot cube) within range to heat up and boil, dealing 1d6 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6, no save) fire damage to any creature within. Each round at the beginning of your turn, any creature still within the boiling water suffers damage again. If a creature enters the boiling water, they immediately suffer damage, but only once during their movement, no matter how many times that movement takes them in and out of the boiling water. Melt Earth:  Concentration, you must possess the (earth) package. You may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to melt the surface of a 5-foot square of sand, dirt, or stone, plus another contiguous 5-foot square per 5 caster levels, transmuting the top inch per caster level into lava. This is not enough lava to create vortexes. Creatures who enter this square or begin their turn in this square suffer 1d6 fire damage per caster level (Reflex half, targets who are in the square when the lava is created may instead attempt a Reflex save to move out of the space and avoid all damage). Even after a creature leaves the lava, creatures who failed a saving throw against this lava suffer half damage each round for 1d3 rounds (no save). A creature may spend a full-round action to remove the lava and end this effect for future rounds. If a creature is within this square when the effect ends, the earth instantly cools around the creature, immobilizing it (Reflex negates). An immobilized creature cannot move until it succeeds at Strength or Escape Artist check against the caster's Nature DC, both of which require a full-round action. Alternatively, another creature may attempt a Strength check as a standard action to break the earth, or any creature may deal 5 damage per caster level to the earth to break it."

    "water mastery (water, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Your mastery of water is delicate and intricate. You may manipulate snow as if it were liquid water. In addition, you gain the following geomancing abilities: Air Bubble:  Concentration, requires both water and air, meaning it usually must be used at the water's surface. You may fold water in such a way that it traps air inside of it. This can take one of two forms: You may create either an individual air bubble around a creature's head, or create a large bubble measuring up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels in radius. You may move this bubble as if it were a Vortex. An individual air bubble allows a creature to breathe underwater for 1 hour normally, but otherwise does not impede swimming. A larger air bubble traps significantly more air, and allows those inside to remain dry and walk on the ground at the bottom of the body of water as if it were ground. A large air bubble contains enough air for a Medium creature to breathe normally for 6 hours per 5 feet in the bubble's radius. Slow Suffocation:  A medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes. Each additional medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Once rendered unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the character begins to take lethal damage at the same rate. Small characters consume half as much air as medium characters. Push Swimmer:  Instantaneous. You may move creatures and objects within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area that are surrounded or submerged in water up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels in any direction that ends with them still in water (Reflex negates if unwilling). A target slammed into a solid object suffers 1d6 falling damage per 10 feet of movement. Spirit Talents"

    "destroy element (spirit)": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may spend a spell point to remove and deconstruct your elements. This requires a melee or ranged touch attack against a target within your geomancing range. You may use the following abilities depending on what packages you possess. Air: Suffocation:  You pull the breath from a living creature's lungs. The target is allowed a Fortitude save to resist, and on a failure is staggered and is left unable to speak, use breath weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or perform any other action requiring breath for 1d4 rounds, +1 per 2 caster levels. If a target is unable to breathe for long enough, they may begin to suffocate, as detailed in the Gamemastery Guide. Earth: Shatter:  You may target an unattended, non-magical object, regardless of composition, of up to 10 lbs. per caster level and shatter it to pieces. This can be used to target objects attached to other objects (for example, a door or window), but cannot target a section of a larger object (for example, a portion of a stone wall). You may instead target a creature comprised mostly of stone or crystal; stone creatures suffer 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels while crystalline creatures suffer 1d6 damage per caster level (Fortitude half). Fire: Ash Strike:  You may generate a cone of ash that reaches from you to the edge of your geomancing range. This does not require a touch attack. This ash reveals invisible characters until they can wash off the ash or remove it as a full-round action (which provokes attacks of opportunity), and reveals the square invisible creatures are in if they walk on the ground, as they leave footprints in the ash. Targets struck by the ash strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds, or until they wash off or remove the ash as mentioned above. Metal: Oxidation:  You destroy a metal object or creature. If the target's size is one or more sizes larger than the size of ore that you can recover, the creature or object takes 1d8 damage per 2 caster levels (Fortitude half), otherwise the target takes 1d8 per caster level (Fortitude half). This damage overcomes any hardness the creature or object may have. If targeting an attended object, you must pass the touch attack roll and the target is allowed a Reflex save to negate damage. If an object receives sufficient damage to destroy it, it instead becomes non-functional for 1 minute per 2 caster levels, before returning to the broken condition with 1 hit point. Plant: Decompose:  You cause a living target's flesh to rot, possibly even growing mold and mushrooms. The target suffers 1d4 + 1 per 5 caster levels points of Constitution damage (Fortitude half). If a target fails their saving throw against this ability, all fast healing/magical healing/regeneration they gain is halved for 1 round per caster level (minimum 1). Water: Dehydration:  You suck the moisture from a living creature, causing it to suffer 1d6 nonlethal damage per caster level and become sickened for 1 round (Fortitude half). Oozes, plants, and creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes suffer lethal damage instead."

This breath weapon deals 1d8 damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d8), and allows a Reflex save for half damage. Using this breath weapon is a standard action, but you must wait at least 1d4 rounds between uses.

      "benefits": "Choose either animals or vermin. You may take this talent twice to gain both options. You may spend a spell point as a standard action to cause the chosen creature type to treat you as a friend for 1 minute per caster level. Indifferent creatures (such as domesticated animals or domesticated honeybees) become friendly to you, while unfriendly creatures (such as wild animals) become indifferent to you. This means that wild creatures will not attack unless provoked, and you may make requests of these creatures, provided you may communicate with them (if you cannot communicate with a creature, only basic commands such as 'go', 'come', 'fight', or 'stay' may be communicated). This has no effect on animals or vermin who are hostile to you (such as those already in combat), and a creature with a master (such as an animal companion) will still attack if commanded to by its master. Once during the duration of this ability, you may call the nearest animal or vermin (depending on the type chosen when this talent is taken) of a particular type you designate to seek you out. The creature's CR cannot exceed your caster level, though if you choose vermin you may summon a swarm with a CR no more than 1/2 your caster level. The creature moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close a creature of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal or vermin of that type capable of reaching you within this effect's duration, you are aware of this fact."

This does not affect ranged weapons that are unusually massive, such as boulders or siege weapons. Earth: Stoneskin:  You gain DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 your caster level. Once this has absorbed damage equal to 10 per caster level, it immediately ends even if its duration has not expired. Fire: Flame Mantle:  You place fire around yourself as a mantle. This does not deal fire damage to yourself, but all adjacent creatures take fire damage equal to the largest fire you can create at the end of each of your turns, and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Metal: Iron Body:  You wrap yourself in thick iron. You count as a creature comprised mostly of metal and gain a +6 armor bonus and a -3 armor check penalty, both of which increase by 1 per 4 caster levels, and you are considered to be wearing heavy armor, such as when calculating movement speed.

Plant: Barkskin:  You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor, +1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, in natural environments you gain a circumstance bonus to Stealth equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). You lose this circumstance bonus to Stealth in any round that you move more than 5 feet. Water: Seamantle:  You wrap water around yourself, gaining a circumstance bonus to Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, as well as to your CMD to avoid being grappled, equal to your caster level.

This ball can float up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels above the ground, and has a movement speed equal to your base land speed. This ball is only usable by you, but others may ride along if the ball can support the weight of all riders. The ball is treated as a mount, but requires no Ride or Fly checks to use and cannot be affected by uses of those skills such as cover or spur mount, nor can be targeted by opponents. Earth: Burrow:  You can tunnel through sand, loose soil, or gravel, at a burrow speed equal to half your land speed (minimum 10 feet) or at a burrow speed equal to a quarter of your land speed through stone (minimum 5 feet). While burrowing with this talent you cannot charge or run. This ability does not grant you the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material, you must hold your breath and take only short trips or else you may suffocate. Fire: Ride the Flames:  You may use heat waves to push yourself, gaining a fly speed equal to your base land speed, with a maneuverability of clumsy. This fly speed only functions on your turn. If you are not on a surface that can support you on the end of your turn, you glide safely to the ground, at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no falling damage. You cannot use this fly speed to hover. Metal: Ironshod:  You become difficult to impede with traps, hazards, and difficult terrain. You reduce any damage you take from traps, hazards, and difficult terrain (including caltrops and spike stones) by your caster level, and you can still 5-foot step through difficult terrain. When moving through difficult terrain, you may completely ignore 5 feet of difficult terrain + 5 feet per 5 caster levels when calculating your movement for a round. Plant: Brachiate:  You gain a climb speed equal to half your land speed (minimum 10 feet), granting you all the usual benefits of a Climb speed, including a racial +8 bonus to Climb checks. In addition, you can move through the upper canopies of jungles and forests with the same ease you move along the ground. You can use your base land speed to move through any heavily forested area without touching the ground by leaping and swinging from tree to tree. You can also use this among the rafters of a building, or even stalactites on a cavern ceiling. Water: Water Walk:  You gain the ability to walk on water. Water and all other liquid becomes solid to you, allowing you to move over it as if it were normal ground. Especially turbulent water (such as during a storm) may count as difficult terrain. You may always choose to sink into the water and swim if you so desire, in which case you are considered to have a Swim speed equal to your land speed, granting you all the usual benefits of a Swim speed, including a racial +8 bonus to Swim checks.

In addition to the effects that already possess a duration, if you possess the ability to grant (spirit) talent abilities to another you may spend a spell point as a standard action to grant a target the ability to use one of these attacks for 1 round per caster level.

Any creature damaged by the effect must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. Earth: Stone Fist:  As a free action you may encase one or both of your fists with stone for 1 round. While so encased, you cannot hold anything in that hand and suffer a -2 armor check penalty. You also are considered armed when making unarmed strikes with that hand, gain a +1 shield bonus to AC, and your unarmed strikes with that hand deal 1d6 damage Medium (1d4 Small) and ignore hardness less than 8. This damage increases by 1 die size (1d8, 1d10, 2d6, 2d8, etc.) every 4 caster levels you possess, and the shield bonus increases by 1 for every 6 caster levels you possess. This does not stack with monk levels or other effects that increase the damage of unarmed strikes. Fire: Fire Wielder:  As a free action you may create a fire in one or both of your hands. You are considered armed with this fire, and can treat it as a light weapon when making attacks. Attacks with this flame are touch attacks, and deal fire damage equal to the largest fire you can create with Create Fire. This fire cannot be augmented like a normal fire, and attacks with this fire are not augmented by your Strength modifier or effects that increase physical damage such as Power Attack, as flame is immaterial. You cannot be disarmed of this fire, but you may throw it as a ranged weapon attack with no range penalty to a maximum of your geomancing range. Metal: Blade Whip:  As a standard action you may reshape a mostly metal weapon (such as a sword or battleaxe) you are wielding into a cable and perform a trip, disarm or sunder combat maneuver against a target within your geomancing range. This is considered a ranged attack, and you cannot be targeted in return on a failure. You gain a bonus to the check equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). After the combat maneuver check has been resolved, your weapon returns to its original form. Plant: Bramble Strike:  You may spend a spell point as a standard action to cause brambles to burst from any mostly wooden weapon (such as a club, quarterstaff, or spear) you are wielding, or pieces of mostly-wooden ammunition such as an arrow or bolt coming from a ranged weapon you are using, for 1 round per caster level. Once per round when you strike a creature with one of your qualifying weapons, you may cause them to attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, the target becomes entangled for 1 round. For every 10 caster levels you possess, you may use this ability an additional time per round. Escaping this entanglement follows the same rules as escaping from the Entangle geomancing ability. If a creature fails their saving throw while already entangled from this effect, the condition's duration increases by 1 round. Water: Icicles:  You may spontaneously create an icicle in your hand as a free action. These icicles count as masterwork daggers and melt if they leave your hand for more than 1 round. These icicles gain a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels you possess (maximum +5) and deal an amount of extra cold damage equal to 1/2 your caster level."

Air: Speak With Clouds:  You gain the Auran language, and may speak with clouds of fog or mist. This is not truly accomplished with speech, but rather by interacting with the cloud you may learn what else has touched it, passed through it, is hidden within it, etc. You can tell depth, weight, size, and number of passers-by, but not more detailed information. Earth: Speak With Stone:  You gain the Terran language, and may speak with natural or worked stone.

Metal: Speak With Metal:  You gain the Aklo language, and may speak with natural ore or worked metal. This is not truly accomplished through speech, but rather by touching a piece of metal you may learn what else has touched it, worn it, passed by it, what is hidden inside it, details of its forging, etc. You can tell depth, weight, size, and number of passers-by, but not more detailed information. Plant: Speak With Plants:  You gain the Sylvan language, and may speak with normal plants and plant creatures. You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures and can ask questions and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it will not be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. Water: Speak With Water:  You gain the Aquan language, and may speak with pools or bodies of water. This is not truly accomplished through speech, but rather by dipping a limb into the water you may learn what else has touched it, passed by it, what is hidden inside it, etc. You can tell depth, weight, size, and number of passers-by, but not more detailed information.

      "benefits": "Choose either animals or vermin. You may spend a spell point to gain the ability to speak with your chosen creature type for 1 minute per caster level. You can ask questions of and receive answers from them, but this does not make them any more friendly than normal.

    "cyclone (air, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((air) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th. As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to create a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. This cyclone is 10 feet wide at the base, 30 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or spend an additional spell point to allow it to exist for 1 round per caster level without concentration, in which case you must specify a simple program (directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action). The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the effect's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You cannot regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released."
    },
    "earthquake (earth, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((earth) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th. As an instantaneous effect, you may spend 3 spell points to create an earthquake, affecting an 80-foot radius area. The powerful shockwave created by this ability knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground cannot move or attack. A caster on the ground must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster level) or lose any spell or sphere effect they try to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake depends on the nature of the terrain where it is created. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:  The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area who are below the falling debris and rubble. Cliffs:  The earthquake causes cliffs to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground:  Each creature standing in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the earthquake, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Suffocation rules in Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide for more details). Structure:  Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River, Lake, or Marsh:  Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of this effect, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. After the earthquake ends, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned Beneath Rubble:  Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must attempt a DC 15 Constitution check each minute thereafter until freed or dead, suffering 1d6 points of lethal damage for each failed save."

    "eternal steel (metal and plant, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((metal) package, (plant) package, Living Steel (advanced)), caster level 8th. As a standard action, you may spend 3 spell points to permanently grant one metal creature or metal object regeneration 1 (acid). The amount of regeneration increases by +1 per 10 caster levels. Damage caused by magical rust or oxidation count as acid damage for the purpose of suppressing this regeneration. Targets that lack a Constitution score (such as most metal constructs) still gain the regeneration from Eternal Steel, but instead of falling unconscious when their hit points are reduced to 0, they become helpless (or broken in the case of objects) until they recover enough hit points to put their hit point total back up above 0; If such targets have their regeneration suppressed while at 0 or less total hit points, they are destroyed."
    },
    "freezing geyser (fire, water, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((fire) and (water) package, Create Nature (geomancing), Temperature (fire, geomancing)), caster level 15th. This creates a burst of boiling water that snap-freezes once it has covered its targets. As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to create an eruption coming from a 10- foot square of solid ground within range. This deals 1d6 fire damage per caster level per round to all creatures within the 10-foot square and up to 30 feet above it. A successful Reflex save halves the damage, but creatures with evasion still suffer 3d6 fire damage on a successful save. Starting in the second round of the geyser's eruption, the rapidly cooling water begins raining down on all targets within 30 feet of the geyser, lasting for the length of the effect +1d3 rounds. Any creature caught in this freezing downpour takes 10d6 points of cold damage each round and is entangled by the layer of frost and ice forming on it. Even creatures affected by the main geyser who failed their Reflex save but left the area of cold rain find themselves entangled as the water on them freezes. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the entangled condition, but still deals 2d6 cold damage to creatures with evasion who successfully save. While a creature outside the affected area finds their entangled condition leaves after 1 round as the ice melts, creatures who remain within the affected area are affected each round, with each additional failed save causing its speed to be reduced by 10 feet. If the creature's speed reaches 0 feet, it is completely encased in ice, as the (water) package geomancing ability, with ice thickness determined as usual for the caster. At this point the creature continues taking damage from the freezing water\u2014automatically failing any saving throws\u2014plus an additional 3d6 points of cold damage each round until freed from the ice. If an entangled creature steps into the burning geyser, they suffer fire damage as normal and are no longer entangled, as the boiling water melts the ice."

    "living steel (metal and plant, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((metal) package, (plant) package), caster level 5th. As an instantaneous effect, you may as a standard action spend 2 spell points to permanently grant the effects of living steel to a metal creature or object whose size is no larger than the ore that you may recover. Living steel repairs damage to itself at a rate of 2 hit points per day, or 1 hit point per day if it has the broken condition. In addition whenever the wielder of a metal weapon rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll against a creature wearing living steel armor or wielding a living steel shield, the item must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it is instead destroyed. Living steel cannot damage adamantine weapons in this way."

    },
    "natural ally (spirit)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere (Friend To Wildlife (spirit)), caster level 1st. As an instantaneous effect, you may, as a standard action, spend 3 spell points to call a specific fey, magical beast, plant or vermin of a type you designate (provided the creature's CR is equal to or less than 1/2 your caster level) which then appears in a place within range at the start of your next turn, and remains for up to 1 hour per caster level. Unlike Friend To Wildlife, this advanced talent does not require that there are creatures of those types in the area. The creature will aid the caster to the best of its ability, but unless the caster speaks the creature's language, only basic communication is possible (attacking an enemy, defending the caster, etc.) The creature must also be treated fairly and will not give aid that is obviously suicidal. If treated poorly, they may turn on and attack the caster. A caster may not use Natural Ally more than once per day."
    },
    "peace and love (spirit) [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere, Mind sphere. You learn to manipulate the most elusive natural element, the heart. You project a 30-foot aura which penalizes hostile actions. All enemies within this aura take a -1 penalty on any attack rolls they make. You may suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This ability ceases to function if you are stunned, paralyzed, unconscious, dead, or otherwise incapacitated. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. At caster level 10, and every 10 thereafter, the radius of this aura increases by 30 feet. If you spend a spell point as a free action, you may empower this aura to punish those with wicked hearts for 1 round per caster level. While the aura is empowered, whenever a creature taking a penalty from this aura deals damage to you or an ally inside this effect's radius, that creature must make a Will saving throw or take 1d6 nonlethal damage per 4 caster levels (minimum 1d6). A creature can only take damage from this effect once per round; a creature that is immune to nonlethal damage takes lethal damage instead."

    "persistent fog cloud (water, spirit)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((water) package, Deep Nature), caster level 10th. You may spend 2 additional spell points when using the (water) geomancing Fog ability to change the duration of the fog from concentration to permanent. The fog in this form becomes an insubstantial object without hit points. You may concentrate on the fog to have it move up to 1/2 your speed in any direction. If targeted or otherwise in the area of an ability from the Weather sphere, the caster using the Weather sphere must attempt a magic skill check against your magic skill defense. If the Weather sphere user is successful, the fog is immediately dispelled. It is otherwise not subject to the effects of weather not created by magic."

    "phoenix resurgence (fire, spirit)": {

In response to gaining the disabled or dying condition, as an instantaneous effect, you may as an immediate action spend 3 spell points to explode into a ball of flame dealing 1d6 fire damage per caster level to all creatures within 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. At the beginning of your next round, you return to life with 0 hit points and a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level, which remain for 1 hour. You may only use this effect once per hour."
    },
    "rapid growth (plant, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((plant) package, Create Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th. You may spend 3 spell points to create a massive growth of plantlife. This affects up to a 1/2 mile radius area in one of the following ways: Change Terrain:  You may change the terrain in this area to forest or jungle. This does not cause animals native to the forest or jungle to appear, nor does it guarantee that the terrain type will stay that way indefinitely (some areas such as deserts or high mountains cannot support forests or jungles, and a forest or jungle created in these locations may die out over time) but in all other ways, the terrain changes to the selected type. Improve Forest:  If used in an area that already contains a forest or jungle, you may cause the area to grow rapidly. Typical trees become massive trees, all areas become covered in undergrowth, and areas already covered in undergrowth gain heavy undergrowth. A creature standing in the same square as a typical tree gains partial cover, which grants a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves. The presence of a tree does not otherwise affect a creature's fighting space, because it is assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness 5, and 150 hit points. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb a tree. Massive trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hit points. Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them. Space covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees are not mutually exclusive; it is common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth. Increase Yield:  If used in an area of developed farmland, you double the crop production in that area for the rest of the harvest season. This has no effect if used in winter or other times when crops are not being tended."
    },
    "tsunami (water, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((water) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th. As a concentration effect, you spend 2 spell points to create a wave of water 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide per caster level, and 2 feet tall per caster level. This wave moves in a straight line at 60 feet per round over water (30 feet per round over land), and if not combined with Create Water, must originate from a large body of water. It travels perpendicular to its width, and may be maintained for no more than 5 rounds. Creatures struck by the tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage) and are subject to a special CMB check. The wave's CMB is equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave's CMB check. If a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried along by the wave. Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space\u2014if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement or the Freedom word prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature. A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward."
    },
    "volcano (fire, geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((fire) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th. As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to call lava up from deep within the earth. This lava bursts from a 10 feet wide hole in the ground centered within range and creates a spout 10 feet high per 2 caster levels. Any creature in this area or who enters this area takes 10d6 points of fire damage and is hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground, suffering falling damage based upon the height of the volcanic spray (e.g., if the volcano is 80 feet tall, the creature takes 8d6 falling damage) and lands prone in a random square adjacent to the spout. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the fire damage and the creature is not tossed into the air, instead moving to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement. In addition, the volcano sprays lava, smoke, and poison gas in a hemispherical emanation around itself. The radius of this emanation is equal to one half the volcano's height (e.g., an 80 foot spout has a 40-foot radius emanation). All creatures within this area, including yourself, have concealment and suffer 2d6 points of fire damage each round as lava cascades on them. They also suffer 1d6 Constitution damage per round as they inhale poisonous gas (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save), as Vog severity level 7 from the Weather sphere. Even after a creature leaves the lava-filled area, they suffer 1d6 points of damage for 1d3 rounds as the lava already on them cools. A volcano must be created on the ground and cannot be created in other places, such as on the 2nd floor of a building. You can choose to make a smaller volcano than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of lava that's smaller than your maximum."

    "whispering elements (geomancing)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere, caster level 1st. As an instantaneous effect, you may as a standard action spend a spell point to send a message or sound through an element corresponding to a package you possess (air, earth, water, etc.) to a designated spot anywhere in the world. The message travels to the destination, provided that the location is familiar to you and that it can find a way to the location through its chosen medium. The message can travel as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes, though if it cannot reach its destination within 1 hour per caster level, the effect ends without delivering the message. If choosing plant or fire the message can travel without a medium, provided the end location possesses either plantlife or a fire for the message to be delivered through. The message is gentle and unnoticed until it reaches the location, where it then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound to all creatures within 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels of the destination. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. At time of casting, you can prepare the effect to bear a message of no more than 20 + your caster level words, cause the talent to deliver other sounds for 1 round per 2 caster levels, or merely have the message seem to be a faint manifestation of the chosen element. The message cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects."

As an instantaneous effect you may spend 10 minutes and 3 spell points to target a portion of material within close range from one of your packages to create a correlating elemental. For these purposes, the Weather sphere counts as a Nature package. The (plant) package, rather than producing an elemental, instead creates a treant. The creature created is friendly toward you, and while you have no special empathy or connection with it, the creature serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. However, as it is a living, intelligent being, it will expect good treatment in return.

On a failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss, takes fire damage equal to your caster level, and catches fire. The target's insides begin to burn, taking 1d6 fire damage the following round plus 1d6 per round until extinguished. Each round the target may attempt another Fortitude save to extinguish the flames. This is a free action that may be taken once per round. Drinking any non-flammable liquid (such as a potion or water) grants the target a +4 bonus to that round's saving throw. This fire is not extinguished if the target submerges itself; it is internal. If you possess the Nature sphere (fire) package, you may spend an additional spell point to cause the burning damage the target suffers each round to be equal to the largest fire you can create with create fire, if it would be larger. \n Freeze Veins (blood art):  You rapidly freeze the target's blood, making it harder for them to move. On a failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss, takes cold damage equal to your caster level, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. While staggered by this effect, the target becomes unnaturally brittle. Whenever they fall prone, suffer falling damage, or take bludgeoning damage, they take an additional amount of cold damage equal to 1/2 your casting ability modifier. Each round the target may attempt another Fortitude save to warm themselves up. If you possess the Nature sphere (water) package, you may spend an additional spell point to cause the target to be unable to take a 5-foot step while staggered by this effect."

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Nature sphere ((water) package, Water Mastery). Benefit:  You gain resistance to cold equal to 1/2 your MSB (rounded down, this stacks with any other cold resistance you have). If you are immune to cold damage, you may spend a spell point whenever your immunity prevents you from taking cold damage. If you do, you heal a number of hit points equal to the damage you would have taken from the effect if you were not immune, to a maximum of 5 hit points healed per Hit Dice you possess. In addition, you gain the following benefits to the corresponding Nature sphere talents. Sphere effects you create using this feat gain the cold descriptor: Nature's Carapace:  Instead of the Nature's Carapace (water) package effect, you may cloak yourself with a coat of frost. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your caster level plus your casting ability modifier. You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than the current temporary hit points from this sphere effect, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purposes of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. Temporary hit points from this sphere effect regenerate at a rate of 1 per round. You may spend a move action when near a source of water (such as rain, mist, or at least 5 cubic feet of water) within your geomancing range to restore all the temporary hit points from this sphere effect. \n Nature's Movement:  While under the effects of the Nature's Movement (water) package effect, you suffer no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or snowy weather conditions. \n Nature's Weapon:  When using the Nature's Weapon (water) package effect, you may create any weapon you are proficient with instead of creating a dagger. Weapons which use ammunition (e.g. bows, firearms, or slings) are created with basic ammunition ready to be fired by the weapon, and basic ammunition may be summoned and automatically loaded into the weapon as a free action. This ability cannot be used to summon siege weapons or technological items, subject to GM permission. \n Nature Sight:  While under the effects of the Nature Sight (water) package effect, you may treat snow and ice as though it were a body of water, allowing you to detect anything in contact with the same body of snow or ice as you, and may see normally in natural or magical rain, sleet, hail, fog, snowstorms, blizzards, and other similar weather conditions. \n Wreath Of Elements:  Instead of the Wreath Of Elements (water) package effect, you assault a creature with a frozen gale. A target within your reach takes a penalty on their next attack roll, Perception check, or concentration check equal to -2 plus an additional -1 per 5 caster levels (Fortitude negates)."

If you do so, you do not modify attack rolls and damage rolls with your destructive blasts with your Strength modifier, Dexterity modifier, or any other ability score (if you have an ability that allows you to modify attack rolls and/or damage rolls with that ability score). On any individual attacks of which a destructive blast is being applied to a natural or weapon attack (such as with the Energy Strike talent or similar ability), Primal Blast instead modifies the attack and damage rolls of the natural or weapon attack (replacing any other ability modifier bonuses with your casting ability modifier as normal).

Effectively, the attack does not add the ability score and adds your casting modifier as a separate damage bonus. This differs from an unchained rogue's finesse training feature, which replaces Strength with Dexterity and then calculates normally. For example, when using the Destruction sphere Energy Strike talent with a 2 handed weapon, you would only receive your casting ability modifier as bonus damage and not 1.5x your casting ability modifier."

If you possess the Admixture talent, you may pay the additional costs of Admixture as normal to apply multiple damage types to the geomancing effect or alter only half of the damage of the effect (with the other half retaining the original damage type of the geomancing effect). This does not allow you to apply effects besides damage from any effect used in the blast type or admixture (for example, you may not apply the saving throw penalties from Numbing Blast or an alter time ability from Time-Thief's Admixture to a pummel attack). Effects created with this feat operate as they normally would in spite of their altered damage type.

If there are no animals in range, this ability has no effect and you do not receive a response. If you possess the Illusion sphere, you gain the following (glamer): Alpha Presence (glamer):  You may create a glamer that makes animals perceive the target as superior.

This overrides any polymorph effects currently active on the caster. \n \n \n 83 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 84 \n The metallic armor of all creatures within close range of the target or center of the target area sprout spikes, granting them armor spikes or increasing the damage dice of existing armor spikes by one size but also increasing the armor's ACP by 2 and the ASF by 10%. This lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 85 \n The spell point cost of the effect increases by 1d4. If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 86 \n All animals within close range benefit from the Logos talent for 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 87 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 88 \n Roll twice and take both results. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 89 \n The air within close range erupts into flames, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (minimum 1d6) to all targets within the area (Reflex half). \n \n \n 90 \n The effect fails and the action is lost. Spell points or spell slots are not lost. \n \n \n 91 \n The caster loses access to this sphere for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 92 \n All animals within long range must succeed on a Will save or have their attitude become shifted to hostile toward creatures hostile to the caster for 1 minute. \n \n \n 93 \n As an instantaneous effect, any bodies of water within long range raise 2 ft. or double in volume, whichever comes first. Canteens, pots, and other containers overflow as the amount of water in them doubles. The water levels will be restored to their natural level over time by drainage, evaporation, etc. \n \n \n 94 \n A sphere of water envelops a random creature within close range of the caster, forming a vortex around it, which remains for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 95 \n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of his choice from this sphere for 1 round. \n \n \n 96 \n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone as the ground shakes. \n \n \n 97 \n (Combat) The caster is stunned for 1 round. \n \n \n 98 \n As an instantaneous effect, poison ivy grows in a 5-ft. radius + 5 ft. per 5 caster level around the caster. The caster and any creature who enters the area must make a Fortitude save or take -1 penalty (which increases by 1 per 5 caster levels) on all magic skill checks made to concentrate for 1 hour per caster level. This is a poison effect. \n \n \n 99 \n Roll twice and choose the result. Ignore any results that require rerolls. If both rolls thus ignored, there is no effect. \n \n \n 100 \n All allies within close range benefit from the Speak With Animals talent for 1 minute per caster level."

The fire consumes fuel and deals damage as appropriate for its new size, according to Table: Maximum Fire Size. The minimum caster level required to affect a fire is also given in the chart. If two casters are affecting the same fire in the same direction (increasing or decreasing) only the strongest change occurs.

You must spend a spell point to use this ability, and must have a large enough piece of earth (sand or dirt) to pull the ore from. This piece of ore can be brass, bronze, copper, or tin, and the size of the ore recovered depends both on your caster level and the square footage of earth you pull from. The piece of ore you recover is formed on the ground in an unoccupied space within Close range and can be of any basic shape (a ball, a rod, a sheet, even a chair) but cannot be anything complex or with moving parts. You may also pull multiple pieces of ore placed in different adjacent squares, so long as their combined size does not exceed your maximum, and each piece of recovered ore must be of the same type (such as copper or tin). For these purposes, 2 Fine-sized pieces of ore equals 1 Diminutive-sized piece, etc. While this effect is instantaneous and thus cannot be dispelled, ore breaks back into particles after 1 hour per caster level. If a piece of ore is used as a weapon, it counts as an improvised weapon, dealing either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen at the time of recovery.

This allows such a character to make Craft or Profession checks to earn a wage even without the presence of a market or workshop to work in. Rather than earning money, the check instead creates an amount of raw materials equal to that day or week's wage, which may be sold later or used as raw materials for any metal-based crafting.

Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal breathable air in its place. Gaseous creatures gain a Reflex save to avoid being inhaled. This talent can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to utilize the talent in response. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for as long as the talent remains active, but you must hold your breath do do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration (gaseous creatures are immediately and harmlessly exhaled should their gaseous form expire). As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-ft. cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC.

      "benefits": "As an instantaneous effect, spend a spell point as an immediate action to respond to the attack with calculated bursts of wind. If responding to a melee attack, gain a deflection bonus to AC against the attack equal to 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels. If responding to a ranged attack, gain a 10% miss chance against the attack, increasing by 10% per 5 caster levels. In addition, during the round in which this talent is used, you gain moderate fortification (50% chance to negate a critical hit or sneak attack). You must be aware of the attack to use Buffeting Winds."
    },
    "create air (air, geomancing) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to create a cloud of air anywhere within range. This creates one 5-ft. cube per 2 caster levels (minimum: 1 cube) of breathable air. While this is its own geomancing ability, you may combine this effect with another air package geomancing ability as part of the same standard action, in which case the second geomancing ability comes into effect immediately. You must pay any costs associated with both abilities to combine them in this manner. The created cloud of air will immediately displace other gases, liquids, and vapors in the area, but will shortly thereafter behave as normal air. For example, if this talent is used underwater, the created air cloud will form a bubble that will begin to ascend to the surface."

Each round, the target has the remainder of the duration for which it can hold their breath reduced by double the normal amount (a target taking only move, swift, or free actions loses 2 rounds of breath each round, while a target taking standard or full-round actions loses 4 rounds of breath each round). If, during the duration, the target moves out of range or line of effect from you, the effect immediately ends. For the purpose of this talent, a barrier from the Protection sphere breaks line of effect. This talent has no effect on creatures that do not need to breathe air."

      "benefits": "When you use the tremor ability, creatures who are flying up to 10 ft per caster level over the affected area must make a Fly check whose DC is equal to your combat maneuver check or fall to the ground. This fall does not cause falling damage, but does cause them to be affected by the tremor when they land."

You may raise or lower the terrain up to 5 ft + 5 ft per 5 caster levels, and may create variants within the affected area such as summoning a small wall or creating gradients and stair effects. You cannot both raise and lower the terrain with the same use of this ability and cannot create variants in anything smaller than 5 ft squares (i.e., you cannot create 1 ft diameter holes or create a spike of earth). Targets within this area are not damaged by falling if you lower the terrain, and climbing up the edges of lowered terrain usually requires a DC 15 Climb check."

    "granulation (earth, geomancing) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to spontaneously create loose dirt or sand in an area within range. You may reduce the spell point cost by 1 (minimum 0) if you choose to break apart rock and stone already present (reducing their thickness by 1 inch, +1 inch per 5 caster levels), instead of creating the dirt or sand spontaneously. The created sand or dirt is enough to cover a 5 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster levels radius area. While this is its own geomancing ability, you may combine this effect with another earth package geomancing ability as part of the same standard action, in which case the second geomancing ability comes into effect immediately. You must pay any costs associated with both abilities to combine them in this manner. Collapsing Structures with Granulation:  Generally speaking, single castings of Granulation on stone structures will not not be enough to compromise the structural integrity of a building. Should half of the structure's load bearing columns, keystones, or walls be reduced to half thickness or less, a weakened area is created. Those who notice the weakened area (with a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) or Knowledge (engineering) check), may exacerbate the situation by destroying half of the structure's load-bearing objects, triggering a cave-in or collapse. Rules for the cave-in and collapse hazard have been provided in the appendix for your convenience."

      "benefits": "As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points and target a 5-ft space within range filled with sand, dirt or stone, transmuting the top portion into lava. Creatures who touch or otherwise enter the square with lava created with melt earth take 1d6 fire damage per caster level (Reflex half). Even after a creature leaves the lava, the creature continues to take the fire damage (Fortitude save for half damage) for 1d3 rounds. If this effect ends while a creature is inside the space affected by this ability, the earth instantly cools around the creature, immobilizing it (Reflex negates). An immobilized creature cannot move until it makes a successful Strength or Escape Artist check against the caster's Nature DC, both of which require a full-round action. Alternately, another creature may attempt a Strength check as a standard action to break the earth, or any creature may deal 5 damage per caster level to the earth to break it."

    "sandstone (earth, geomancing) (requires dirt or sand) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to transform dirt or sand into stone in an area within range. The size of the created rock or stone depends both on your caster level and the radius of dirt or sand you target. Alternatively, you may encase a dirt or sand covered target in 1 inch thick stone. Refer to Table: Sandstone to determine the maximum target size to be encased. For every size smaller the encased target is than the required radius of dirt or sand, either double the thickness of the stone or increase the number of encased targets. Creatures and objects are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being trapped in stone. On a failure, creatures or objects caught in the area are encased; To escape, they must pass an Escape Artist or Strength check (equal to your bury geomancing DC) as a full-round action; alternatively, a creature may break free by dealing sufficient damage to the rock or stone. Stone has a hardness of 15 and 2 hit points per inch. On a successful save, affected targets are still entangled and immobilized until they escape or 1 minute per caster level, whichever comes first.

Whenever a creature steps onto an affected square, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers damage equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) which overcomes DR/magic. Any target damaged by the spikes has its speed reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it enters a square with a spike. Any creature moving at half speed can pick their way through the spikes without trouble."

While affected, the target is unable to burrow or Earth Glide, but is otherwise unimpeded. You may only target a creature or object whose location you have pinpointed (such as with a successful Perception check or with tremorsense). Unless the target has Earth Glide, the creature cannot be forcefully moved through stone (or lava if the target possesses fire resistance 20+ or fire immunity), but rather only sand or dirt.

    "fire wielder (fire) [core]": {
      "benefits": "When using the create fire geomancing ability, you may encompass the fire around yourself. This accomplishes one of the two following feats: 1. You concentrate the fire around your hands. Rather than affecting an area, this allows you to be treated as armed when making unarmed strikes. In addition, you deal an extra amount of fire damage equal to your maximum create fire size with each unarmed strike. This does not cause targets to catch fire, nor grant you the ability to make extra attacks if you are maintaining the effect through concentration. 2. You place the fire around yourself as a mantle. This does not deal fire damage to yourself, but all adjacent creatures are damaged by your fire and suffer a chance of catching fire, as if they were within the area where the fire was created."

If the object is used as a weapon, it deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. If cast upon an unattended metal object with moving parts (such as a door with hinges), those pieces become non-functional, being partially welded together, requiring a strength check to beat your MSD to break loose and restore functionality.

A fire moved in this way continues to burn, even without fuel (although it may be drowned or extinguished otherwise as normal), and dies as soon as the effect ends if not moved to a new fuel source. If you have spent a spell point to make this ability self-sustaining, you must still focus as a move action to move the fire.

The smoke radiates outward from the fire 5 ft per caster level. Those inside the smoke have concealment from those inside and outside the smoke, those outside the smoke gain concealment, but only against those inside the smoke.

Any creature who enters the designated space or passes through a square adjacent to the target is attacked by the metal object, as if using the magnetize ability. A creature can only be attacked in this way once per turn during their movement, no matter how many times they pass through the affected squares.

Regardless of the creature's size or bodily composition, you recover ore of Fine size upon successfully hitting the target. While the name of this ability suggests the target must bleed or have blood, it is not necessary, the only requirement is that the creature be corporeal and living. Because the constitution damage occurs after the recovery of ore, if the target is immune to ability damage, you still recover ore of Fine size."

The target becomes fused with metal, permanently increasing or decreasing the hardness and AC of the object by 1, +1 per 5 caster levels.

    "aggravating vegetation (plantlife)": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you use the pummel geomancing ability, you may instruct the vegetation to focus on antagonizing its target instead of making a regular attack. The branch or tree makes an attack roll as an antagonize skill check against the target's Psychology DC (14 + 1/2 HD + WIS modifier; or 14 + Sense Motive Bonus, if it is higher). Creatures who are of animal intelligence (1 or 2), or have been previously antagonized gain a +4 bonus to their Psychology DC. Both of these stack. Mindless creatures are immune to the effects of antagonize. Antagonize is a mind-affecting effect. If you successfully beat the target's psychology DC, the creature, instead of taking damage, gains the antagonized condition against the attacking vegetation. The antagonized condition remains for 1 round. The duration of this condition increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat your opponent's Psychology DC. You may not use this ability if you would already deal no damage with your pummel. Antagonized Condition:  The antagonized condition appears in Ultimate Charisma, published and copyrighted by Everyman's Game, LLC. An antagonized creature can only target its antagonist (the one who caused the antagonized condition) with hostile actions. A hostile action is any attack or effect that causes direct harm to an opponent in the form of damage, negative conditions, or any other effect that penalizes or hinders a creature. Furthermore, an antagonized creature does not threaten any opponents except its antagonist: it cannot make attacks of opportunity or be used to determine flanking bonuses against other opponents. A creature is no longer antagonized if its antagonist is helpless, unconscious, or cannot participate in combat. If an antagonizes creature uses an ability that targets multiple creatures, the antagonist must be chosen among these targets. If an antagonized creature uses an ability that targets an area, its antagonist must be within the ability's targeted area. On each round after the first, an antagonized creature may attempt a Sense Motive skill check as a swift action to realize the folly of its actions. This skill check is opposed by the antagonist's original antagonize skill check. If the creature succeeds on its Sense Motive skill check, the antagonized condition ends, but the creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty to the saving throw DC of its abilities and any spells it casts for 1 minute. These penalties do not apply against the antagonist. Attacking Vegetation Under the Effect of Pummel Players and Game Masters alike may require the armor class, hardness, and hit point values of the branches or trees affected by pummel. While particular species of vegetation may cause for variance in these values, the table below are some that are suggested which may be used should such a situation arise. Branches and trees under the effect of pummel are still objects and thus always fail saving throws. Branches as objects gain the broken condition if they lose over 50% of their hit points, and are destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. Trees animated through the enhancement sphere should not use these statistics, but rather those provided for animated objects. Size \n Example \n Armor Class \n Hardness \n Hit Points \n \n \n Medium \n Secondary Branch or Sapling \n 7 \n 5 \n 5 \n \n \n Large \n Primary Branch or Young Tree \n 6 \n 5 \n 15 \n \n \n Huge \n Juvenile Tree \n 5 \n 5 \n 50 \n \n \n Gargantuan \n Typical Adult Tree \n 4 \n 5 \n 150 \n \n \n Colossal \n Massive Tree \n 3 \n 5 \n 500 Number of Branches Per Size Category of Tree Tree Size \n Number of Medium Branches \n Number of Large Branches \n Number of Huge Branches \n \n \n Huge \n 1d4 (avg 3) \n - \n - \n \n \n Gargantuan \n 3d4 (avg 8) \n 1d4 (avg 3) \n - \n \n \n Colossal \n 9d4 (avg 23) \n 3d4 (avg 8) \n 1d4 (avg 3) Because trees are objects, it is recommended that destroying a branch also reduces the overall health of each larger branch and tree by an equal amount. For example, if a juvenile tree has 4 medium branches, then destroying all four would reduce the tree's hit points by 20, leaving it with 30 hp remaining. In the case of a massive tree, destroying 1 medium branch would reduce 1 large branch, 1 huge branch and the colossal tree's hit points by 5."

    "barkskin (plantlife, spirit)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point as a standard action to grow plantlife all over your body for 1 minute per caster level. This grants you a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor, + 1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, in natural environments you gain a circumstance bonus to Stealth equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1).

      "benefits": "As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to instantaneously grow plants in an area within range. This may create one tree (to a maximum size equal to that which you can control through the pummel geomancing ability) or a field of plants within a 5 ft radius + 5 ft per 5 caster levels area. This may create basic plants (corn, underbrush, ivy) but cannot create plants with inherent qualities (i.e., you cannot create rare herbs, etc.). While this is its own geomancing ability, you may combine this effect with another plant package geomancing ability as part of the same standard action, in which case the second geomancing ability comes into effect immediately.

    "nauseating fog (plantlife, water)": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you use the water geomancing fog ability, you may spend an additional spell point to cause the cloud to become nauseating, in addition to its other effects. Each creature in the area of the fog must make a Fortitude save or gain the nauseated condition, making them unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action a nauseated creature can take is a single move action per turn. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for a single round after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn."

      "benefits": "When using the pummel geomancing ability, the tree branches may throw vegetation as a ranged attack instead of only making melee slam attacks. The attack is treated as a thrown weapon with a range increment equal to twice the tree branch's reach. The attack roll and damage otherwise remain unchanged."

If you would deal damage with pummel, you may forfeit dealing damage to instead have those hit by the attack become coated with sap which grants the fatigued condition until they remove it as a full-round action. If a fatigued creature becomes coated with sap, they then acquire the exhausted condition until they remove it with a full-round action. You may not combine this ability with any other ability that causes your pummel to deal no damage."

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to gain the ability to speak with plants for 1 minute per caster level. You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures and can ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal, and a plant may be stupid, cunning, or cruel as any other creature. If a plant creature is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you."

    "spores (plantlife)": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you instruct the trees to attack with the pummel geomancing ability, you may choose to have the tree's branches release spore pods instead of making an attack. This targets a 5 ft burst within their attack range, causing all creatures within that area to make a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d6 rounds. If a creature fails its Fortitude save against this effect while already sickened, it becomes nauseated for 1 round. The tree and the caster are both unaffected by these spores. You cannot combine this ability with another ability that causes your pummel to deal no damage."

This is the same as the entangle geomancing ability, except instead of making creatures entangled and unable to move, this effect deals piercing and slashing damage to them. Targets inside the area or who enter the area suffer 1 d6 damage +1 per 2 caster levels (Reflex half). Creatures who remain in the area suffer damage once per round at the end of your subsequent turns. This does not stack with any thorns already on the plants used in the effect. You may place an entangle and thorns effect on the same space."

      "benefits": "When creating an entangle or thorns effect, the effect grows tall enough to affect flying creatures as well. Creatures up to 10 ft per caster level over your entangle or thorns effects must pass a Reflex save or affected as normal. If they pass this Reflex save, they must still pass a Fly check (DC 15 + caster level) or be forced to fly at half speed while over the area. When affected by an entangle effect, flying creatures are pulled to the ground by the plants and become unable to move. Flying creatures grabbed by an entangle effect become prone, but do not take falling damage. Spirit Talents"

    "absorbing inhalation (air, spirit) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "As a concentration effect, you may as a standard action grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar cloud-like effect during the duration of the talent. The cloud-like effect can have no larger of a radius than 10 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster levels. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a magic skill check to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal breathable air in its place. Gaseous creatures gain a Reflex save to avoid being inhaled. This talent can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to utilize the talent in response. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for as long as the talent remains active, but you must hold your breath do do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration (gaseous creatures are immediately and harmlessly exhaled should their gaseous form expire). As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-ft. cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud immediately ends the duration of this talent. If you do not exhale the cloud before this talent's duration expires, you suffer the cloud's effects, automatically fail any saving throw made to resist it, and exhaling any gaseous creatures inhaled."

    "animal friend (spirit) [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point as a standard action to cause animals to treat you as a friend for 1 minute per caster level. Indifferent animals (such as domesticated animals) become Friendly to you, while Unfriendly animals (such as wild animals) become Indifferent to you. This means that wild animals will not attack unless provoked, and you may make requests of animals, provided you may communicate with them (if you cannot communicate with a creature, only basic commands such as 'go', 'come', 'fight', or 'stay' may be communicated). This has no effect on animals who are hostile to you (such as those already in combat), and an animal with a master (such as an animal companion) will still attack if commanded to by its master. Once during the duration of this ability, you may call the nearest animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within this effect's duration, you are aware of this fact."

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to gain the ability to speak with vermin for 1 minute per caster level. This is accomplished less through speech, but more by pheromone exchange. Because information transmitted and received is limited, vermin will likely be unable to give (or receive) detailed responses or questions. Using this talent doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. If a vermin is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you."

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to speak with water for 1 minute per caster level. This is not truly accomplished through speech, but rather by dipping a limb into the water you may learn what else has touched it, passed by it, what is hidden underneath it, etc. You can tell depth, weight, size, and number of passers by, but not more detailed information (the names or conversations of passers by, for instance). Because water is constantly moving, you can only receive information on things that have occurred less than 1 day per caster level ago. You can speak with both fresh or salt bodies of water. If attempting to converse with particularly large bodies of water, such as oceans, you can only aquire information from a portion of the body of water, to a maximum distance of 1000 ft +100 ft per caster level."

Water and all other liquid becomes solid to you, allowing you to move over it as if it were normal ground. Especially turbulent water (such as during a storm) may count as difficult terrain. You may always choose to sink into the water and swim if you so desire, in which case you are considered to have a Swim speed equal to your land speed, granting you all the usual benefits of a Swim speed, including a racial +8 bonus to Swim checks.

This may be done multiple times, but the length cannot become smaller than 5 ft. A target cannot be pushed back further than the wave's length. All creatures within the affected area are pushed as if by a Bull Rush combat maneuver, except it does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Ward As a standard action, you may create a ward centered on yourself with a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per caster level, but can also be made so small as to only cover yourself. Wards remain as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow them to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration. Wards remain in the location they were created, even if you move (however, if the ward is created entirely on top of a vehicle, it will move with that vehicle).

    },
    "barrier": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that creates a mostly-transparent wall of force at its perimeter. While this barrier does not block line of sight, it does block line of effect; thus, while you could still target a creature through the barrier (such as for an attack that attempts to break the barrier and still deal damage to the creature on the other side), the barrier does stop attacks, movement, breath weapons, and any spells or sphere effects that rely on line of effect until the barrier is destroyed. Ethereal creatures are technically stopped by the barrier, but can usually find a way around it (as the barrier does not cut through objects, and so usually stops at ground level). Creatures inside a space where a barrier is created are shunted to the nearest empty space on the outside. A barrier has hit points equal to twice your caster level and a Break DC of 15 + 1/2 your caster level. A barrier can hold weight, up to 2,400 lbs. + 250 lbs. per caster level; beyond that, a barrier simply shatters as if broken with a Strength check. If a barrier is broken anywhere, the entire effect ends. If an attack is directed at a target through the barrier, the attack first deals its damage to the barrier itself. If this damage is enough to destroy the barrier, the attack continues on to its intended target, although damage dealt to the barrier is subtracted from any damage done to the target or targets. Burst-effect attacks such as splash weapons, fireball spells, or others attempting to travel through the barrier explode at the barrier's edge and also must overcome the barrier's hit points to damage targets on the other side. If you maintain your barrier through concentration, its hit points are renewed each round on your turn.

In addition, when you spend a spell point to maintain a barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make it self-repairing. The barrier regains 1 hit point + 1 hit point per 2 caster levels at the start of each of your turns. A barrier that has been reduced to 0 hit points has been destroyed and cannot regain hit points or be restored using this talent. If used on a barrier comprised of cubes using the Shaped Ward talent, this talent allows each cube to regain 1 lost hit point or for 1 cube to regain all lost hit points when you spend a move action or a spell point and a swift action to use this ability. When you spend a spell point to maintain the barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make each cube regain 1 hit point per round.

If creating the ward would cause it to go through another object, the ward cuts harmlessly through the material and affecting targets on the far side (without compromising the integrity of the object, but preventing the object from being moved in the case of a barrier). If creating the ward would cause a physical manifestation such as a barrier to go through a creature or animated object, the ward shunts the creature just outside the effect of the sphere. These modifications to your wards make it so that ethereal creatures, or creatures with unusual movement modes such as burrow cannot pass through a barrier by going around the ward, but must instead destroy the barrier to enter or exit.

    "glyph": {
      "benefits": "At the time of casting a ward you may choose to shape the ward into a glyph: a magical trap whose effects are not immediately active until triggered. A glyph is cast upon a 5-foot-by- 5-foot area and takes the form of a 6 inch tall symbol, faintly visible on a surface. The glyph lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until activated by a trigger specified by the caster at the time it is created. When activated, the glyph becomes the center point for the ward, and it performs its function for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, and then the ability ends. Once cast, the glyph cannot be moved from its location, unless its complete surface is movable (for example, if cast on the deck of a ship). Destroying the surface the glyph is on destroys it, but does not end the glyph effect once it has been triggered. If you have the Permanent Ward advanced talent, you may make a glyph that is permanent, and will activate with its trigger, stay active for as long as the trigger is active, and shut off afterwards until triggered again. Creating a glyph requires a round per caster level and a spell point. You must also pay the spell point cost of whatever ward the glyph will create, though you do not need to spend a spell point to maintain the ward: the glyph can maintain the ward as if it were concentrating. When you create the glyph, you may decide what area is covered by the glyph's effect; this may be up to close range from the location of the glyph. You set all of the conditions of the glyph when it is created. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when creating the glyph) triggers the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to chaos, evil, good, or law, or to pass those of a particular religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if, for example, a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded. A glyph knows when it has been read, which may be used as part of a trigger. A glyph can only have one trigger, but you can always trigger your own glyph as a free action, provided you are still on the same plane of existence. A glyph can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and can also be detected as a magical trap can be. In order for someone to spot one of your glyphs it requires a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Disabling the glyph requires a Disable Device check with the same DC. Alternatively, destroying the surface the glyph is imprinted on can destroy the glyph, but once activated, destroying the glyph does not dispel the effect, and the glyph activates when damaged if the damage is not sufficient to destroy it."

This flat plane may be arranged vertically, horizontally, or along whatever angle you choose. In addition, when creating a barrier, you may spend an additional spell point to increase its Hit Points to 10 per caster level, double its maximum weight, and increase the Break DC by 10.

If you maintain your barrier through concentration, you may change the effect as part of the action used to concentrate: Forceful Rebuke:  You may attempt a bull-rush attempt against all enemies within 5 feet of your barrier, using your caster level + your casting ability modifier in place of your CMB.

Fortifying Surge:  All allies within 10 feet of your barrier gain DR/- equal to half your caster level for 1 round."

    "selective barrier": {
      "benefits": "When you create a barrier, you may spend a spell point to make its structure more complicated, allowing certain kinds of activities to pass through the barrier. For each of the following, you must choose whether it can cross the barrier, and if so, in what direction: melee attacks, ranged attacks, area of effect abilities, and movement. Whenever the barrier regains or could regain hit points, you may change this decision."
    },
    "shaped ward [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "When you create a ward, you may alter its shape so that it takes the form of a close-range cone or a medium-range line, each emanating from yourself (or from within a location where you could center a ward if you possess the Distant Protection talent). If you spend 1 additional spell point, you may shape the ward in any area you desire out of contiguous 5-foot cubes, up to a maximum of 2 cubes per caster level. When using this talent in conjunction with a barrier, each cube is a separate object that completely fills a 5-foot square, and has 5 hit points, or 4 + your caster level hit points if you possess the Greater Barrier talent. Like a barrier, the cubes are mostly-transparent, and they block the same modes of attack. They are otherwise materially identical to a barrier, and have the same Break DC. Objects and creatures can not be trapped within a cube, and the presence of a creature in a square prevents the barrier cube from forming there. Barrier cubes must be created at ground level, but can be stacked on top of each other and used to form arches, stairs, or other shapes. All cubes must be created within an area you could cover with a ward. This talent replaces Barrier Maze."
    },
    "shared aegis": {
      "benefits": "In addition to providing an aura of protection, any aegis you create can be extended beyond the body of the creature bearing it. When a creature under the effects of an aegis you created has an allied creature within its natural reach, the ally also gains the benefit of the aegis. This requires active effort from the creature wearing the aegis, and they can not use their aegis to defend another creature if they would be denied their Dexterity bonus against the source of the effect they are protecting their ally from. While a creature is under the protection of your shared aegis this way, you may use (succor) talents that target them as if they were bearing the aegis. Only one creature may benefit from a succor this way."
    },
    "status": {
      "benefits": "You always know the direction and distance to all creatures benefiting from your aegises and are aware of any conditions affecting them (confused, disabled, diseased, dying, nauseated, panicked, poisoned, staggered, stunned, unconscious, unharmed, wounded, etc.). If the target dies or moves to another plane of existence, this effect ceases to function. Aegis/Ward Talents"
    },
    "ablating (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that has a chance of negating attacks against the protected creature. When created, the aegis has an ablation rate of 20% + 5% for every 3 caster levels, maximum 50%. The aegis acts as a miss chance equal to its ablation rate against attacks, and whenever the protected creature is missed due to miss chance, its ablation rate drops by 5%. When the ablation rate becomes equal to or less than 0, the aegis ends, even if the duration has not yet expired. If the character has a miss chance from another source, only the highest miss chance applies, and the aegis is only reduced if its ablation rate is higher than all other miss chances."
    },
    "armored magic (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that wraps the target in protective barriers, granting them either a +3 armor bonus or a +1 shield bonus to AC (your choice). This does not stack with other armor or shield bonuses, but does apply against attacks made by incorporeal creatures. These bonuses increase by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess."
    },
    "breathless (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that suspends the body's needs. The target gains a +4 morale bonus to saving throws against poisons and diseases, can withstand extreme pressures (such as from the ocean), and can survive without air, making it immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled poison), and granting it the power to survive underwater, or even in a vacuum. This does not give immunity to cloud or gas attacks that do not require breathing."
    },
    "clarity (ward)": {
      "benefits": "Within the area of this ward, attempts to conceal, obfuscate, or disguise oneself are hindered. Any creature within the ward must succeed at a Will save or they become unable to use any abilities to disguise or conceal themselves. Likewise, any spell, spell-like ability, or sphere ability that creates illusions or makes it difficult to sense physical phenomena is more difficult to use. When the ward is first created, the user attempts a single magical skill check against every illusion or concealing effect created with a spell, spell-like ability, or sphere ability. Magic items have a MSD of 11 + their caster level and creatures using spell-like abilities have an MSD equal to 11 + their Hit Dice. If your check succeeds, the effect is suppressed or the magic item ceases to function, respectively. Time spent suppressed counts toward a magical effect's total duration. Any additional attempt to create an illusion or concealment effect requires the caster to beat your MSD with a magical skill check. They must do this even if they passed their Will saving throw."
    },
    "deathless (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that blocks direct attacks on one's life. This grants the subject a +4 morale bonus to saving throws against all death spells, Death sphere abilities, channeled negative energy, and other magical death effects, as well as harmful effects originating from healing spells, Life sphere abilities, channeled positive energy, and other magical healing effects. The subject is granted a Will save to negate these effects even if one is not normally allowed. Author's Note:  The Deathless aegis only grants a save to negate one of the listed effects if no save was already offered by that effect. This Will save is at the ability's normal DC, and if one is unlisted, the GM should determine what the DC of that ability is (usually 10+1/2 the source's Hit Dice+a relevant ability score modifier)."
    },
    "destructionless (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that protects against direct magical attacks. This grants a +4 morale bonus to AC and saving throws against ray attacks, effects from the evocation magic school or the Destruction sphere, breath weapons, as well as attacks and effects originating from elementals."
    },
    "energy resistance (aegis, ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that suppresses one energy type of your choice (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Any damage of that energy type dealt within this area is reduced by 10 + your caster level. You may also create an aegis that grants energy resistance 10 + your caster level to either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. These effects only absorb damage and may not protect from other side effects of an attack."
    },
    "exclusion (ward)": {
      "benefits": "You can create a ward that prevents entry of a common material or element chosen when you create the ward. You may choose an element based on their physical material (such as stone, metal, water, or acid), form of energy (such as fire or light) or based on their physical properties (such as poisonous materials or living materials). Magical and non-magical materials excluded have great difficulty entering the ward, but are unaffected once inside. Creatures made of or carrying the material with them must succeed at a Strength check against a DC equal to your Protection sphere DC to cross the threshold of the ward, or they can simply drop any of the warded material they are carrying. An attack from outside the ward that crosses into the ward and is composed of the offending material receives a penalty to attack equal to your caster level."
    },
    "eyeless (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that protects against effects dependent on light, dark, or that attack the senses. This grants a +4 morale bonus to AC and saving throws against effects from the Light and Dark spheres, attacks based on light or from illusionary sources (although this does not grant a bonus to saving throws made to disbelieve illusions), as well as gaze attacks and attacks and effects with the shadow descriptor."
    },
    "fateless (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that protects against tugs on the strands of fate. This grants a +4 morale bonus to saving throws against effects from the divination magic school, effects from the Divination and Fate spheres, and effects with the curse descriptor. This also applies to all spells, spell-like, and supernatural abilities originating from hags and outsiders. The subject is granted a Will save to negate curse effects even if one is not normally allowed."
    },
    "friendship (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that gives a creature special protection from the spell, spell-like, sphere and supernatural abilities of his allies. Whenever one of that creature's allies uses a spell, spell-like, or sphere ability that is subject to spell resistance and covers an area, or a supernatural ability that covers an area, allies with this aegis and their equipment are treated as if they were immune. This aegis does not block beneficial effects from a creature's allies."
    },
    "guardian (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that draws harmful attention to its bearer and away from their allies. Any hostile target within 10 feet of the bearer of this aegis who decides to target any creature other than the bearer of this aegis suffers a -1 penalty to their attack roll. This penalty increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels possessed. Multiple Guardian aegises do not stack; if a creature attacks one creature with this aegis while within the area of another creature with this aegis, they suffer no penalty for their attack."
    },
    "impartiality (aegis, ward)": {
      "benefits": "Creatures within this ward or bearing this aegis are treated as having no alignment for all magical effects. Effects that detect alignment (such as the Divine Alignment alternate divination from the Divination sphere) do not detect the creature or creatures protected, while those that affect certain alignments have no effect on protected creatures at all. This does not allow a creature to disguise their alignment - they appear as an absence of alignment."
    },
    "impedance (aegis, ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that makes it difficult for creatures to approach the center of the ward. At the beginning of their turn, or when they try to enter the ward, a creature must succeed at a Will save or they are unable to enter or move any closer to the center of the ward. If applied as an aegis, this functions the same except the range is reduced to 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels. This talent does not interfere with attacks; only movement."
    },
    "inner peace (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that grants the target a +4 morale bonus to saving throws against all fear, emotional and mind-affecting abilities, both magical or mundane. When the target is affected by a magical ability this bonus applies to, they are always granted a save to completely negate the effect, even if one is not normally allowed. The improved composure of the subject also grants them a +4 morale bonus to Bluff checks to conceal emotions or relay secret messages, and to Diplomacy checks to influence attitudes to make creatures calm."
    },
    "iron shield (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that protects against the forces of nature. This grants a +4 bonus to AC and saving throws against all forms of environmental damage (though not from vacuum), attacks that utilize nature as a resource (such as lightning called from the sky, but not from all electricity attacks), abilities of the Nature and Weather spheres, and the spell, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of fey creatures, magical beasts, and plant creatures."
    },
    "logic (ward)": {
      "benefits": "This ward presents subtle inconsistencies and misdirections that prevent entry. Creatures must have an Intelligence of at least 3 to enter into the warded area. Teleportation bypasses the effect of this ward, and low-intelligence creatures can still be pushed or otherwise motivated into the ward area by other more intelligent creatures or by accident."
    },
    "magnetic shield (ward)": {
      "benefits": "Creatures within this ward have damage reduction equal to your caster level against all metal weapons or metal tipped weapons, with the exception of silver weapons. This defense also applies to melee attacks by ironshod creatures or creatures that have metal covering the point of contact of the attack (such as a punch from someone wearing a gauntlet)."
    },
    "mettle (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "A creature with this aegis receives an untyped bonus to their AC equal to 5 + your caster level against critical hit confirmation rolls."
    },
    "missile shield (ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that protects creatures within from projectiles, including projectile weapons, thrown rocks, rays made up of projectiles (such as created by the Stone Blast talent of the Destruction sphere) or falling debris. Any damage of that type dealt within this area is reduced by 5 + your caster level. These effects only absorb damage and may not protect from other side effects of an attack (like being pinned under the weight of a thrown boulder or being poisoned by a poisoned arrow)."
    },
    "mystic shell (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that protects magical effects on the character. A mystic shell has 2 layers, + 1 layer per 10 caster levels. While the layers are in place, whenever a magical effect on the character would be dispelled, it remains and instead a layer of the shell is lost. Each layer is counterspelled as a separate magical effect. Layers of the shell can also be sacrificed to use (succor) talents or abilities. Layers from multiple castings of this aegis do not stack."
    },
    "obscurity (aegis, ward)": {
      "benefits": "Creatures with this aegis or within this ward appear unremarkable and unimportant to those around them. Creatures must succeed at a Will save to be able to notice their presence, even if they succeeded on a relevant Perception check. A successful save allows them to see the obscured creatures normally (assuming they can see the creatures normally), until they have left the sight of the creature by either moving out of line-of-sight or succeeding at a Stealth check. Creatures who are specifically looking for the protected creatures and are aware of their identity (like those who have been told you are there by someone else), or who are engaged in combat with them automatically pass this saving throw. Creatures with this aegis do not leave behind tracks or other signs of their passage."
    },
    "obstruction (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that absorbs damage. The target gains DR/- equal to 1/2 the caster level (minimum 1). Once this aegis has absorbed damage equal to 10 x the caster level, the aegis ends even if its duration has not yet expired."
    },
    "painful aegis (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that inflicts pain on creatures that hurt its bearer. Whenever a creature successfully hits the bearer of this aegis with a melee or ranged attack, that creature suffers 1 point of nonlethal damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1)."
    },
    "peacebound (aegis, ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that renders all creatures within incapable of causing violence. Any violent action or targeted offensive magical effect created within the ward fails and the target's action is wasted (Will negates). If any target succeeds at this Will save, the ward's effect immediately ends for all. When a Peacebound ward is broken in this fashion, all creatures within become immune to that caster's Peacebound ward for 24 hours. You may also create an aegis that makes the target immune to violent actions or magic. Any such action made against the target requires the attacker to succeed at a Will save or lose that action. If a creature succeeds at this Will save they are immune to the effects of that casting of this aegis. If the bearer of the Peacebound aegis takes an offensive action against any creature, the aegis immediately ends."
    },
    "plexing aegis (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "A Plexing aegis offers no specific protection until activated, but at any time during its duration you may spend an immediate action to activate it, turning it into any aegis you can create. When this occurs, you must pay the spell point cost of the new aegis normally. You may activate Plexing aegises on multiple creatures with the same action, provided all of them are being turned into the same kind of aegis. Once activated, the Plexing aegis remains that aegis type for the remainder of its duration. The caster level of a Plexing aegis is determined when it is cast and does not change once activated. A Plexing aegis costs a spell point to create like any other aegis, and may be sacrificed to use a succor ability before or after it is activated. You may combine this talent with the Mass Aegis talent at the time of its casting or to activate multiple Plexing aegises at once, but must pay the cost of Mass Aegis for each of these uses."
    },
    "quantum lock (ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that represses all effects that alter reality, including sphere abilities that change the rate of time, teleportation, gravitational effects, transdimensional effects, distortion of space, and Warp and Time sphere abilities within its area of effect. When this ward is created, attempt one magic skill check against each effect in the area of the ward that it can repress. Magic items have a MSD of 11 + their caster level. If your check exceeds the MSD of the magical effect or item, the effect is suppressed or the magic item ceases to function, respectively. Time spent suppressed counts toward a magical effect's total duration. Once inside the effect, any caster attempting to use an ability that can be repressed by this ward must attempt a magic skill check against your MSD. If they fail, the ability is negated completely (e.g., the creature never leaves its point of origin)."
    },
    "ray deflection (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "Whenever a ray attack is used against a creature with this aegis, there is a 20% chance the ray will be deflected back at the caster. This increases by 5% for every 5 caster levels to a maximum of 50%. This aegis does not offer protection against rays that automatically hit, such as those with a natural 20 on the attack roll. A deflected ray makes an attack against the attacker using the same attack roll and all of the applicable modifiers of the original attack and if it hits, the attacker takes the attack's damage and suffers all the other consequences of getting struck with that attack."
    },
    "repel chaos/evil/good/law (ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that repels creatures of one end of the alignment spectrum (chaotic, evil, good, lawful), chosen by you when this ward is created. All creatures of that alignment cannot cross the edge of this ward unless they succeed at a Will save. Once a creature has succeeded at this Will save, they may cross the barrier without trouble and are immune to your Repel ward for 24 hours. If a creature is already within this warded area when it is created, or if the ward is moved into their space, they instantly become immune to the ward, as if they had succeeded at their saving throw. You cannot repel an alignment that you yourself possess."
    },
    "resist transformation (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that holds the target's shape together. This grants the subject a +4 morale bonus on saves against polymorph effects, Enhancement and Alteration sphere effects, effects from the alter ability from the Creation sphere, and spells from the transmutation school, as well as to saving throws against spell, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of lycanthropes and creatures with the shapeshifter subtype."

      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that grants +1 resistance bonus to all saving throws. This increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels you possess."
    },
    "slippery (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that protects a creature from being physically restrained or manipulated. The bearer of this aegis gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Acrobatics checks, Escape Artist checks, and to CMD, and if they are under an effect they could escape with an Escape Artist check they may attempt such a check immediately as an immediate action. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess."
    },
    "spell ward (aegis, ward)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create a ward that represses all magic within its area of effect. Attempt one magic skill check against each magical effect, magic item, or summoned creature within the area. Magic items have a MSD of 10 + their caster level. If your check exceeds the MSD of the magical effect, item, or caster who summoned the creature, the effect is suppressed, the magic item ceases to function, or the summoned creature temporarily disappears. Time spent suppressed counts toward a magical effect's total duration. Any caster attempting to use a magical ability in or targeted within this area, or any summoned creature attempting to enter this area, must attempt a magic skill check against your MSD. On a success, the magical effect is unimpeded, and the summoned creature is not banished by that Spell Ward. This counts as an antimagic field for effects that interact with them. You may also spend 2 spell points instead of 1 to create an aegis that grants the target spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level."
    },
    "stabilize (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that stabilizes the target against planar effects or effects that warp time and space. The target gains a +4 morale bonus to AC and saving throws against any teleportation effects, effects from the Time or Warp spheres, direct telekinesis (such as Hostile Lift, but not attacks from Bludgeons) as well as any other effects that alter time, such as the slow spell. This also applies to attacks and abilities from extraplanar creatures, such as summoned or conjured creatures. Succor Talents"

      "benefits": "As an immediate action, you may dismiss an aegis on an ally to give them energy resistance to all types of energy damage equal to your caster level until the beginning of your next turn. If the target already possesses energy resistance of a certain type, it instead increases by your caster level."

When creating a Spell Ward, you may spend an additional spell point to improve the ward's abilities: The ward stops all magic and summoned creatures without the need for a magic skill check. If this ward is pitted against a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must still attempt a magic skill check against the creature's spell resistance to banish it."

    "complex glyph": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Protection sphere (Glyph), caster level 5th. When you create a glyph, you may substitute an ability that you possess from another sphere in place of a ward. This ability must either target an area, or must have the ability to attack creatures. When triggered, the glyph activates the ability. For an ability with a duration, it lasts for 1 round per caster level (even if the original duration of the ability was longer), while an instantaneous ability activates once against whomever triggered the glyph, or a random target within range if that is not applicable. You must pay the full spell point cost of the sphere ability the glyph contains. You do not need to pay a spell point to maintain an effect without concentration - the glyph maintains the effect as if it were concentrated on. A glyph cannot discern automatically between allies and enemies; only those who trigger them and those who have not. This extends to the substitute effects which normally would be able to distinguish between allies and enemies. If you possess the Cantrips feat, you may use any simple magical effect the Cantrips feat can create (such as a simple alarm, or having an illusionary mouth appear and deliver a short message) with the glyph instead of a sphere ability. Counterspell may also be substituted for a sphere ability. Similarly, you may add a non-magical trap (such as those constructed with the Craft skill) to a glyph in place of a sphere ability. A complex glyph uses your caster level with the sphere of the sphere ability to determine the effect of the sphere ability, but uses your Protection caster level to determine its own properties."

    "permanent ward": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Protection sphere (Enduring Protection), caster level 10th. When creating a ward, you may spend 2 spell points to increase its duration to permanent. A complex glyph can be made permanent as a normal glyph can, except for those complex glyphs that trigger non-magical traps. When a permanent glyph is triggered, it uses its ward or sphere ability. For abilities with a duration, the glyph activates the ability and then maintains it as if it were concentrating on it for as long as the trigger is satisfied. For an attack ability, the glyph attacks a randomly selected creature in range of both the ability and the glyph itself once per round until there are no longer any targets to attack. The glyph always has an initiative equal to its caster level and does not roll a d20 or add any modifiers to its initiative. To be turned into a permanent glyph, a ward or other sphere ability must be usable as a full-round action or shorter without costing any spell points to use. If the caster has abilities that allows them to reduce spell point cost by increasing casting time, they may apply them, provided the casting time stays at a fullround action or less."

You may create a ward that protects against and grants immunity to harmful environmental effects, such as extreme temperatures, toxicity, and lack of air. This includes immunity and protection against planar traits (such as alignment, energy, magic, and time traits) which would harm or weaken a creature inside its radius, but does not negate any benefits of the planar trait. This does not protect against environmental effects not native to the plane and not caused by a planar trait, such as magical weather created with the Weather sphere. If you possess the Breathless (aegis) talent, when you grant an aegis with the Breathless (aegis) talent, the granted aegis also provides this talent's immunities and protections against environmental and planar traits."

    "subtle (aegis)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Protection sphere, caster level 5th. A creature with this aegis is surrounded by a field of magical energy that interferes with other forms of magic. Rather than producing an obvious spell resistance effect, however, the creature with the aegis becomes hidden from sphere abilities and supernatural abilities. The effect is such that these abilities can not target the character properly without assistance from a creature. If a supernatural or sphere ability discerns between allies and enemies (as many totems of the War sphere do), or acts in a way that its effects only affect certain creatures (such as creatures of a creature type or a specific alignment), the creature with the aegis is unaffected or considered to be an ally. Similarly, magic traps and contingency effects (like glyphs) are not triggered by the creature's presence, and any effect relying on a magical trigger is also not triggered, as if the creature were invisible to the trap or effect. Traps may still be sprung by physical triggers, however. Abilities that rely on the caster choosing targets are not affected by this aegis, even if that ability only works on certain targets (such as a paladin's smite evil ability), and this does not give the bearer any special concealment from creatures using magical senses. Area effect abilities are also still effective against the creature, provided the effect affects every creature, or affects every creature save for those specifically made invulnerable by the caster."

Against that creature, the aegis or ward acts as if it had a +10 circumstance bonus to caster level, but it is ineffective against any other creature. This means the aegis or ward works against attacks made by the creature, their abilities, or the attacks or abilities of other creatures it summons or controls. To be used, the caster must be able to uniquely identify the creature. If the caster has met the target, this is sufficient, otherwise they require some other means of identifying the creature. Having a sample of the creature's blood or tissue works, or having the creature's true name, but a description of the creature is not sufficient. The GM is the ultimate adjudicator of what is required."

If you possess the Protection sphere Status talent, you may attempt skill checks to learn additional information about a target or its surroundings while they benefit from one of your aegis effects, but must spend the normal action required to attempt such a check.

    "barrier [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that creates a mostly-transparent wall at its perimeter, stopping attacks, movement, breath weapons, and any spells or sphere effects that must travel to their destination (such as destructive blasts, ghost strikes, or spells that require ranged touch attacks). The Abjurer's Handbook \n$4.99 Other spells or sphere effects, however, such as teleportation effects, mind-altering magic, and gaze attacks may all bypass this ward. Ethereal creatures are technically stopped by the barrier, but can usually find a way around it (as the barrier does not cut through objects, and so usually stops at ground level). A barrier has hit points equal to 4 + your caster level and a Break DC of 15 + 1/2 your caster level. If an attack is directed at a target through the barrier, the attack first deals its damage to the barrier itself. If this damage is enough to destroy the barrier, the attack continues on to its intended target, although damage dealt to the barrier is subtracted from any damage done to the target or targets. Burst-effect attacks such as splash weapons, fireball spells, or others attempting to travel through the barrier explode at the barrier's edge and also must overcome the barrier's hp to damage targets on the other side. If you maintain your barrier through concentration, its HP is renewed each round on your turn. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, barriers created with the Protection sphere are transparent force effects and block line of effect, but do not block line of sight or teleportation. Barriers can grant cover, but not concealment (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Aegis [Core] As a standard action, you may touch a creature and spend a spell point, granting them an aegis for 1 hour per caster level. Unwilling targets are allowed a Will save to resist gaining an aegis. Multiple aegises of the same talent can be placed on a single creature, and the creature can benefit from them when they are providing different effects. This means Armored Magic can give a target both armor and shield, and Energy Resistance can grant resistance to multiple energy types to the same target. You gain the following aegis when you gain the Protection sphere:"

This is an immediate action that can be performed using any aegis you created that you have line of effect to. The resulting effect occurs to the creature that bore the aegis.

    "barrier maze [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "When you create a barrier, instead of having a wall at the edge of the ward, you may spend a spell point to create a number of cubes equal to twice your caster level. Each cube completely fills a 5 ft. square, and has 5 hit points, or 4 + your caster level hit points if you possess the Greater Barrier talent. Like a barrier, the cubes are mostly-transparent, and they block the same modes of attack. They are otherwise materially identical to a barrier, and have the same break DC. Objects and creatures can not be trapped within a cube, and the presence of a creature in a square prevents the cube from forming there. Cubes must be created at ground level, but can be joined into larger configurations. All cubes must be created within an area you could cover with a ward."

      "benefits": "You may repair any barrier you created (including those created using Greater Barrier) causing it to regain a number of hit points equal to 4 + your caster level. This is a move action, or you may spend a spell point to do this as a swift action. You must have line of sight to the barrier to use this talent. In addition, when you spend a spell point to maintain a barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make it self-repairing. The barrier regains 1 hit point + 1 hit point per 2 caster levels at the start of each of your turns. A barrier that has been reduced to 0 hp has been destroyed and cannot regain hit points or be restored using this talent. If used on a barrier comprised of cubes using the Barrier Maze talent, this talent allows each cube to regain 1 lost hit point or for 1 cube to regain all lost hit points when you spend a move action or a spell point and a swift action to use this ability. When you spend a spell point to maintain the barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make each cube regain 1 hit point per round.

    "continuous barrier [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "Barriers you create are completely sealed spheres. If creating the barrier would cause it to go through another object, the barrier cuts harmlessly through the material (without compromising the integrity of the object, but preventing the object from being moved). If creating the barrier would cause it to go through a creature or animated object, the barrier shunts the creature just outside the effect of the sphere. These modifications to your barriers make it so that ethereal creatures, or creatures with unusual movement modes such as burrow cannot enter the warded area by going around the barrier, but must instead destroy the barrier to enter or exit. This ability can be combined with Greater Barrier to allow your barrier wall to pass through objects."

    "glyph [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "At the time of casting a ward you may choose to shape the ward into a glyph: a magical trap whose effects are not immediately active until triggered. A glyph is cast upon a 5 ft. by 5 ft. area and takes the form of a 6 inch tall symbol, faintly visible on a surface. The glyph lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until activated by a trigger specified by the caster at the time it is created. When activated, the glyph become the center point for the ward, and it performs its function for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, and then the ability ends. Once cast, the glyph can not be moved from its location, and any attempt to do so fails. Destroying the surface the glyph is on destroys it, but doesn't end the glyph effect once it has been triggered. Creating a glyph requires a round per caster level and a spell point. You must also pay the spell point cost of whatever ward the glyph will create, though you do not need to spend a spell point to maintain the ward: the glyph can maintain the ward as if it were concentrating. When you create the glyph, you may decide what area is covered by the glyph's effect; this may be up to close range from the location of the glyph. A glyph is as intelligent as its caster, and can see and hear as well as a humanoid could with regular senses and a bonus to Perception equal to your caster level, so the trigger can be one of many things, but the glyph runs the risk of being deceived if the trigger is too complicated. A glyph can only have one trigger, but you can always trigger your own glyph as a free action, provided you are still on the same plane of existence. A glyph knows when it has been read. This information may be used as part of a trigger. When a glyph you created activates, its effect begins. The glyph's effect can be any ward you know how to create. If you have the Permanent Ward advanced talent, you may make a glyph that is permanent, and will activate with it's trigger, stay active for as long as the trigger is active, and shut off afterwards until triggered again. A glyph can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and can also be detected as a magical trap can be. In order for someone to spot one of your glyphs it requires a Perception Check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Disabling the glyph requires a Disable Device check with the same DC. Alternatively, destroying the surface the glyph is imprinted on can destroy the glyph, but once activated, destroying the glyph does not dispel the effect, and the glyph activates when damaged if the damage is not sufficient to destroy it."

    "greater barrier [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may fashion your barrier into a flat plane if you so choose. This wall must be contiguous and must begin adjacent to you, although it may extend as far out as Close range (if you possess the Distant Protection talent, it must begin within Close range and be contained within Medium range), and can cover up to 1\u00a010 ft square per caster level. In addition, when creating a barrier, you may spend an additional spell point to increase its Hit Points to 10 per caster level and increase the Break DC by 10.

Whenever the barrier regains or could regain hit points, you may change this decision."

    "shared aegis [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "In addition to providing an aura of protection, any aegis you create can be extended beyond the body of the creature bearing it. When a creature under the effects of an aegis you created has an allied creature within its natural reach, the ally also gains the benefit of the aegis. This requires active effort from the creature wearing the aegis, and they can not use their aegis to defend another creature if they would be denied their Dexterity bonus against the source of the effect they are protecting their ally from. While a creature is under the protection of your shared aegis this way, you may use succor talents that target them as if they were bearing the aegis. Only one creature may benefit from a succor this way."

When created, the aegis has an ablation rate of 20% + 5% for every 3 caster levels, maximum 50%. The aegis acts as a miss chance equal to its ablation rate against attacks, and whenever the protected creature is missed due to miss chance, it's ablation rate drops by 5%. When the ablation rate becomes equal to or less than 0, the aegis ends, even if the duration has not yet expired. If the character has a miss chance from another source, only the highest miss chance applies, and the aegis is only reduced if its ablation rate is higher than all other miss chances."

    "breathless (aegis) [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may create an aegis that allows a creature to survive without air.

    "impedance (aegis, ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that makes it difficult for creatures to approach the center of the ward.

This aegis has no effect on supernatural or extraordinary abilities, even if they duplicate the effects of a sphere, but it is effective against spell-like abilities that are built using that sphere.

When a peacebound ward is broken in this fashion, all creatures within become immune to that caster's peacebound ward for 24 hours. You may also create an aegis that makes the target immune to violent actions or magic. Any such action made against the target requires the attacker to pass a Will save or lose that action.

When this occurs, you must pay the spell point cost of the new aegis normally. You may activate plexing aegises on multiple creatures with the same action, provided all of them are being turned into the same kind of aegis. Once activated, the plexing aegis remains that aegis type for the remainder of its duration. The caster level of a plexing aegis is determined when it is cast and does not change once activated. A plexing aegis may be sacrificed to use a succor ability before or after it is activated. It costs a spell point to create a plexing aegis, just as with any other aegis. You may combine this talent with the mass aegis ability at the time of its casting, but not with the act of activating plexing aegises.

      "benefits": "When a creature successfully hits a creature you have placed an aegis on with an attack, you may sacrifice an aegis they are bearing as an immediate action to harm the attacker. The attacker takes 1d8 nonlethal damage per 2 caster levels (minimum: 1d8)."
    },

      "benefits": "When a creature with an aegis you created becomes the target of a spell or sphere ability that affects only them, you may sacrifice an aegis they are bearing as an immediate action to attempt to counterspell the ability and redirect the effect. You make a magical skill check against the magical skill defense of the caster, and if successful, the sphere effect affects the caster as if they had been the original target. Any bonuses you or the other sphere caster have to counterspelling apply to this roll. The decision to do this must be made before any attack roll or saving throw is made."

    "clarity (ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "Within the area of this ward, attempts to conceal, obfuscate, or disguise oneself are hindered. Any creature within the ward must make a Will save or they become unable to use any abilities to disguise or conceal themselves. Likewise, any spell, spell-like ability, or sphere ability that creates illusions or makes it difficult to sense physical phenomena is more difficult to use. When the ward is first created, the user makes a single magical skill check against every illusion or concealing effect created with a spell, spell-like ability, or sphere ability. Magic items have a MSD of 11 + their caster level and creatures using spell-like abilities have an MSD equal to 11 + their Hit Dice. If your check succeeds, the effect is suppressed or the magic item ceases to function, respectively. Time spent suppressed counts toward a magical effect's total duration. Any additional attempt to create an illusion or concealment effect requires the caster to beat your MSD with a magical skill check. They must do this even if they passed their Will saving throw."

    "exclusion (ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "You can create a ward that prevents entry of a common material or element chosen when you create the ward. You may choose an element based on their physical material (such as stone, metal, water, or acid), form of energy (such as fire or light) or based on their physical properties (such as poisonous materials or living materials). Magical and non-magical materials excluded have great difficulty entering the ward, but are unaffected once inside. Creatures made of or carrying the material with them must make a Strength check against a DC equal to your Protection sphere DC to cross the threshold of the ward, or they can simply drop any of the warded material they are carrying. An attack from outside the ward that crosses into the ward and is composed of the offending material receives a penalty to attack equal to your caster level."
    },
    "logic (ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "This ward presents subtle inconsistencies and misdirections that prevent entry. Creatures must have an Intelligence of at least 3 to enter into the warded area. Teleportation bypasses the effect of this ward, and low-intelligence creatures can still be pushed or otherwise motivated into the ward area by other more intelligent creatures or by accident."
    },
    "magnetic shield (ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "Creatures within this ward have damage reduction equal to your caster level against all metal weapons or metal tipped weapons, with the exception of silver weapons. This defense also applies to melee attacks by ironshod creatures or creatures that have metal covering the point of contact of the attack (such as a punch from someone wearing a gauntlet)."
    },
    "missile shield (ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that protects creatures within from projectiles, including projectile weapons, thrown rocks, rays made up of projectiles (such as created by the Stone Blast talent of the Destruction sphere) or falling debris. Any damage of that type dealt within this area is reduced by 5 + your caster level. These effects only absorb damage and may not protect from other side effects of an attack (like being pinned under the weight of a thrown boulder or being poisoned by a poisoned arrow)."
    },
    "quantum lock (ward) [abj. hb]": {
      "benefits": "You may create a ward that represses all effects that alter reality, including sphere abilities that change the rate of time, teleportation, gravitational effects, transdimensional effects, distortion of space, and Warp and Time sphere abilities within its area of effect. When this ward is created, make one magic skill check against each effect in the area of the ward that it can repress. Magic items have a MSD of 11 + their caster level. If your check exceeds the MSD of the magical effect or item, the effect is suppressed or the magic item ceases to function, respectively. Time spent suppressed counts toward a magical effect's total duration. Once in effect, any caster attempting to use an ability that can be repressed by this ward must attempt a magic skill check against your MSD. If they fail, the ability is negated completely (e.g., the creature never leaves its point of origin)."

      "benefits": "You may create a ward that repels creatures of one end of the alignment spectrum (good, evil, lawful, chaotic), chosen by you when this ward is created. All creatures of that alignment cannot cross the edge of this ward unless they succeed at a Will save. Once a creature has succeeded at this Will save, they may cross the barrier without trouble and are immune to your repel ward for 24 hours. If a creature is already within this warded area when it is created, or if the ward is moved into their space, they instantly become immune to the ward, as if they had succeeded at their saving throw. You cannot repel an alignment that you yourself possess."
    },
    "the abjurer": {
      "benefits": "The abjurer is the most dedicated of Protection casters, and will likely have the most Protection talents. Before any battle, they will place aegises they expect to be useful on their allies (and perhaps a Plexing Aegis on each ally), and then place general purpose wards during battle. They are more reactive than other Protection casters; waiting until the enemy acts so they can determine the best way to defend their allies, and then putting the right aegis or ward into place to make their allies completely immune to attack using Expedited Defense. They are also more likely to have (succor) talents that let them sacrifice superfluous aegises."
    },
    "the architect": {
      "benefits": "The architect likes to control the battlefield by placing multiple wards. Like the abjurer, they attempt to neutralize the actions of their enemies, but they prefer to do this by covering the battlefield with wards rather than attempting to make their allies immune. Their main tactic is to place a barrier ward as soon as possible, and they will have many talents to strengthen it such as Buttressing, while using Selective Barrier to allow their ranged allies to hide behind it. Talents such as Barrier Maze and Greater Barrier can also be extremely useful for when fights turn into chaotic rumbles."
    },
    "the countermage": {
      "benefits": "The countermage has only one thing to say to their enemies: \"No.\" The countermage controls the battle not by protecting their allies or even by attacking their enemies, but by neutralizing the abilities of their enemies. By negating the most powerful spells an enemy throws out, they can rob the enemy of any chance of victory. They likely possess several counterspell feats backed up by a smaller number of (aegis) and (ward) talents that protect from common spells, such as Neutralization and Spell Ward."
    },
    "the field marshal": {
      "benefits": "The field marshal is less likely to be a dedicated Protection caster than others. In fact, they're much more likely to be martial combatants. A field marshal will often have a few (aegis) talents that they will cast on themselves and allies (assuming they don't take the Personal Defense drawback), and possibly one or two wards to deal with certain situations that they are ill-equipped to handle (like Quantum Lock or Missile Shield if they are melee combatants). They will not have many wards, however, as they would rather use their combat actions to attack rather than to spellcast."
    },
    "the punisher": {
      "benefits": "The punisher only dabbles in the Protection sphere, and is interested in only the most consistently useful forms of defense. They then enhance these defenses with (succor) talents that harm enemies who attack their allies, transforming those defenses into weapons. The Painful Aegis, Ray Deflection, Reflection, and Vengeance talents are common among punishers. With their heavy investment in (succor) talents, Mystic Shell is extremely useful to them."

    "bludgeon": {
      "benefits": "The Bludgeon option of telekinesis was addressed in errata to read: \"Once per turn when lifting an object with telekinesis, you can relinquish its remaining movement (if any) to strike a creature or object within its square. You must succeed at an attack roll using your base attack bonus plus your casting ability against the target. On a successful hit, the target and the bludgeon take damage depending on the bludgeon's size. If the bludgeon is a weapon, the attack deals appropriate damage for that weapon (bolts and arrows are treated as daggers for this purpose). Since weapons are designed to deal damage, they do not suffer damage if used as a bludgeon.\" The damage type of Bludgeon depends on the object being wielded, but generally deals bludgeoning damage. However, a spiked grate might deal bludgeoning and piercing damage, while a shaving razor would deal slashing damage. A Bludgeon always deals a form of weapon damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), though it might be used to attack someone with an object that deals additional damage of another type (such as wooden object that has been set on fire). You do not need to be proficient with a weapon to use it effectively as a Bludgeon, and you do not take non-proficiency or improvised weapon penalties to your attack roll with a Bludgeon. When using an object as a bludgeon, any special properties that would apply to wielding it as a weapon apply to it as a bludgeon. A masterwork or enchanted weapon gains its enhancement bonus, and it uses any relevant special weapon abilities. A chunk of adamantine will overcome adamantine-keyed damage reduction and ignore hardness less than 20, and a lit torch will deal fire damage. The GM has final say on whether or not a property functions when the weapon is used as a bludgeon (example: flaming would cause the bludgeon to deal additional fire damage, but throwing would do nothing, as the weapon is the weapon is not being 'thrown' in a traditional sense.)"
    },
    "catch": {
      "benefits": "If using telekinesis on a projectile or thrown object within your size limit (often as a readied action), you may stop the attack from dealing damage. The originator of the attack (the creature who threw the projectile, etc.) is allowed a Will save to negate this ability. After Catching an object, you may move it as normal for your telekinesis."
    },
    "hostile lift": {
      "benefits": "Not only can you telekinetically move an unwilling creature with Hostile Lift, they become unable to move themselves normally while they are subject to it. They can still act in other ways such as wielding a weapon or casting a spell, take no penalties to defending themselves and gain their full set of actions in a round, but cannot physically move from the position until you are no longer maintaining your hostile lift, or until they succeed on the effect's Will save. Acceleration Acceleration can benefit from feats or abilities that would give you a full attack at the end of a Charge (such as pounce), but even in conjunction with Divided Mind and/or Mobile Bludgeon you are still limited to your normal number of attacks each round. Dancing Weapon Because dancing weapons are controlled as if you were wielding them, they can threaten the areas around them. However, dancing weapons do not possess the natural reach of a wielder. Instead, a dancing weapon has reach that corresponds to its object size. Tiny and smaller objects only threaten the square they are positioned in, while weapons with the reach gain the normal benefits and drawbacks. Even if you are lifting multiple weapons with Divided Mind, you are limited to your normal amount of attacks of opportunity each round. Table: Dancing Weapon Reach Size \n Reach \n \n \n Fine \n 0 ft \n \n \n Diminutive \n 0 ft \n \n \n Tiny \n 0 ft \n \n \n Small \n 5 ft \n \n \n Medium \n 5 ft \n \n \n Large \n 5 ft \n \n \n Huge \n 10 ft \n \n \n Gargantuan \n 15 ft \n \n \n Colossal \n 20 ft You can flank with your own Dancing Weapon. Divided Mind When combining sizes to determine how much you can lift with Divided Mind, two objects of the same size category are equivalent to one object of a larger category. For example, two Small objects are equal to one Medium object, and four Medium objects are equal to two Large objects, or one Huge object. When making multiple bludgeon attacks per round with Divided Mind you must use a different object for each bludgeon attack unless you have the Mobile Bludgeon talent. When using multiple lifted objects as a single bludgeon, combine their size and determine damage as if they were a single object of that size. If one or more of these objects is a weapon the size category is effectively one size larger when determining damage. You add all weapon damage types together when using multiple objects as a single bludgeon-\u2014so a bludgeon composed of blunt objects would only do bludgeoning damage, while if you later added a shortspear to the objects you wielded it would deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. Quick Reference Table: Density of Common Materials Density \n Material \n Effective size \n \n \n Superdense \n Adamantine, lead, gold, silver \n One size larger \n \n \n Dense \n Flesh, iron, mithral, sand, soil, stone, water, wood \n Standard size \n \n \n Light \n Charcoal, cork, darkwood, flour, hay, snow \n One size smaller \n \n \n Weightless \n Balsa wood, featherglass, feathers, shredded paper \n Two sizes smaller The density table assumes the substance is packed together in a natural manner - if this changes, the density is altered as well. While a hollow sculpture of carefully joined paper sheets is effectively weightless, a bound book of paper sheets is little different in density than the wood it was made from. Similarly, while lightly packed snow is light, a drift from a new, dry snowfall could be weightless, while the snow comprising the terrain of an ancient glacier is dense. In general, density categories follow the density of water as a baseline. Materials or objects ten times as dense as water are superdense, materials and objects half the density of water are light, while materials and objects a tenth the density of water are weightless. Note that a weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. For example, a one-handed club sized for a medium creature is an object of tiny size. In general, adjust size category as follows: Table: Weapon Sizes Weapon Type \n Size Adjustment \n \n \n Ammunition \n Three sizes smaller \n \n \n Light Weapons \n Two sizes smaller \n \n \n One-Handed Weapons \n One size smaller \n \n \n Two-Handed Weapons \n Same size This is a general guideline to weapon size rather than a hard rule, and exceptions exist (such as daggers which are three sizes smaller, or shurikens which are four). The exact size of a given weapon is ultimately up to the GM.

    "sustained force": {
      "benefits": "As a free action, you can spend a spell point to no longer need to concentrate to maintain lifting a particular object for up to 1 minute per caster level. You may give a Sustained Force simple orders (float in the air, go north, follow a target) that it obeys to the best of its ability, to a maximum of your telekinesis range. Changing a Sustained Force's orders is a move action. You cannot sustain combat-related uses of telekinesis (combat maneuvers, Bludgeons, etc.), nor complicated tasks (make a wagon load itself with stones and move them to another location, etc.). You may dismiss a Sustained Force as a standard action. Wiki Note: Telekinesis and Attack Actions You generally cannot make more than one attack action per round, even when using Telekinesis to manipulate multiple weapons and attacking with them individually. Wiki Note: Telekinesis and Maneuvers Maneuvers created by telekinesis talents do not originate from you and do not work with many effects that require that (such as many combat talents) unless you have an additional ability allowing this. Telekinesis Talents"

    "acceleration": {
      "benefits": "When you move a target with telekinesis you can double the distance you can move it that turn by having all of its movement be in a straight line. An object that moves at least 10 ft this way before being used as a bludgeon is counted as having made a Charge and gains the related +2 on its attack roll. If you also possess the Flair talent, you may apply Charge related feats to your Charge with that bludgeon."
    },
    "dampening field": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you can wrap a willing creature or object within range of your telekinesis in cushioning force, granting them DR/Piercing equal to half your caster level. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, or you may spend a spell point to sustain it with Sustained Force."

    "dancing weapon": {
      "benefits": "You may add your casting ability modifier to all damage rolls made with a Bludgeon. Additionally, your Bludgeons count as either a ranged, thrown, or melee weapon under your control, as determined by the caster. A caster may change a Bludgeon from one to the other once per round but a single Bludgeon cannot count as more than one at the same time. You may make attack actions with your Bludgeon, though doing so is not combinable with making a full attack, unless using Divided Mind or Mobile Bludgeon. You may apply appropriate feats and combat talents such as Power Attack to your actions with that Bludgeon, and if treating an object as a melee weapon, the Bludgeon has a reach and threatens the area around it as if wielded by a creature of the same size as the Bludgeon. You are considered to be wielding the weapon for the purpose of making attacks of opportunity or flanking, but do not suffer penalties for oversized or undersized weapons. Author's Note:  You cannot use attack actions with a full attack using Dancing Weapon. You have the option of one or the other."

    "divided mind [mass]": {
      "benefits": "You may lift multiple targets at once (up to 1 + 1 per caster level) whose combined size does not exceed your maximum telekinesis size. You may treat these objects as one effective object for the purpose of Bludgeoning a creature, or you may make multiple Bludgeons per round (although you cannot make more attacks in a round than would otherwise be allowed with your base attack bonus and any respective feats or combat talents if you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, applying penalties for full attacks as normal). If you spend a spell point to use Hostile Lift or Sustained Force, it may apply it to as many of these objects as applicable as if each were a different effect. You may also spend a spell point when using the Steal, Telekinetic Maneuver, or Telekinetic Push talents to affect multiple targets at once (up to one additional target per 2 caster levels, minimum 1), although you cannot affect an individual target more than once per round with any push or combat maneuver."

    "excessive force [bap]": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you could perform a Bludgeon as part of a standard action or greater, you may instead violently slam the target under your telekinesis into another object or against a surface (such as a wall or floor). The target takes damage appropriate to its size, as though used as a Bludgeon, plus an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels and must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone from the force of the impact. The impacted object or surface takes the damage appropriate to the target's size but does not take any additional damage from this effect. If you possess the Acceleration talent, you may choose to have the impacted object or surface also take this effect's additional damage (in addition to the Bludgeon's damage). In addition, you may use this talent when performing a single Bludgeon as part of a standard action or greater. Instead of making an attack roll, both the Bludgeon and the target must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage appropriate to the Bludgeon's size plus this effect's additional damage and fall prone. Using this talent ends your telekinesis on the creature or object used to perform the Bludgeon."

    "finesse": {
      "benefits": "You may use telekinesis to perform fine manipulations, such as turning a key in a lock, unrolling a scroll, or tying a knot. You may attempt appropriate skill checks (such as Craft, Disable Device, Profession, or Performance checks that involve objects or instruments, but not Sleight of Hand or other checks involving attended objects unless you possess the Steal talent) at a distance, as well as Heal checks to perform first aid. When performing a skill at a distance you may use your casting ability modifier in place of the normal ability modifier, but you also suffer a -5 penalty to the skill check and cannot take 10. You may also use Sustained Force to maintain complicated, non-combat procedures such as making knives prepare dinner, make a lute play itself, or making a shovel dig a ditch."
    },
    "flight": {
      "benefits": "When using telekinesis to lift a creature or creatures and spending a spell point to create a Sustained Force on them, you may grant that creature the ability to control their own movement for the duration of the Sustained Force. They gain a fly speed equal to your telekinesis speed, with maneuverability (perfect). When affecting a target with a Sustained Force, they no longer need to remain within your telekinesis range."
    },
    "floating shield": {
      "benefits": "When using your telekinesis to lift a shield, you may apply its shield bonus to the armor class of anything in its square, though this does not stack with any shield bonus they already possess. A shield sustained with Sustained Force still grants its shield bonus, and may be directed to follow a given individual or target. If you possess the Orbit talent, you may choose a single shield in orbit of you and add its shield bonus to your armor class. If you possess the Flair talent, you may apply shield related feats (such as Shield Focus) to any shield you are lifting."

    "forceful telekinesis": {
      "benefits": "When you using an object or weapon as a bludgeon, it is effectively one size larger for determining how much damage it deals.

    "gravity shift": {
      "benefits": "By concentrating your telekinetic powers on an area you may effectively increase or decrease the area's gravity. As a standard action you may alter the gravity of a 10 ft radius + 5 ft per five caster levels area anywhere within range of your telekinesis. As long as you concentrate, the area becomes either an area of heavy gravity or an area of light gravity. You may also change the type of gravity in the area as a move action. This talent can be used to alter areas that are already heavy or light gravity, either altering them to normal gravity or doubling their effects, but cannot be used in areas of no gravity or subjective gravity. You may spend a spell point to sustain this effect with Sustained Force. Heavy Gravity:  In heavy gravity areas, Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, and Swim checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character's speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character's Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters that fall in areas of heavy gravity take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage. Light Gravity:  Characters in an area of light gravity gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and on Acrobatics and Ride checks. All items weigh half as much, and weapon ranges double. Strength and Dexterity don't change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. Falling characters in light gravity take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d4)."

    "gravity ward/well": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you can create an area of gravity that either pulls objects in or keeps them out. Select either yourself or a spot within range of your telekinesis, and choose either to attract or repel. If you choose attract, all creatures and unattended objects of up to your telekinesis limit within 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels of the chosen spot are drawn in a straight line to the unoccupied space nearest to the center of the effect. Unwilling creatures are subjected to a drag combat maneuver using your caster level plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. A creature in the area of this effect cannot move away from the center of the effect except by attempting the drag combat maneuver as a move action against a CMD equal to 10 plus your caster level plus your casting ability modifier, moving the indicated distance away from the center of the gravity well. If you choose repel, this functions the same way except creatures and unattended objects within the area are pushed in a straight line away from the center of the effect, and creatures are subjected to and perform bull rush combat maneuvers instead of drag combat maneuvers. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate (pulling or pushing creatures each round on your turn) and can be maintained with Sustained Force."

    },
    "homing": {
      "benefits": "When you miss with a Bludgeon attack, you may spend a spell point as an immediate action to make the bludgeon home back in on the target. For a number of rounds equal to your caster level the object single-mindedly moves towards the target without you needing to concentrate on it, taking the shortest path as it attempts to attack them each turn. A bludgeon directed this way can only make one attack per turn, and once it makes a single successful attack it stops pursuing the target and drops to the ground unless you begin concentrating on it again. If you possess the Divided Mind talent you may pay a single spell point to make multiple objects pursue a target, but as soon as any one of them makes a successful attack, they all stop pursuing."

      "benefits": "You may choose to maintain concentration on your telekinesis as a swift action. However, targets of your telekinesis remain motionless while you concentrate on them this way, hovering in place. You cannot move them, use them to bludgeon, or direct them to perform tasks. Dancing Weapons that hover do not threaten their range or provide flanking bonuses, and you may not apply the benefits of Telekinetic Crush to hovering targets. In addition, this talent cannot be used to concentrate on a Hostile Lift."

    "kinetic field": {
      "benefits": "By spending a spell point as a standard action you can use your telekinesis to create a stationary flat plane of kinetic energy that stops incoming projectiles and thrown objects. Any such object with a size one less than what you can lift with telekinesis that strikes the field immediately loses momentum and drops to the ground if the originator of the attack fails a Will save. This field is created adjacent to you and has a length equal to 20 ft + 5 ft per 5 caster levels and lasts so long as you concentrate, or you may spend a spell point to maintain it with Sustained Force."
    },
    "kinetic sense": {
      "benefits": "You no longer need to see to levitate objects or creatures with your telekinesis. As long as you target the correct space the target is in, you may lift it without needing line of sight. If you target an incorrect square your action is wasted, though you retain any spell points you would have spent. In addition, you may spend a spell point to gain 30 ft blindsense for one minute per caster level."

      "benefits": "When you use your telekinesis to make a bludgeon attack, you may continue to move the object after the attack roll is made if it has any movement remaining. Alternately, you may choose to forfeit any remaining movement in order to make a full attack with a single bludgeon, making as many attacks as your base attack bonus allows, including extra attacks gained from feats if you possess the Flair or Dancing Weapon talents. If you are lifting multiple bludgeons with Divided Mind you are still limited to one full attack, but may divide your attacks among your bludgeons in any way you desire."

    "orbit": {
      "benefits": "When you lift an object with your telekinesis and move it into your square or drop an item you are holding, you may place it in a passive orbit around you. An object in orbit drifts slowly around you, moving with you when you move as if you carried it, and does not require concentration to remain in orbit, though it does nothing except drift passively. At any point you may begin concentrating on it again, directing it and using it normally with your telekinesis, or you may pick up an item in orbit as a free action. You may have multiple objects around you at one time so long as their total size does not exceed the size limit of orbit, shown below. If you possess the Powerful Telekinesis talent, your orbit limit increases by a single size category. If you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, you may use a single object in orbit of you to make attacks of opportunity on your behalf. Items caught with Catch may immediately be placed into orbit. You may not use Hostile Lift in conjunction with Orbit.

On a failed Reflex save, the target becomes trapped for 1 round per caster level, effectively sealing the target off from all other creatures. The trapped target cannot move from their space except by means of dimensional travel, such as teleport from the Warp sphere, but is still trapped even if moved by such an effect. The target treats all other creatures as though they had total cover against it, and all other creatures treat the target as though it has total cover against them. A trapped target may attempt a Reflex saving throw or Escape Artist check as a full-round action with a DC equal to this effect's DC to escape and end this effect. If the target takes damage while trapped, they may attempt a check to escape as a free action which can be taken even if it is not their turn."
    },
    "parry": {
      "benefits": "You may use the Catch function of telekinesis to block attacks with melee weapons, though they retain their hold on their weapon even if you successfully block their attack. However, if you possess the Steal talent as well, you may immediately use it on that weapon as part of a successful catch. Your telekinesis must be specially tuned towards the task, so when you ready an action to Catch (or when you spend a spell point on the Catch Shield talent, if you possess it) you must specify whether your telekinesis can intercept melee or ranged attacks."

    "powerful telekinesis": {
      "benefits": "Increase the maximum-sized object or creature you may affect with telekinesis by 1 size category."
    },
    "quick reactions": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to make a telekinetic Catch as an immediate action. If you possess the Telekinetic Push talent, you may spend a spell point to perform pushes as an immediate action. If you possess Kinetic Field, you may spend a spell point as a standard action to fold kinetic energy around yourself to create a catch field. This catch field moves with you and lasts 1 round per 3 caster levels (minimum 1). Once per round this stops a projectile aimed at you as if you were using Catch. You cannot have more than one use of this ability active at any one time."
    },
    "return": {
      "benefits": "When you stop a ranged attack with telekinetic catch, you may immediately fling it back at the attacker if they're in range of your telekinesis. Resolve this as a standard bludgeon attack using the object you were attacked with. Return may not be used in conjunction with Catch Shield."
    },
    "seizing strike [strike] [3pp]": {
      "benefits": "Source:  Expanded Spheres: Baron's Lost Apocrypha As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with using a lift. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also affected by lift. If using a scatter weapon, the lift only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack. The target of your attack must be a legal target for your lift."
    },
    "steal": {
      "benefits": "You may use telekinesis on attended objects. You may perform a disarm or steal combat maneuver against a target using telekinesis, using your caster level plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. You may use telekinesis to perform Sleight of Hand checks at a distance as well and may use your casting ability modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier for this purpose, but you also suffer a -5 penalty to the skill check and cannot take 10. If the maneuver or skill check is successful, you may move the lifted object up to your telekinesis distance in any direction, but may not use it as a Bludgeon as part of the same action."
    },
    "sweeping bludgeons [bap]": {
      "benefits": "Whenever you perform a Bludgeon, instead of making an attack roll, you may choose to swing the Bludgeon in a sweeping arc at the target. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or both the target and the Bludgeon take damage depending on the Bludgeon's size. If you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, you may use abilities which would apply additional damage or effects to a single attack action to the Bludgeon damage dealt to the target with this talent. If an effect would impose a penalty to an attack roll, such as Lancer sphere impale or the Power Attack feat, you instead reduce the DC of the Reflex saving throw by that amount. Example:  If you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, your Bludgeon damage could include additional damage from a Berserker sphere brutal strike, Duelist sphere blooded strike bleed damage, or the Vital Strike feat, but not other attack actions or effects which do not affect the Bludgeon's damage, such as barrage or dual attack. Attack actions or effects which do not affect the Bludgeon's damage, such as barrage or dual attack, instead apply a penalty to the Bludgeon's saving throw."
    },
    "telekinetic crush": {
      "benefits": "When using your telekinesis on a target, you may crush it with your grip. Every round you maintain concentration you may deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and an additional 1d6 per 5 caster levels. Alternately, you may make a Strength check to break an object you are holding with your telekinesis, using your casting ability modifier + 1 per five caster levels as your bonus on the check instead of your Strength modifier. You may use this on sections of a larger object than you can lift with your telekinesis, allowing you to punch holes through walls or rip down doors so long as you can lift the targeted section."
    },
    "telekinetic maneuver": {
      "benefits": "You can use telekinesis to manipulate a target with more finesse than a Hostile Lift. You may target a creature with telekinesis to perform a bull rush, drag, reposition, trip, dirty trick, or grapple (upgrades to pin if the target is already grappled) combat maneuver against a target, ignoring size limitations. Use your caster level plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. If grappling, your CMD is your telekinesis CMB + 10 and the target is allowed to attempt a Will save each round after the grapple is initiated to negate the effect, just as they can with Hostile Lift. These maneuvers do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target. If grappling, you do not gain the grappled condition, and you cannot be knocked prone by failing a trip check."
    },
    "telekinetic push": {
      "benefits": "You may throw your telekinetic power at an object, aiding or impeding its natural movement. As a readied action, you may push a projectile, creature, thrown object, or another caster's Bludgeon up to one size larger than your telekinesis limit. If aiding, you may increase a weapon's range increment by half your telekinesis speed and increase its effective size by 1 size category +1 per 5 caster levels for the purposes of dealing damage and determining if another caster may Catch the object with their own telekinesis. If aiding a creature, you may choose to instead grant it an enhancement bonus to its movement equal to 1/2 your telekinesis speed. You may also add 1d6 damage + 1d6 per 5 caster levels to the falling damage a target suffers. This ability may be used to cause damage to a target that was successfully tripped. Alternatively, you may slow down a creature or object, cutting its movement speed in half. If the target is falling, this decreases their falling speed to 60 feet per round, allowing them to fall great distances without being hurt. When you use the Catch function of your telekinesis, you may also choose to deflect an object instead of Catching it, causing it to simply miss instead of being lifted with telekinesis. Telekinetic Push still requires a spell point when used directly on hostile targets, but does not allow a Will save to negate, even when used with Catch, due to the briefer contact and more indirect force. Telekinetic Pushes cannot be sustained with Sustained Force."
    },
    "telekinetic tools": {
      "benefits": "You may use your telekinesis to mimic simple tools, such a shovels, hammers, or scissors by using your telekinesis as if manipulating an item of the appropriate size. If you possess Finesse talent, you may mimic tools associated with any of the listed skills, allowing you to Perform without an instrument or pick a lock without thieves tools if you also have Flair. In addition, if you possess the Telekinetic Maneuver talent, when grappling a target you may choose to use the tie up grapple action to restrain them with telekinetic force instead of a rope. A creature successfully tied up this way is bound and helpless, and must follow the tie up rules to escape their bonds. This restraining force lasts until broken by a successful CMB check, until they receive help from an outside force as a full round action, or until you dismiss it. A target cannot attempt a Will save to negate the effects of these bonds, or a strength check to break them."
    },
    "tether": {
      "benefits": "You can create a telekinetic connection between two objects of any size, tethering them together. As a standard action you can tether two targets within 30 ft of each other, preventing them from moving further than 30 ft from each other without either breaking the tether or dragging the other target with them. An unwilling creature gets a Reflex save to avoid being tethered. A creature dragging an object follows the normal carrying capacity and encumbrance rules, but must use the drag combat maneuver to drag an unwilling creature. The tether may be broken as a move action with a Strength check equal to the tether's save DC. A tether lasts as long as you concentrate and an additional number of rounds after that equal to your caster level. You may spend a spell point to maintain a tether with Sustained Force."

    "whirlwind assembly": {
      "benefits": "As a swift action you can use your telekinesis to ready yourself for any given situation. You may draw up to two sheathed weapons or items you are carrying (even if it is stored in a backpack or similar container) and put away up to two objects you are holding in your hands. In addition, you may don a single set of armor or robes and put away any robes or armor you are currently wearing, or swap out any number of smaller worn items (such as gloves, hats, or rings).

    "affix": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Effortless Telekinesis (advanced), Idle Concentration), caster level 10th By spending two spell points, you may permanently affix a single object you are lifting with your telekinesis to a specific point in space. This is an instantaneous effect that binds the object to that specific point, preventing it from moving in any direction even due to gravity. An unwilling creature lifted through the use of Hostile Lift gains an immediate opportunity to break your telekinetic hold with a Will save. If the save fails they remain held by your telekinesis, and must attempt a Reflex save to avoid being fixed in place permanently with no further saves. A creature affected by Affix can still take actions and can freely move their limbs, but cannot move away from the point they have been affixed to, even with teleportation effects. Since this is an instantaneous effect, it cannot be dispelled. However, a successful application of telekinesis or brute force can break an object free with a magic skill check or Strength check against your MSD + 4. If applying your own telekinesis against an object you have affixed, you automatically succeed on your magic skill check. This effect can also be ended by the Make Whole advanced talent from the Life sphere, the Freedom (word) from the Fate sphere, or the freedom of movement spell."
    },
    "astral affixation": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Affix (advanced), Effortless Telekinesis (advanced), Idle Concentration), caster level 15th. When you affix a target permanently in place, you may spend an additional spell point to strengthen the effect by pinning them to astral leylines. A creature that has failed its Reflex save against being affixed must succeed at a third save or be rendered paralyzed for as long as they are affixed. In addition, regardless of whether or not this additional save is failed, breaking a target free that has been affixed in this way requires a successful magic skill check or Strength check against your MSD + 10. In addition, a telekinesis effect or the Freedom word with a lower caster level than the affixing will always be insufficient and cannot break a target free."

    "choking grasp": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Telekinetic Crush), caster level 15th. As either a stand-alone standard action or as part of maintaining a Hostile Lift, you may spend 2 spell points to suffocate a target within your telekinesis range. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or have its hit points drop to 0 and fall unconscious on its next turn as if it had failed a Constitution check against suffocation. Next round, the target must succeed at a second Fortitude save or drop to -1 hit points begin dying. In the round following that they must succeed at another Fortitude save or suffocate and die. Succeeding on any of these saves prevents further saves and stops the effects from worsening, but does not negate the effects of any previously failed saves. This talent only affects living creatures that must breathe."
    },
    "disperse force": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Quick Reactions, Telekinetic Push), caster level 10th. You can apply an opposing force at the right times, canceling out offensive forces. As an immediate action whenever you would take damage, you may spend two spell points to negate that damage. You may use this to respond to energy or magic based attacks, and you may even use it to insulate you against environmental hazards (such as acid rain or lava) but it is ineffective against damage from internal or nonphysical sources (such as bleed damage or a mental attack)."

    "effortless telekinesis": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere, caster level 10th. When you use your telekinesis to lift creatures or objects and spend a spell point to create a Sustained Force on them, the Sustained Force persists for 1 hour per caster level instead of 1 minute per caster level."
    },
    "focused power": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Powerful Telekinesis), caster level 5th. By spending a spell point you can further advance the strength of your telekinesis. Increase the maximum sized object you can affect with telekinesis by 1 size category. This effect stacks with the benefits of Powerful Telekinesis. However, the action required to concentrate on the effect is increased by one step, and you may not spend a spell point to maintain it with Sustained Force. You may spend an additional spell point to increase your capacity by another size, but doing so demands all of your mental focus. You may only use the basic capability of telekinesis to move objects, and cannot use this in conjunction with Hostile Lift or Bludgeon."
    },
    "gravity manipulation": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Gravity Shift), caster level 15th. When you use Gravity Shift, you may spend two spell points (instead of one, if you are already spending a spell point for Gravity Shift, otherwise you must spend both) to have greater control over gravity. You may create or manipulate areas of no gravity or objective gravity, and may apply any gravity trait to any area. Creatures in the area may attempt a Reflex save to hang onto an adjacent surface whenever you change gravity. No Gravity:  Individuals in an area of no gravity merely float in space, unless other resources are available to provide a direction for gravity's pull. Objective Gravity:  The strength of objective gravity is the same as normal, but the direction is not the traditional \"down\" toward the ground. It may be down towards any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the ground itself, or even upward."
    },
    "linear acceleration": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Acceleration, Greater Speed), caster level 10th. You may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to fling an object you are currently lifting at immense speeds, tying it to a target or location within line of sight, causing it to immediately pass out of your control as it races towards that target, to a maximum distance of 5 miles. This cannot be used to hurl objects into the air nor to attempt to hurl them in an arc for greater distance; the targeted creature, object, or location must be within direct line of sight and line of effect. By making a successful ranged touch attack, using your casting ability modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier, against the target you deal double the normal Bludgeon damage to it. If the attack misses, the object strikes the center of the target's space. The object's impact into the target or their space releases a powerful shockwave and everyone in a 30-foot radius + 5 feet per five caster levels, including the initial target, takes 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels and is dazed for one round. A Fortitude save negates the dazed condition, though the initial target is not allowed a saving throw if the touch attack succeeded. Objects fired using Linear Acceleration suffer the full initial and secondary damage of the attack."

    "puppet": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Finesse, Telekinetic Maneuver), caster level 10th. When you lift a creature with your telekinesis you may spend a spell point to take precise control over their physical form. You can force them to run, jump, manipulate objects, and wield weapons, but you cannot force them to use special abilities such as spells that are not a function of bodily movement, and cannot take control of their vocal cords, though you can prevent them from making sounds. If you force the subject to engage in combat, use an attack bonus equal to your base attack plus your casting ability modifier, and substitute your casting ability modifier for any ability modifiers on damage rolls. In addition, substitute your casting ability modifier for the subject's Dexterity modifier when determining armor class. When performing actions that would require a skill check, use your skill ranks plus your casting ability modifier for the check. Since the subject is only under your physical control, on their turn they can still take purely mental actions. You must use Hostile Lift to affect an unwilling creature, and they are allowed the normal Will saves to negate the effect. Telekinesis Sphere Feats"

Benefit:  Whenever you use the (metal) geomancing Recover Ore ability, you may use telekinesis to Bludgeon another target creature or object with the metal ore recovered in this way, all as part of the same action. If you increase the casting time by 1 step (usually from a standard to full-round action), you may utilize your caster level instead of your base attack bonus for the first attack roll, and add your casting ability modifier to damage."

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere, Telekinesis sphere. Benefit:  By amplifying and focusing the tiny pressure exerted by light with your powers of telekinesis, you can move a target with the force of light alone. When you cause a target to glow, you may increase the casting time by one step to also lift it with your telekinesis as part of the same action. If using Area Glow, you can lift multiple objects if you also possess Divided Mind. You may concentrate to maintain the bright light of this glow and your telekinesis with a single action."

Objects made this way cannot incorporate any other materials and must be simple in construction, lacking intricate details or complex moving parts. This 'material' has hardness 10 and 3 hit points per inch, has no weight and cannot be moved, save by you through telekinesis. At the end of each round its hit points are fully replenished.

If you push or pull an object that does not move (for example, a building or the ground/ an object pushed into the ground) you may instead apply the movement to yourself, using the stalled momentum of your telekinesis to push or pull yourself in the opposite direction. This means that, as a standard action, you can move yourself at a speed equal to double your telekinesis speed but only towards or away from a stationary object that you can affect with telekinesis (if you end in the air, you do not fall until the end of your next turn). You may grant yourself this ability as a sustained force, gaining a fly speed equal to twice your telekinesis speed, but may only move in a single direction per move action that is toward or away from an appropriate object for telekinesis."

Benefit:  By weaving your illusions together with a hint of telekinetic force you can allow them to exert force more appropriate to their apparent nature. Your illusions can support weight or block movement of creatures or objects so long as all pressure and weight on it falls within the size limit of your telekinesis. However, anyone who disbelieves the illusion may choose to ignore the telekinetic effect, moving through the illusion as normal, as well as allowing them to throw or move items through it. In addition, you may deal lethal damage with your illusions instead of nonlethal damage. Protokinesis Feats Protokinesis feats represent innate telekinetic abilities, powers usable with minimal thought and effort in contrast to the magic of the  Telekinesis  sphere. They often develop unintentionally, without need for training or even awareness of them. Unless noted otherwise, the benefit granted by any protokinesis feat is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. In addition, protokinesis feats do not function when you are unconscious. The effects of protokinesis feats last indefinitely unless otherwise noted, though they may be dismissed as a free action, or restarted as a standard action if they have been dispelled or dismissed. Protokinesis Feats and Class Features The classes in the following table may select a protokinesis feat as one of the following class features. As long as they have the casting class feature they need not have the Telekinesis sphere (but must meet all other prerequisites) and treat their class level as their caster level for the purpose of that feat. This stacks with caster levels from other sources normally. In addition, incanters, along with wizards and sorcerers who have an archetype that replaces spells with the casting class feature, may select protokinesis feats as bonus feats or bloodline feats and need not have the Telekinesis sphere to qualify.

Benefit:  When an enemy performs a combat maneuver against you, you may spend an immediate action to roll your own bull rush check opposing your opponent's, using your caster level as your base attack bonus and adding your casting ability modifier instead of your Strength modifier but adding any other modifiers excluding size modifiers to bull rush checks you may have. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If your result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's combat maneuver fails. If you beat it by at least 5, they instead are forced 5 feet directly away from you for every 5 by which your roll exceeds theirs. This movement counts as your bull rush for the purpose of determining whether the enemy provokes attacks of opportunity, but not for any other purposes."

Gamemastering Clarifications This section is devoted to elaborating on existing Spheres of Power material, clarifying and offering suggestions for specific situations or uses of the Telekinesis Sphere. Telekinesis Items lifted by telekinesis are considered to be attended or held by the creature lifting them. If a character attempts to use telekinesis on a target that is under the effect of another character's telekinesis, he must make a successful CMB check against their CMD to wrest control of the target. While most things a telekinetic will want to lift are solid, discrete objects, it is possible that you will want to lift a fluid or less cohesive mass, such as a pool of water or a pile of sand. The recommended default is that a telekinetic should be able to lift a mass equal to their standard telekinesis size limit, but under certain circumstances or in different settings a GM might want to impose stricter limits. A GM might choose to rule that some substances are more difficult than normal to manipulate with telekinesis (such as gases or more volatile fluids such as alchemist's fire) and impose an effective size penalty, or say that cannot effectively be lifted with telekinesis at all without the proper skills. In such cases it is recommended that the Telekinetic Tools talent could be used to mimic a sack or bucket to scoop up fluids and fine grains, and the Finesse talent allowed to properly handle volatile chemicals or more tricky materials such as gases."

      "benefits": "You may, as a free action, spend a spell point to no longer need to concentrate to maintain lifting a particular object for up to 1 minute per caster level. You may give a sustained force simple orders (float in the air, go north, follow a target) that it obeys to the best of its ability. Changing a sustained force's orders is a move action. You cannot sustain combat-related uses of telekinesis (combat maneuvers, bludgeons, etc.), nor complicated tasks (make a wagon load itself with stones and move them to another location, etc.)."

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to lift an unwilling creature with telekinesis. The target is allowed a Will save to negate this effect, plus an additional Will save each round the effect is maintained. If a hostile lift is sustained with Sustained Force, it only lasts until the target succeeds at its save. A creature may suffer falling damage if they successfully save while floating high in the air."

    "bludgeon [core]": {
      "benefits": "Once per turn when lifting an object with telekinesis, you can spend its remaining movement to strike a creature or object within its square. When you use a lifted creature or object to strike another creature or object (moving the object into the target's square and ramming them), you must succeed at an attack roll using your base attack bonus plus your casting ability modifier against the target. On a successful hit, the target and the bludgeon take damage depending on the bludgeon's size. If the bludgeon is a weapon, the attack deals appropriate damage for that weapon (bolts and arrows are treated as daggers for this purpose). Since weapons are designed to deal damage, they do not suffer damage if used as a bludgeon.

    "deflect": {
      "benefits": "When you use the Catch function of your telekinesis, you may choose to simply deflect an incoming projectile or thrown object instead of catching it, causing it to simply miss instead of being lifted with telekinesis. Due to this briefer contact and more indirect force, the originator of the attack does not gain a Will save to negate the ability when you exercise this option."

      "benefits": "You may lift multiple targets at once (up to 1 + 1 per caster level) whose combined size does not exceed your maximum telekinesis size. You may treat these objects as one effective object for the purpose of bludgeoning a creature, or you may make multiple bludgeons per round (although you cannot make more attacks in a round than would otherwise be allowed with your BAB and any respective feats if you possess the Flair or Dancing Weapon talents). If you spend a spell point to use Hostile Lift or Sustained Force, it may apply it to as many of these objects as applicable. You may also spend a spell point when using the Steal, Telekinetic Maneuver, or Telekinetic Push talents to affect multiple targets at once (up to one additional target per 2 caster levels, minimum: 1), although you cannot affect an individual target more than once per round with any combat maneuver."

When performing a skill at a distance you may use your casting ability modifier in place of the normal ability modifier, but you also suffer a -5 penalty to the skill check.

    "gravity ward": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you can create a 5 ft radius emanation anywhere in your telekinesis range that resists entry as your telekinetic force attempts to push targets out. Entering the area requires a Will save, and a creature that fails its save must wait until their next turn to make another attempt.

    "gravity well": {
      "benefits": "You can create a compact point of telekinetic force that draws everything towards it as a standard action. Select a point within range of your telekinesis. When you first use this ability and each time you spend an action to concentrate on it, all unattended objects and creatures of up to your telekinesis limit within a 10 ft radius + 5 ft per five caster levels of that point are drawn in a straight line to the unoccupied space nearest to the center of the effect. Unwilling creatures are subjected to a drag combat maneuver that pulls them towards the center, using your caster level -5 plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. A creature in the area of this effect may attempt to escape it on its own turn by attempting the drag combat maneuver as a move action against a CMD equal to your caster level plus your casting ability modifier + 5, moving the indicated distance away from the center of the gravity well.

These natural weapon attacks use your casting attribute modifier instead of Strength for attack and damage and resolve as a magical force effect. You can spend one spell point to increase the duration to 1 minute per caster level. You may use sphere talents, magical effects, and class features with these natural attacks as though they are manufactured or natural weapons.

As a standard action, you may perform a bull rush, pull, reposition, trip, dirty maneuver, or grapple (upgrades to pin if the target is already grappled) combat maneuver against a target. Use your caster level -5 plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. If grappling, your CMD is your CMB +5 and the target is allowed to make a new Will save each round to negate the effect.

As a readied action, you may push a projectile, creature, thrown object, or another caster's bludgeon up to one size larger than your telekinesis limit. If aiding, you may increase a weapon's range increment by half your telekinesis speed and increase its effective size by 1 size category +1 per 5 caster levels for the purposes of dealing damage or determining if another caster may catch the object with their own telekinesis. If aiding a creature, you may choose to instead grant it an enhancement bonus to its movement equal to 1/2 your telekinesis speed. You may also add 1d6 damage + 1d6 per 5 caster levels to the falling damage a target suffers. This ability may be used to cause damage to a target that was successfully tripped. Alternately, you may slow down a creature or object, cutting its movement speed and damage in half. If the target is falling, this decreases their falling speed to 60 ft per round, allowing them to fall great distances without being hurt. Telekinetic pushes don't require a spell point even when used on hostile targets, but do allow a Will save to negate."

The target has its movement speeds halved (minimum 5 feet) and suffers a -1 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves (Will negates). This penalty increases by 1 per 10 caster levels you possess. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to increase its duration to 1 round per caster level without concentration.

With haste, you can grant them fast healing equal to 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels you possess for the duration of the effect. With slow, you can suspend the target's natural healing abilities, preventing any fast healing or regeneration they may possess for the duration of the effect. Magical or extraordinary healing from other sources continues to function as normal. A creature whose regeneration can't be suppressed or ignored (such as the tarrasque) is immune to this effect."

      "benefits": "When you use Haste on a target, that target may either make an additional attack at their highest base attack bonus when making a full attack, or make additional attacks of opportunity during the round (+1 attack of opportunity, +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess). The target may only benefit from one such benefit per round; if they make a full attack with a bonus attack, they do not gain additional attacks of opportunity that round. This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by the haste spell or a speed weapon, and taking a full attack with a bonus attack from such a source counts as choosing that option for Haste for that round."

If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created.

Each target must be within range and must be affected by the same alter time effect. Once created, each alter time effect is considered a separate sphere effect. Alternatively, you may spend an extra spell point to double the size of an alter time effect that targets an area."

      "benefits": "Your alter time effects gain a range of close. You may select this talent multiple times.

    "retroactive preparation": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to edit the past, retroactively obtaining a generic object worth less than 100 gp per caster level. The object immediately appears on your person or in a container or extradimensional space attended by you. The cost of the item is immediately deducted from the wealth (usually coins, but can be nonmagical gemstones or other nonmagical objects used for trade) you currently carry. You cannot obtain an object worth more than you have the wealth to purchase.

    "temporal trap": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to place an alter time effect onto an adjacent, unoccupied 5-ft. square. If the alter time effect normally requires you to spend 1 or more spell points, that cost is added to the cost to create a temporal trap. Any creature who steps onto the square activates the alter time effect; if it is normally a targeted ability, the creature is immediately affected by that ability, though they are allowed a saving throw as normal, if appropriate. If the alter time effect normally creates an area effect, the square itself is used as the center of that effect (even if it would normally be centered on the caster) and all creatures within the area are immediately affected by the ability, making saves as normal if appropriate. Any alter time effect with a duration longer than instantaneous lasts for 1 round per caster level, regardless of its normal duration, though you may dismiss it on your turn as a free action. You may only have 1 active temporal trap at a time; placing a second trap deactivates the first. Temporal traps may be made permanent with the permanency spell or ritual; permanent temporal traps do not count against your total number of active traps and automatically reset after their duration expires. When used with an ability that includes a variable cost, such as the Time Clone talent, the cost must be paid up front; if the cost is insufficient to affect the creature that triggers this effect, the trap is not activated. If the variable cost is greater than required to affect the triggering creature, the excess spell points are wasted but the trap and effect otherwise occur as normal. You may select this talent multiple times, increasing the number of temporal traps you may have active at once by 1 each time you do so."

This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also struck by the alter time effect. If using a scatter weapon, the effect only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack."

This effect radiates from a central point, and cannot extend through walls. You may choose to exclude yourself from the effect. \n Wall:  You may arrange your alter time as up to three 10-ft. cubes, +1 cube per caster level. You must be able to perceive all areas your alter time will inhabit. You must occupy a space in or adjacent to one of the cubes. You may imbue this area with a single alter time ability that targets creatures. You may not apply (time) talents that target areas. Creatures that enter or begin their turn in this area are affected as if targeted by an alter time ability that targets individual creatures. If leaving the area, the effects last until the start of the creature's next turn. If the alter time ability allows a saving throw, the creature must make it the first time each round it enters or begins its turn within the area. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to allow it to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration. Alter time abilities, such as haste, cannot be extended beyond this duration. If you possess the Ranged Time talent, the selected area may be anywhere with range and does not have to be centered on or adjacent to you, but the effect cannot extend beyond your Ranged Time range.

This grants the target concealment (20% miss chance) against attacks, +5% per 3 caster levels to a maximum of 50%. This is a blur effect, and may be counteracted by abilities that specify they can see through them. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore this penalty, although fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, although you may spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration."

    "age (time)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to increase or decrease a target's age by 1 category (unwilling creatures attempt a Fortitude save to negate). This adds or removes penalties to physical ability scores but does not add or remove bonuses to mental ability scores. You may move the target 1 age category older or younger, plus an additional category for every 5 caster levels possessed. This cannot cause the target to die of old age, nor become so young they were never born. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. The effects of different age categories are cumulative (thus, a target moved from young adult to venerable would suffer a -6 penalty to all physical ability scores).

Attended objects are permitted a Will save by their holder to negate this ability. Unless noted, the chosen effect persists for as long as you concentrate, or for 1 minute per caster level if you spend an additional spell point. Choose from the following effects: Restore:  As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point when targeting an object with the broken condition to restored it to the form it previously had, removing the broken condition. This does not restore any charges to limited use items nor restore expended single-use items. This option can also be used to counter or dispel the other applications of this talent with requiring a magic skill check. Spoilage:  As an instantaneous effect, you may cause an amount of food sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to spoil or cause an equal amount of spoiled food to return to a palatable state. This does not remove other changes made to the food, such as adding poison or magical effects unless you spend a spell point and succeed on a magic skill check against the poison or effect's DC. Restoring the food does not prevent future spoilage. Weather:  The object is shifted to its future state, reducing its hardness by your caster level."

    "broken time (time)": {
      "benefits": "You cause time to move at an unnatural pace around the target for as long as you concentrate, jumping and skipping in distorted shudders unless they succeed at a Will saving throw. Targets who fail their saving throw take a penalty on all skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level and must succeed on a concentration check against your MSD to cast a spell; failing this concentration check means the spell fails and the effort is wasted. You may spend a spell point to allow this effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration.

The delayed damage and/or effect is incurred at this time, though it is subject to any changes to immunity, resistances, etc. A given effect or instance of damage cannot be delayed more than once. Unwilling creatures and objects attended by unwilling creatures require a successful touch attack and are allowed a Will save to negate this delay. If you spend an additional spell point as part of using this ability, you may partially delay ability damage, ability drain, and hit point damage further, causing the creature to receive half (round up) of the damage or drain at the end of its next turn and the remainder at the end of the following turn."

    "eject (time)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to attempt to eject a creature from time itself for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). The creature disappears completely and cannot be the target of any damage or effect while it is vanished. When the effect ends, the creature returns in the exact spot it disappeared from (or the closest unoccupied square). From the target's perspective no time has passed, and any effect already on the target with a duration (such as magic or poison) continues as if the time spent ejected simply had not happened.

Targets who are already fatigued or exhausted fall asleep. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens a sleeping creature, but normal noise does not.

This allows the target to take 20 on a single Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check without increasing the time required to perform the action, even if stress or distractions would normally prevent the target from taking 10 or taking 20. This may only be used on skill checks that take no more than 1 round to perform and begin within one round of this effect being cast. If using this ability on yourself and only yourself, you may use this ability as a swift action.

The target may perform the same actions again (remaking any rolls required by such actions), or they may choose completely different actions. If you choose to redo your own turn in this manner, you do not recover the action or spell points spent using this ability. Author's Note:  This talent affects the current creature's turn, and cannot \"reset or rewind\" the round or the turn of a creature whose turn has already concluded. The Retry talent has no effects when targeting a creature who is not the \"active turn\" in initiative. Use of the Retry talent outside of combat should be done at GM discretion (allowing the talent to function normally, but no more than what could normally be undone in a single \"turn\", but there is not generally an initiative tracker outside of combat)"

    "shift time (time)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to grant the target the ability to immediately take a standard, move, or swift action if they choose. Any target who takes an action with this ability loses that action for their next turn. You may use this ability on yourself and only yourself as a swift action, or a free action if you choose to take a swift action with this ability. You cannot use this ability as a swift or free action in this manner if combining it with the Mass Time talent. A creature cannot benefit from Shift Time more than once per round."

If successful, you immediately gain an additional standard action. An individual target cannot suffer the effects of this ability more than once per round. Even if you successfully target multiple creatures in the same round with this ability (such as through the Mass Time talent), you cannot gain more than a single standard action in a round in this manner, nor can you use this new standard action to activate this talent an additional time by any means."

    "stretch time (time)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to decelerate time within a 10-foot radius burst, +5 feet per 5 caster levels. All effects that are active within this area or on a creature within this area have their duration extended by 1 round per caster level, to a maximum extended duration of twice the effect's normal duration (so an effect that normally only lasts for 1 round could not be extended in this manner for more than 1 additional round). This affects magic (spells, sphere abilities, etc.), poisons, diseases, etc., but does not prevent creatures within the area from taking actions as normal. In the case of effects that target areas, only the portion of the effect contained within Stretch Time's area is decelerated. Unwilling targets (including allies if they so choose) are allowed a Will save to negate this effect for themselves or area effects originating from them. You can choose whether or not to affect yourself with your own stretch time. Stretch Time counters the effects of Fast Time within its affected area and vice versa."

    "time bubble (time)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to create a bubble of distorted time around yourself that extends outward in a 15-ft. radius sphere, +5 ft. per 5 caster levels you possess. This sphere lasts for 1 round per caster level and moves with you, remaining centered around you at all times. Time passing within this sphere moves at a different rate than time outside, granting all creatures within the sphere partial concealment from attacks originating from outside the sphere. If a creature occupies a space both within the sphere and without (such as a Large or larger creature), creatures within the sphere do not gain partial concealment against its attacks, but the creature takes 1d8 damage per two caster levels as its body is torn apart by conflicting temporal forces. This damage occurs when the creature first enters the spaces within and without the time bubble, and at the start of their turn each round they remain within the affected area. Creatures cannot be damaged by this effect more than once per round. You may spend an additional spell point when you create this sphere to apply the effects of the haste or slow abilities (including the effects from Improved Haste or Improved Slow) to all creatures within the sphere's affected area; you may choose at the time of casting whether or not to subject yourself to these additional effects."

    "time freeze (time)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend one spell point to freeze all activity within a 10-foot radius burst, + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. If used as a readied action, this can stop ranged attacks or instantaneous magical effects (such as destructive blasts), but in the case of effects that target areas, only the effect contained within the Time Freeze's area is stopped. Unwilling targets (including allies if they choose) are allowed a Will save to negate this effect for themselves or effects originating from them (attacks, magic, etc.). You can choose whether or not to affect yourself with your own time freeze. All affected objects and creatures within this area cannot act for 1 round, neither can they be acted upon (moved, dealt damage to, etc.). Once the effect is in place, non-affected creatures can enter the area of effect without incident, so long as they do not disturb an affected creature or object. After one round has passed, everything within the area is unfrozen; creatures resume moving, ranged attacks hit the square they were targeting, and blast effects resolve as normal."

    "time of the season (time) [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "You create a temporal bubble which changes the season. Create a sphere with a radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels centered on a creature, object, or square within reach (or within your Time sphere range, if you possess the Ranged Time talent) and choose one of the following seasons: Spring:  The area becomes a refreshing spring. Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make this area burst with overgrowth. If you do, the area becomes difficult terrain (effects which allow a creature to move normally in natural terrain, such as woodland stride, ignore this difficult terrain). Summer:  The area becomes a warm summer. Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make this area cause heatstroke. If you do, creatures that enter this area or are inside this area at the end of your turn must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 nonlethal damage and are fatigued until they recover from this nonlethal damage. Autumn:  The area becomes a tranquil autumn. Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make this area filled with rustling leaves and a calming rustic scent. If you do, creatures that enter this area or are inside this area at the end of your turn must succeed at a Will save or be fascinated as long as they remain in this area. This is a mind-affecting effect, and creatures who save against this effect cannot be fascinated by this sphere effect for 24 hours. Winter:  The area becomes a frosty winter. Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make the area filled with a miniature snowstorm. If you do, the snowstorm obscures all sight in this area, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment and creatures farther away have total concealment. An unwilling creature targeted by this effect can attempt a Will save to negate this effect, and is granted a new saving throw each round as a free action. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. Special:  Weather conditions inside this effect's area are treated as severity 1, generally matching the selected season (winter: Cold 1, spring: Heat 1, summer: Heat 1, fall: Cold 1), allowing creatures inside the effect's radius to ignore current weather conditions. Time Of The Season counts as an opposed control weather effect, and changing the weather in an area that includes Time Of The Season's area of effect is treated as opposed casters affecting the same weather category. If Time Of The Season's caster is successful when making a magic skill check in this manner, or an opposed caster is unsuccessful, the weather inside Time Of The Season's area of effect is treated as severity 0. If Time Of The Season's caster is unsuccessful, or an opposed caster is successful, the weather within Time Of The Season's area is unaffected and any season's additional effects (such as spring's overgrowth or summer's intensified heat) are suppressed."

    "advanced rewind": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere (Age (time)), caster level 10th. You may use the Age (time) talent to not only alter the age of creatures or objects, but also enchantments. By spending two spell points and succeeding at a magic skill check against the enchantment's magic skill defence, you may rewind an enchantment on a creature or object to before it was placed, removing it from the target. This cannot be used to reverse instantaneous effects such as damage, but can be used to remove permanent enchantments. If successfully used on a magic item this renders the object non-magical. This has no effect on artifacts, but can be used to target area spells. Permanent constructs are treated as creatures for this effect; you can rewind an enchantment off of a construct, but cannot rewind the enchantment that gave life to the construct itself."

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere (Eject (time)), caster level 17th. You may spend 5 spell points to touch a target and attempt to permanently eject a creature from the space-time continuum unless they succeed on a Will saving throw. The subject remains there in a state of suspended animation unless a freedom spell or Reclamation is cast at the locale where the ejection took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or other similar divinations (including most effects from the Divination sphere) does not reveal the fact that a creature is ejected, but the discern location spell or advanced talent does. A miracle or wish spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it has been ejected. Reclamation:  In addition to ejecting someone from the space-time continuum, you may also spend 5 spell points to return a creature ejected from the space-time continuum. This ability must be used at the location where the target was first ejected. This talent may also be used to free a creature from the effects of an imprisonment or maze spell, and can be used to instantly dispel any ongoing effect created by the Time sphere, such as a Slow effect, Time Bubble, or Time Clone."

    "past sight": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere, caster level 5th. You peer not only through space, but through time. You may spend one minute and a spell point to view the past of your present location out to close range, viewing the past hour. You gain full sensory information based on the senses you possess. You may concentrate on this effect, viewing an additional hour further in the past for each minute of concentration. You are considered flat-footed while concentrating on this effect. If you possess the Mass Time talent, you may share this sight with a number of willing creatures within your alter time range as defined by that talent. Such creatures are also flat-footed for the duration, though they may choose to exit the vision at any time. If you possess the Ranged Time talent, you increase the area you may view by one step per time it is taken (close to medium, medium to long). If Ranged Time is taken three times, your viewing area increases to line of sight. At caster level 8th, you may spend an extra spell point to view days instead of hours, each day requiring 10 minutes. At caster level 16th, you may spend 2 additional spell points to view years instead of hours, each year requiring 1 hour."

This future self can be up to 1 hour per caster level into the future. You may ask a future self a single short question, receiving a short, concise answer if your future self is able. You may concentrate on this effect, asking a different future self a different question each round. If the answer must be longer than a few words, your future self may reply over multiple rounds as long as you maintain concentration. While your future self usually gives honest and accurate information, your new knowledge of events may change the outcome, and therefore render the advice of your future self obsolete at the GMs judgement (such as the case of outcomes tied to random chance, in which case the GM should roll a dice to roughly approximate the chance of success when determining whether a successful or not version of yourself was contacted). Any given question has a 10% chance that no future self will respond. This result is identical to if you try to contact a version of yourself that is dead as a result of the course of action you specified."

    "reversion": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere, caster level 10th. You gain the ability to allow a character to completely retrain the last class level they gained by returning them to an earlier point in time. You must spend 10 spell points and remain in physical contact with the target for 1 minute, at the end of which they may immediately retrain the last class level they gained, choosing a new class, feats, spells, skills, or other class options as appropriate. The target of this ability must still rest to regain any bardic performance rounds, rage rounds, spell points, spell slots, or other limited use abilities granted by this new class level."
    },
    "reversion, complete": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere (Reversion (advanced)), caster level 15th. When using the Reversion talent, you may allow the target to retrain any and all class levels they possess, choosing a new class, feats, spells, skills, or other class options as appropriate. The target of this ability cannot immediately use limited-use powers gained in this fashion that it did not previously have, and must rest to regain any bardic performance rounds, rage rounds, spell points, spell slots, or other limited use abilities granted by these new class levels. Reversion and Complete Reversion The Reversion and Complete Reversion talents presented here offer some very flexible options for players in that they both allow for rapid retraining in the event that a player grows dissatisfied with their character, and in that it allows a character to swap to a different build during a short rest (albeit at some expense of character daily resources). While these abilities can be both interesting and useful, they also have the potential to severely impact play at the table if they are not managed wisely. We strongly encourage any character planning on using Reversion or Complete Reversion during play (such as to change from a Symbiat (Chronomancer) to a Fighter (Fracture) when confronted with an opponent who is immune to magic) to have their alternate build put together before they sit down at the table so that they are not trying to rebuild a character while the rest of the party is trying to move forward with the story. We also encourage players planning to use this ability on themselves to choose alternate builds that still have access to a spell point pool and the Reversion or Complete Reversion talents in the event they find they enjoyed their previous build more; once a character has trained away their ability to use these talents, they may find that they cannot easily access them again."

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere, caster level 15th. You may touch a target and spend 3 spell points to place it into a state of suspended animation (Fortitude negates). For the creature, time ceases to flow and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. When placing this effect on a creature, you may choose to either place the target into stasis permanently or to set either a time limit or a condition on the ability. When the time limit expires or the condition is met, the temporal stasis ends. Temporal Stasis may be dispelled."

    "time clone (time)": {
      "benefits": "You draw a version of the target from an alternate timeline to assist you on the battlefield by spending a number of spell points equal to 1/2 the target's total Hit Dice (minimum 1). Activating this ability informs the caster of how many spell points it will cost for their intended target; if they do not have enough spell points, the action is wasted but no spell points are spent. This copy lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level and appears in a square adjacent to the target and acts immediately on your turn, moving and acting as you direct it (a free action). The copy shares all of the target's statistics (including current spell points after the talent is used and other limited-use abilities), movement speeds, and abilities, including equipped items (but not consumable or limited use items such as potions, wands, and scrolls), but its tether to this timeline is tenuous and the copy instantly vanishes if it takes any damage or fails a saving throw against any spell or effect. Any items the time clone may have possessed instantly disappear when the target is destroyed or when the duration of this effect ends. You must succeed on a melee touch attack (or a ranged touch attack if you possess the Ranged Time talent) to use this ability on an unwilling target, and they are allowed a Will saving throw against this effect; on a successful saving throw this ability fails and any spell points spent on it are wasted. Time clones created with this talent cannot create additional time clones or similar copies of themselves."

You create a sphere with a radius up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. This effect remains centered around you as you move. You may spend 1 spell point to allow this effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration. If you possess the Ranged Time talent, you may choose to center this effect on a square within your Time sphere range, and if you do, can include yourself when choosing flow or tumble. When you first cast this effect and at the start of your turn each round, choose flow or tumble: Flow:  You may allow any number of creatures (excluding yourself) inside this effect's radius to take a 5-foot step, provided they do not move outside this effect's radius. This movement does not count against a creature's ability to take a 5-foot step during their turn. At caster level 10th, creatures granted a 5-foot step by this effect may move up to 10 feet instead. \n Tumble (requires Warp sphere):  You may teleport 1 creature + 1 creature per 10 caster levels (excluding yourself) inside this effect's radius to another unoccupied, open area inside the effect's radius (Will negates). If you possess the Warp sphere Unwilling Teleport talent, you can attempt to shift creatures into locations that would be directly harmful to that creature as though using the Unwilling Teleport talent, but those creatures gain a +4 bonus on their saving throw to resist being teleported.

You cannot choose a season's additional effects if you adjust the weather inside Time Of The Season's area. If you spend a spell point to allow Time Of The Season to continue without concentration, any weather severity changes you made continue for Time Of The Season's duration. Note:  Changes to weather inside the area of effect should generally match a season's normal weather, such as winter having Cold and snow and summer having Heat, subject to GM discretion. Generally speaking, wind is appropriate in any climate, but Cold, Heat, Precipitation, and Aridity will vary by season, or whatever may be appropriate for that region. Suggested weather conditions (for each season): \n Winter:  Cold, Precipitation. \n Spring:  Heat, Precipitation. \n Summer:  Heat, Aridity. \n Fall:  Cold, Aridity."

    "pawstpone [catgirl hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere, caster level 5th. Benefits:  Whenever you cast a sphere effect, you may instead delay the sphere effect and create a temporal mote attached to either the targets of the spell or the targeted square or grid intersection. All targets and variables for the sphere effect must be chosen when the effect is delayed. You cannot choose to concentrate on a delayed sphere effect and must choose to spend an additional spell point to maintain the sphere effect when the effect is first delayed. A temporal mote lasts for a number of rounds up to your Time sphere caster level (minimum 1), chosen when created; if you spend 1 additional spell point, this duration increases up to 1 minute per caster level. Temporal motes emit a magical aura matching the delayed sphere effect's aura and you may choose to have the temporal mote be regularly visible or hidden like a trap (Perception DC 10 + your Time sphere caster level). When the temporal mote's duration ends, the sphere effect occurs normally, affecting each target or the targeted area. A temporal mote can be dispelled, causing the delayed effect to also dispelled in its entirety. You may spend a standard action to end the duration of any number of temporal motes early; these temporal motes must have all been created as part of the same sphere effect (such as multiple temporal motes created from a delayed enhance effect with Mass Enhance). The maximum number of sphere effects you may delay with this talent is equal to your casting ability modifier (minimum 1). A sphere effect which creates multiple temporal motes (such as an enhance with Mass Enhancement) is treated as a single sphere effect for the purposes of this limit, but may trigger or be dispelled separately. When creating one or more temporal motes with this ability, you may give each mote conditions to activate (as though using the Contingency feat). If multiple motes would be created as part of casting the same sphere effect, you may give each temporal mote a different set of conditions. A temporal mote with conditions cannot have their duration ended early as part of a standard action. Example:  Meowlin is a mischievous prankster. He casts a delayed telekinesis effect modified with Divided Mind, targeting a number of vases and other fragile items in his owner's home. Meowlin decides to have the temporal motes last 12 rounds, rather than the full 18 rounds equal to his Time sphere caster level, and gives each one a trigger to \"bonk Jennifer when she walks into the kitchen\". 1 minute later (10 rounds), Jennifer walks into the kitchen and the temporal motes trigger, causing the multiple objects to fly off the shelves and \"bonk\" her, behaving as a Bludgeon (although no more Bludgeons than normally capable with Divided Mind). If Meowlin spent an additional spell point to use sustained force on the objects, they would continue to be under his telekinesis. Otherwise, the objects will fall after completing their trigger."

If the caster does not have enough spell points, he is instead dazed until the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 38 \n The next time the caster sleeps, he requires twice the amount of time to receive the normal benefits of the rest. \n \n \n 39 \n (Combat) The caster is nauseated for 1 round. \n \n \n 40 \n For 1 round per caster level, the caster stutters rapidly through time, imposing a 50% miss chance on all attacks made by or targeting him. Additionally, all effects originating from or including the caster that do not have an attack roll suffer a 50% failure chance. \n \n \n 41 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, for hostile creatures, all squares within close range of the caster cost double the normal movement cost and 5-foot steps are impossible. \n \n \n 42 \n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \n \n \n 43 \n The caster is exhausted. \n \n \n 44 \n All allied creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be slowed for 1d6 rounds. \n \n \n 45 \n All creatures within close range of the caster take a 5 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 caster level penalty to all movement speeds for 10 minutes per caster level.

    "haste [core]": {
      "benefits": "You grant the target the ability to make an extra attack at its highest BAB whenever it makes a full attack action. This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so it cannot be used to cast a second sphere effect or otherwise take an extra action in the round. The Chronomancer's Handbook \n$4.99 You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to allow it to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration. When using the haste ability, you may choose to grant the target an extra attack of opportunity instead of an extra attack on their full attack actions. For every 5 caster levels you possess, you grant the target one additional attack of opportunity. All other costs and restrictions of the haste ability apply as normal."

      "benefits": "You cause the target to become staggered, allowing it to only take a single move action or standard action on its turn, but not both (Will negates). You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to increase its duration to 1 round per caster level without concentration. If a slow and haste ability are used on the same creature, the second caster must pass a magic skill check. On a failure the target is unaffected. On a success, the effects counter each other, leaving neither in place. When using the slow ability, you may choose to prevent the target from making attacks of opportunity for the duration of the effect instead of causing them to be staggered. All other costs and restrictions of the slow ability apply as normal. Some Time talents are marked (time). These talents grant you additional alter time abilities. Time Sphere Talents"

      "benefits": "You may touch an object, aging or restoring it. Attended objects are permitted a Will save to negate this ability. Unless noted, the chosen effect persists for as long as you concentrate, or for 1 minute per caster level if you spend an additional spell point. Applications with a duration may be dismissed as an immediate action. Choose from the following effects: Restore  - As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point when targeting an object with the broken condition to restored it to the form it previously had, removing the broken condition. This does not restore any charges to limited use items nor restore expended alchemical items. This option can also be used to counter or dispel the other applications of this talent with requiring a magic skill check. \n Rewind Enchantment  - You return the object to the state it was in before it was enchanted. Make a magic skill check against the item's magic skill defense. If successful, the object becomes non-magical. This has no effect on artifacts. \n Spoilage  - As an instantaneous effect, you may cause an amount of food sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to spoil or cause an equal amount of spoiled food to return to a palatable state. This does not remove other changes made to the food, such as adding poison or magical effects unless you spend a spell point and succeed on a magic skill check against the poison or effect's DC. Restoring the food does not prevent future spoilage. \n Weather  - The object if shifted to its future state, reducing its hardness by your caster level. If you possess the Group Time talent, you may target multiple objects, but the same effect must be applied to each."

The delayed damage and/or effect is incurred with at this time, though is subject to any changes to immunity, resistances, etc. A given effect or instance of damage cannot be delayed more than once. Unwilling creatures and objects attended by unwilling creatures require a successful touch attack and are allowed a Will save to negate this delay.

      "benefits": "You may activate this power as a swift action to store actions for future use for the next three rounds, or as long as you concentrate; you may alternatively spend an additional spell point to maintain this effect for 1 round per caster level. On your turn, you may expend a standard, move, or swift action. Before the end of your next turn, you gain an extra action of the stored type as a free action. Stored standard actions may be used for either move or standard actions as normal. Unspent actions are lost at the end of your next turn. If you spend a spell point as part of activating this talent, you may store the action for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier (minimum 2 rounds). You may touch a willing creature as a free action on your turn to grant the stored action to that creature. Ranged Time increases the distance at which this transfer functions.

This is a blur effect, and may be counteracted by abilities that specify they can see through them.

You may move the target 1 age category older or younger, plus an additional category for every 5 caster levels possessed. This cannot cause the target to die of old age, nor become so young they were never born. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.

      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to attempt to eject a target from time itself for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). The target disappears completely and cannot be the target of any damage or effect while it is vanished. When the effect ends, the target returns in the exact spot it disappeared from (or the closest unoccupied square).

This may only be used on skill checks that take no more than 1 round to perform. If using this ability on yourself and only yourself, you may use this ability as a swift action.

This affects magic (spells, sphere abilities, etc.) poisons, diseases, etc., but does not prevent creatures within the area from taking actions as normal. In the case of effects that target areas, only the portion of the effect contained within slow time's area is decelerated. Unwilling targets (including allies if they so choose) are allowed a Will save to negate this effect for themselves or area effects originating from them.

Some rallies can be used in response to other events, in which case the rally occurs before the triggering event completes, unless noted otherwise. Rallies that work from triggers can only be used when that trigger occurs, and can only affect those allies that the trigger applies to. When you gain the War sphere, you gain the following rally:"
    },
    "commanding aid": {
      "benefits": "You may use the aid another action on the target. You must use your caster level + your casting ability modifier in place of your melee attack bonus for this purpose, and may aid them against any creature also within range of your rally. War Talent Types Talents marked (totem) grant you new totems. Talents marked (rally) grant you additional rallies."
    },
    "mandate": {
      "benefits": "Talents marked (mandate) grant you ways of creating mandates. Mandates are effects that exist between a pair of allies, each of whom benefits from the actions of the other. As a standard action, you can create a mandate between two allies within medium range, one of whom may be yourself. You may concentrate to maintain a mandate, or can spend a spell point to make it last 1 minute per level without concentration. A mandate only works while the two sharing the mandate are within medium range of each other, and both are conscious and able to act. A creature can be part of multiple mandates with the same or different creatures, but cannot be a member of the same mandate type talent multiple times. Bonuses granted last until the end of the next turn of the ally who received the bonus. The advantage of a mandate can be triggered over and over again, though it does not stack with itself."
    },
    "momentum": {
      "benefits": "Talents marked (momentum) grant you a momentum pool, as well as a method of using it. If you have at least one (momentum) talent, you can spend a spell point as a standard action to gain a momentum pool. This pool lasts 1 hour per caster level, and holds a number of points of momentum equal to the War caster's caster level plus their casting ability modifier. Using this ability again refills your momentum pool; it does not create additional pools. Allies within 30 feet of you can spend points of momentum from this pool to activate any ability from any of your (momentum) talents (using a (momentum) talent spends momentum points, not spell points). All of your (momentum) talents draw from the same pool, and using momentum is not considered a sphere ability and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The caster level associated with the momentum pools is that of the caster when they last filled their pool. Being knocked unconscious or made helpless makes the momentum pool inaccessible until you are conscious again. War Talents"

    "bleeding battlefield": {
      "benefits": "When you create a totem, enemies within your totem can't heal naturally, and fast healing and regeneration are halved. Multiple totems do not reduce the healing further. Magical healing works normally."
    },
    "blood bond": {
      "benefits": "When you create a mandate and spend a spell point to maintain it without concentration, the mandate lasts for 10 minutes per caster level rather than 1 minute per caster level. If you are a member of the mandate, it instead lasts 1 hour per caster level."

      "benefits": "You may create totems attached to yourself or to other creatures. A totem attached to a creature is called a totemic aura.

They continue to function if they go beyond long range of their creator, but the creator can only rally those within that totem (including the creature it is attached to) if they are within long range. The recipient must be within range (adjacent to you, or in close range if you possess the Ranged Totem talent). An unwilling creature can have a totem attached to them as a touch attack; no saving throw is allowed, but the Break Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or a similar effect effect can dispel the totem before its natural duration expires. An enemy with a totem attached to them still receives any saving throws the totem allows to avoid being affected. A successful save means they are unaffected by the totem, but it remains attached to them and it still affects those within range of it. Spell resistance can prevent a totemic aura from being attached to a creature. A failed spell penetration check dispels the totem."
    },
    "totemic emblem": {
      "benefits": "You may create totems attached to objects. A totem attached to an object is called a totemic emblem. This functions as a regular totem, except that it has a radius of 30 feet, it moves with the object it is attached to, and is dispelled if the object is destroyed. totemic emblems continue to function if they go beyond long range of their creator, but the creator can only rally those within that totem if they are within long range. The recipient object must be within range (adjacent to you, or in close range if you possess the Ranged Totem talent). An unwilling creature can have a totem attached to its equipment as a touch attack; no saving throw is allowed, but the Break Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or a similar effect can dispel the totem before its natural duration expires. An object with a totem attached to it still receives any saving throws the totem allows to avoid being affected. A successful save means it is unaffected by the totem, but it remains attached to it and it still affects those within range of the totem. Spell resistance can prevent a totemic emblem from being attached to an object. Failing to bypass the intended target's spell resistance in attempting to attach the totem dispels the totem.

If you gain this talent three times, a creature who comes into contact with your totem of doom who is already frightened from another effect becomes panicked. Multiple totems of doom do not stack with each other for this purpose."

    "totem of expulsion (totem)": {
      "benefits": "You must spend a spell point to create a totem of expulsion. The totem creates a field of energy that applies interdimensional pressure to creatures that do not belong on your plane, and weakens them. All non-native outsiders (including allies) within are sickened (no save) while they remain inside the area of the totem. In addition, they receive a penalty to any damage reduction, energy resistance, and spell resistance they possess equal to your caster level. Energy immunity is also affected: treat immune creatures as having a resistance equal to twice their total Hit Dice, then subtract your caster level asyou would with normal resistance, to a minimum of 0. You can only create this totem on your home plane."

      "benefits": "You must spend a spell point to create a totem of insanity. Enemies within this totem are filled with bloodlust and confusion, and must make a Will save upon entering the area of the totem or upon it being created. If they fail, then on the beginning of their next turn there is a 50% chance they will attack their own nearest ally instead of their enemy. If they do, they are considered an ally for the purposes of your totems for the duration of the attack. At the end of any turn they do this, they receive another saving throw. Leaving the totem causes the effect to end for a creature, but re-entering it causes the effect to resume if they have not yet made a successful saving throw. The effects of this totem are a mind-affecting, compulsion effect."

    },
    "totem of screaming skin (totem)": {
      "benefits": "You must spend a spell point to create a totem of screaming skin. Enemies within this are haunted by the sensation of a pain from far away. Whenever their skin is even slightly broken, a wound rips open in the shape of a mouth and screams, making even the smallest injuries horrific. Whenever a weapon or natural weapon attack is made on an enemy inside the totem, if the attack roll misses by 5 or less, and is not a natural 1, the attack is a glancing blow and does damage equal to your caster level. Effects that trigger on a hit, such as a melee touch attack delivering a sphere ability, do not trigger on a glancing blow."

    "totem of shared sight (totem)": {
      "benefits": "You and your allies can share perception, seeing through each other's eyes and hearing through each other ears. Anything visible or noticed by one is also perceived by everyone else, including with special senses such as blindsense or scent. This can prevent a character from being surprised. If any ally within the totem successfully saves versus an illusion effect, then everyone else automatically passes their saving throw as well, even if they previously failed.

The giving character can not move (or take a 5-ft. step), while the receiving ally gets another move action to spend. This extra move action must be used immediately and can only be used with a movement ability. They may not leave the area of the totem during this move. Their actions provoke attacks of opportunity normally. No single ally can be moved by more than 2 allies until their next turn has occurred. Any ally may swap places with an adjacent ally as a move action. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Both allies must be capable of moving for this to work."
    },
    "totem of whispers (totem)": {
      "benefits": "The area of your totem is filled with quiet voices that distract and unnerve your enemies. Enemies take a -1 penalty to their concentration checks and Perception checks involving listening. This increases by -1 for every 2 caster levels you possess. This does not work against deaf enemies, or enemies in an environment where it is difficult to hear. The whispers also interfere with using abilities that require speaking - such an ability has a 20% chance of failing when used, even if the user is deaf. Whenever a creature uses such an ability, they can attempt a Perform (oratory) or similar Perform check with a DC of 20 to negate this effect."

The object can not be animated, and can not become animated without dispelling the totem first. The range of the totem increases to 1 mile per caster level, and it remains for one day per caster level. Multiple totems may be attached to the same monument. The owner of a monument does not need to stay within range of it to maintain it, and they can share ownership with allies, allowing those allies to use it to rally their own allies. When created, the creator must specify an easily perceived condition by which allies of the monument will be identified, such as their race, uniform or equipment. Creating a monument takes 8 hours."

You can spend 5 points from your stamina pool to create a 30-foot aura that moves with you and that duplicates the effects of this totem. The action required to activate this ability depends on the totem. If the totem has no spell point cost, it is a swift action to create it, if the totem requires a spell point to be created, then activating it is a move action, and if it requires more than 1 spell point, it requires a standard action. For the purposes of the totem ability, use your base attack bonus in place of your caster level and use your highest mental ability modifier as your casting ability modifier, if you do not already possess a casting tradition. The aura created is not a true totem, and does not qualify for feats that alter totems. Once activated, the aura remains active for 1 minute. Falling unconscious or dying causes the aura to end. This is an extraordinary ability."

For purposes of this mandate, the attribute that governs the maximum amount of grit, panache or luck you can possess is your casting ability and your base attack bonus is your caster level. The mandate lasts for one minute, or ends immediately if you create another mandate with this ability, fall unconscious, or if you move beyond 60 feet from each other.

Any creature within 100 feet per caster level that can see the light is affected by your totem, even if they are seeing the totem indirectly. For enemies, it is trivial to avert their eyes (so they can choose to simply not be affected by the totem), but any ally with a line of sight to the spirit beacon can easily keep it in view."

Faded creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight. They may still fall, and take double normal falling damage while the surface they fall onto takes none. Faded creatures suffer a penalty equal to your caster level to their Strength score (to a minimum Strength of 1) when determining their CMB, CMD, as well as their ability to lift, break or otherwise manipulate objects around them."

The tribal mark works as an enhancement, using your Enhancement caster level. If used on a creature, the creature is treated as if being within the totem that is the basis for the enhancement. If used on an object, then any creature carrying the object is affected as if they were the target of the enhancement themselves. Only the creature enhanced or carrying the enhanced object is considered inside the totem for effects that require another ally or an enemy to also be within the totem. The enhancement can not be used to rally."

As long as the song continues, the character may maintain the totem as part of the song without concentration or spending spell points, but must still pay any regular spell point cost to create the totem. Allies affected by a totem attached to a song can be rallied. In the case of a raging song, the ally need only have the choice to be affected; they do not need to choose to be affected in order for the caster to be able to rally them. Whenever the character creates a new totem, they may attach it to their song or create it normally. Totems attached to songs can be ended as a free action. If the character has the ability to move totems, they may attach and detach totems from their song as if the totems were totemic auras attached to themselves.

Only one ally (other than yourself) can benefit from your judgments this way. Squadron Feats Based around the use of the Squadron Commander feat, these feats offer various ways for allies to help each other - unlike teamwork feats, however, only one person in the party needs to know the feat being used. Similar to the Mana sphere, many Squadron feats offer potent supportive abilities to a wide variety of creatures, including those which would not otherwise be able to make significant contributions to an encounter. Thus, Squadron feats cannot be selected by animal companions, Conjuration companions, familiars, or other subordinate creatures. Author's Note:  Unless noted otherwise, you must have line of sight to use Squadron feats (and members must generally have line of sight to benefit each other). This means that you can use them over things like scrying and that their range is otherwise unlimited, but obstacles like opaque clouds can stop them."

      "benefits": "All creatures within the area of this totem suffer a -1 penalty to saving throws made to resist channeled negative energy and negative energy effects such as inflict spells and Death sphere effects. This penalty increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels. If you place an unhallowed totem in a location that already has a hallowed totem present, you must succeed at a magic skill check to place your totem. On a success, the two totems cancel each other, leaving neither hallowed totem nor unhallowed totem in place. Old War Feats Click the header above to visit the Sphere-Focused Feats page.

    "the channeler": {
      "benefits": "Casters with strong energy channeling features such as the cleric or  soul weaver  will think about picking up choices that offer new ways to use their channeling power. The hallowed and unhallowed totems have good synergy with channel energy, and are free to cast, and the giving and taking totems are also good if the channeler can acquire the other spheres that are prerequisites.  Channel Resolve  can also provide a powerful alternative use for their energy channeling."

    "the general": {
      "benefits": "The general wants to drop totems as often as possible. With the large size of totems, they don't worry about needing to get into battle, and instead concentrate their resources on getting more totems in play with talents like Call to Arms (possibly multiple times) and on moving totems with Redeployment. They are effectively force multipliers, and benefit from having as many allies as possible to enhance. When they don't, they resort to totems that weaken their enemies instead. These also increase in usefulness as the number of enemies grows. They are least useful in smaller fights, and might need to supplement their totems with rallies, mandates, and momentums."
    },
    "the interceptor": {
      "benefits": "The interceptor is a highly mobile fighter with casting ability who uses rallies to respond to events. They often possess a form of vigilance that allows them easy rallying such as the Eternal Vigilance talent, and have ways of rallying multiple allies, such as with Greater Rally. They are especially adept at rallying themselves, such as with Resounding Rally, and have extra resources to do so like  Reflexive Magic  and have abilities that trigger from them being rallied. Interceptors are more likely to use totemic auras so they can enhance themselves and nearby allies."
    },
    "the master": {
      "benefits": "War casters make allies stronger, so it's not surprising that an effective tactic is to have an ally with you at all times who can be on the receiving end of your helpful spells. One of the best ways to do that is to have a conjured companion or to have a battle-capable companion through your class features (such as druids and hunters do). Mandates can be extremely useful to this kind of caster if they don't want to invest heavily in the War sphere or have a low caster level. The  Battlefield Strategist drawback  can exchange the base totem with a mandate of your choice, and the Blood Bond talent can give you an all-day duration on your ally. With a shared mandate in place, you can target your rallies on them without a totem."
    },
    "the vanguard": {
      "benefits": "The vanguard is a melee combatant as well as a caster. Often, they are heavily armored with a high base attack bonus and a lower caster level. Many will take the Martial Magic feat. The vanguard attempts to empower themselves and nearby allies, or lay down controller effects by attaching totems to themselves with Totemic Presence. They use their swift actions to create totems while using full-round actions to attack. They will often possess several costless totems to activate when they have swift actions to spare, plus a few momentums they can prepare outside of battle. Vanguards are the warcasters most likely to multiclass into non-caster classes, and will often have extremely limited spell points. The  Strenuous drawback  can be of help with this if they are willing to sacrifice rallies, the  Totemic Stamina feat  is suitable for some martial classes, and the  Squadron Elite drawback  for the War sphere is suitable for them."

    "distortion aura [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "When you use a (space) talent which affects an area (such as Dimensional Lock, Flex Space, or Looped Space), you may choose to change the affected area to a 10-foot radius around you. This radius may be increased by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels you possess and follows you when you move. If you move so that a creature enters the aura, they are affected as if they had entered the area themself."
    },
    "emergency teleport": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to perform a teleport as an immediate action. The range is decreased to 5 feet per 2 caster levels (minimum 5 feet) and cannot be coupled with talents that would increase its range. If used to avoid an attack or area effect (or to move the attacker), this grants the defender evasion and a dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves equal to half your caster level (minimum 1). You cannot touch a target as part of this teleport, but you may affect another creature if you are already touching them."
    },
    "imbue teleport": {
      "benefits": "When you would teleport a target, you may imbue them with the ability to teleport instead of immediately teleporting them. The imbued target gains the ability to teleport themself once with the same details (such as caster level, talents, spell point expenditures) as you used with the original casting. However, the target may only teleport themselves and not others. The imbued teleport remains for 1 hour per caster level, or until used once. You may maintain one imbued teleport at a time, plus an additional imbued teleport for each five caster levels you possess."
    },
    "instill teleport [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may spend a spell point to touch a small container of liquid and instill a teleport or bend space that affects a single target inside it, which functions as a potion or oil. The instilled effect cannot have a trigger/normally require an immediate or readied action to activate, nor have a duration of concentration. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "isoport": {
      "benefits": "When you teleport a target you may change their orientation and lower their velocity. This allows you to turn the target up to 360 degrees, which lets you turn them during a charge or run action and either give or remove the prone condition, and cancel out momentum-based movement (such as falling, being thrown or pushed), which effectively resets any distance they've fallen. Using this talent to respond to actions or events outside of your turn typically requires a readied action. You may choose to apply only the effects of Isoport, changing a target's spatial orientation and velocity without teleporting them to another location. Doing so reduces the casting time to a swift action instead of a standard action. If you also spend a spell point, you may Isoport a target as an immediate action. You must possess Unwilling Teleport to affect unwilling targets, and spend a spell point as usual."
    },
    "mass teleport [mass]": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to teleport multiple creatures, up to 1 additional target per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). You may choose whether or not to include yourself in the group to be teleported. Each creature must be touching you or someone else in the affected group to be teleported, unless you possess the Ranged Warp talent. If you possess the Unwilling Teleport talent, you only need to spend one spell point no matter how many unwilling targets are affected. If one unwilling target succeeds at their saving throw, other creatures are still affected as normal. All targets must be within the same distance from each other at their destination as they were required to be in order to be teleported (touching, unless you possess Ranged Warp)."
    },
    "pouncing teleport": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point or increase your teleport casting time by one step in order to make a single attack after successfully teleporting yourself. You may also spend an additional spell point to make either a full attack or take an attack action instead of a single attack after successfully teleporting. You may not use this talent in conjunction with any abilities or conditions that reduce the action needed to teleport (such as Emergency Teleport or Quick Teleport)."
    },
    "quick teleport": {
      "benefits": "When teleporting yourself or a group that includes yourself, you may spend an additional spell point to teleport as a move action instead of a standard action. You cannot make a free touch attack as part of a quick teleport, but you may affect another creature if you are already touching them."
    },
    "ranged warp [range]": {
      "benefits": "You no longer need to be touching another creature in order to teleport them, although the creature must still be within close range to be affected in this manner. Likewise, when you use a (space) talent, the target or location to be affected may be any appropriate target or location within close range instead of touch range. You may take this talent multiple times. Each time it is taken, increase the range by 1 step (close to medium, medium to long)."
    },
    "recall": {
      "benefits": "Before you teleport yourself or a willing ally, you may designate the target's current square as a recall point by increasing the casting time of your teleport by one step or by spending a spell point. At the end of each round, the target may choose to return to the recall point, teleporting there without spending an action so long as it is within medium range (or long range, if you possess Distant Teleport). The recall point lasts for 1 round per caster level or until used once, whichever comes first."
    },
    "segmented warp": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to split a teleport in two. You cast a single teleport on yourself and pay any spell point costs once, but may teleport yourself twice in quick succession. Between these two teleports you may only take one action of any kind you have remaining. Casting the second teleport does not require a second action, but provokes an attack of opportunity regardless (though you may cast defensively or use other methods to protect yourself from such attacks). The total distance covered by both teleports cannot be longer than the maximum range of the initial teleport. If your second teleport is disrupted by an attack of opportunity or other means, it is lost. If used in conjunction with Pouncing Teleport you do not get extra attacks, but may make your attack after either half of the split teleport. Attacking this way counts as your single action for the purposes of Segmented Warp. If you choose to full attack, you may instead use any number of your attacks as a single action, and use any remaining attacks after your second teleport. Other abilities that would create additional effects with your teleport (such as dual sphere feats) only apply to one of the split teleports."
    },
    "splinter": {
      "benefits": "When teleporting a target (usually with the Teleport Object or Unwilling Teleport talents), you may splinter the target, causing it to appear not quite as it was. This deals 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6) to the target. This damage bypasses all damage reduction, energy resistance, and hardness."
    },
    "swap placement": {
      "benefits": "When teleporting yourself or another creature to a location already occupied by a different creature, you may send the creature already occupying that location back to where the teleporting creature came from. This must be a willing target unless you possess the Unwilling Teleport talent. If the second target is unwilling, you must spend a spell point and they are allowed a save as normal. If they succeed at this saving throw, the teleporting creature returns to their point of origin unharmed."
    },
    "teleport object": {
      "benefits": "You may teleport objects independent of people. The object cannot weigh more than 10 pounds per caster level, and it cannot be in the possession of another creature (in their hand or on their person). If a creature is willing, you may teleport the object directly into their hand or onto their person. If you possess the Ranged Warp talent, you may, as a readied action, catch a projectile out of the air that passes within range, redirecting it against another target if you wish. The creature who initiated the attack is allowed a Will save to negate this effect, and you must make an attack roll against the new target, but using your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity when making the attack. Damage is still determined by the creature who initiated the attack."
    },
    "teleport trap": {
      "benefits": "You may lay a teleport effect onto an adjacent, unoccupied 5-foot square. If you possess the Ranged Warp talent, you may place this effect anywhere within that range. This is a latent teleport effect, except it only activates when a creature steps onto the target square, and must target the triggering creature. You must possess the Unwilling Teleport talent and spend a spell point as usual if you want your teleport trap to affect unwilling targets. You must possess the Teleport Object talent to affect unattended objects, and may decide when making the teleport trap whether unattended objects will trigger the effect or not. If you possess the Mass Teleport talent, you may spend a spell point to allow the teleport trap to remain after its initial use, affecting additional creatures who enter its square until the duration expires or it has attempted to teleport 1 creature + 1 per 2 caster levels (minimum 2 total). You must designate the destination where triggering creatures will be teleported when creating a teleport trap. When a creature steps into the triggering square, the teleport effect activates, transporting the triggering creature to the designated destination. Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw as normal. A teleport trap lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before becoming inert. This is a magical trap with a Perception DC and Disable Device DC equal to the teleport's save DC. You may only have one teleport trap active at a time. You may select this talent multiple times. Each time this talent is gained beyond the 1st, increase the total number of teleport traps you may have active at one time by 1."
    },
    "timed warp [jester's hb]": {
      "benefits": "When you teleport, you may choose to delay the effect for up to a number of rounds equal to your caster level. The teleport does not come into effect immediately and instead takes place at the start of your turn after the chosen number of rounds occur. You must decide on any variables and pay any additional spell points for this teleport effect (e.g. distance, direction, etc.) when you delay the effect. When the delayed teleport occurs, if the target location is not valid, the effect fails and does not occur. For example, a teleport can fail if you do not pay an additional spell point for Unseeing Teleport and, when the delayed teleport occurs, the teleport would move you to a space you do not have line of sight for. If you spend an additional spell point when delaying a teleport with this talent, you may cast and delay a second teleport effect which must be delayed at least one additional round longer than the first teleport you delayed."
    },
    "unseeing teleport": {
      "benefits": "You may spend an additional spell point when making a teleport to no longer require line of sight to the destination; instead of choosing a spot to appear, you may instead indicate a direction and distance. If the target arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you may spend a spell point to return the target to its point of origin unharmed. Otherwise, the target takes 1d6 points of damage and is shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, the target takes an additional 2d6 points of damage and is shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, the target takes an additional 4d6 points of damage and the teleport simply fails."
    },
    "unwilling teleport": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to teleport an unwilling creature as you can a willing creature. This requires a touch attack if done at touch range, the unwilling creature is allowed a Will saving throw to negate being teleported, and the effect is subject to spell resistance. An unwilling creature can only be teleported into open areas on solid surfaces (thus, they cannot be teleported into the air or into a solid object, and any such attempt instantly fails). In addition, they gain a +4 bonus to their saving throw if the location would be directly harmful to them (onto a bed of spikes, etc.)."
    },
    "warping strike [strike]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with making a teleport or activating a (space) talent that targets a creature or object. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also struck by the teleport or (space) talent. You can only teleport a willing target unless you also use Unwilling Teleport. If using a scatter weapon, the sphere effect only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack. Space Talents"
    },
    "avert (space)": {
      "benefits": "You may bend space around yourself to avert attacks. When you bend space against an attack targeted at you, the originator of the attack must make a Will save or have their attack veer wide and miss. You must normally ready an action to make use of this ability since bending space requires a standard action, but you may spend a spell point to use it as an immediate action instead. When you take the total defense action, you may use this ability as an immediate action until the beginning of your next turn without paying a spell point."
    },
    "blink (space)": {
      "benefits": "A creature affected by this ability interacts with physical objects erratically. You may choose to apply this effect as a benefit or penalty. As a benefit this grants the target an effect similar to concealment (20% miss chance +5% per 3 caster levels, maximum 50%) against attacks against them. As a penalty, the target always attacks as if into concealment (suffering a 20% miss chance +5% per 3 caster levels on all attacks, maximum 50%), but may attempt a Will save to negate the effect. Miss chance from either version is not applied to force effects or effects that pass between coterminous planes (such as attacks from weapons with the ghost touch special ability). Miss chance from this effect does not stack with miss chance from other blink effects, being incorporeal, or similar effects; only the highest applies. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, though you may spend a spell point to sustain it for one minute per caster level without the need for concentration."
    },
    "create gap (space)": {
      "benefits": "You bend space to create a gap in an otherwise solid object or wall. By spending a spell point, you can create a hole in an inanimate object up to a 5-ft. cube in size plus an additional 5-ft. cube per 4 caster levels placed in any configuration so long as it is contiguous. This hole does not damage the object or affect its structural integrity; since the created hole is formed of added space rather than removed space, everything in the affected area is still accessible, pushed to the nearest edge of the created gap. If the gap is created so that a creature would fall through it, they may make a Reflex save to safely move to the nearest edge of the hole. This hole lasts as long as you concentrate, though you may spend a spell point to allow a gap to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration."
    },
    "dimension pierce (space)": {
      "benefits": "You allow one touched object or creature to interact with other planes by spending a spell point. A touched creature can target ethereal and incorporeal targets without suffering a 50% miss chance or reduction in damage, and can manipulate such targets as if they were material. A touched object gains the ghost touch special ability. The effects of this talent last for one hour per caster level."
    },
    "distort size (space)": {
      "benefits": "You distort the target's spatial footprint, causing them to occupy a smaller or larger area. You may add or subtract 5 ft. to the space they occupy (so an enlarged Medium creature would occupy a 10-ft. cube instead of a 5-ft. cube, and a shrunken Gargantuan creature would occupy a 15-ft. cube instead of a 20-ft. cube). You can alter the target's space by an additional 5 ft. for every 4 caster levels you possess. This does not change the target's size category for any purpose such as reach, damage, or modifiers, though their reach does extend from the new space they occupy. If you would shrink the target's space below a 5-ft. cube, you instead halve their space for each 5 ft. you would normally subtract, rounding down to the nearest half foot (a Medium creature shrunk by one step would occupy a 2-1/2-ft. cube, or a 1-ft. cube if shrunk by two steps). You may alter the target's space anywhere from their normal size as a swift action each turn (or as part of a concentration action). When you use this ability on a target, you can also grant them control, allowing them to spend a swift action to change their space each turn following the same rules. This effect lasts for as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to maintain it for 1 minute per caster level without concentration."
    },
    "extradimensional room (space)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a small pocket dimension, accessible through a shimmering portal that either appears in the air before you or on a touched, reasonably flat surface. This pocket dimension measures one 10-foot cube per caster level, arranged as you wish so long as the space is continuous. You can make the entrance as small as 5-foot square or as large as 10-foot square. You can select its light level and temperature (from -40\u00b0 F to 120\u00b0 F, -40\u00b0 C to 50\u00b0 C), but otherwise it is a featureless location. This space does not exist until you enter the portal, and continues to exists as long as you are inside. However, you may spend a spell point to create the space without entering, and allow it to remain for up to 1 round per caster level regardless of whether or not you are inside it. If the portal is placed on the ground or in some other way an unwilling creature might fall in, the creature is allowed a Reflex save to evade. Climbing the walls of this room requires a DC 20 Climb check. When this ability expires or is dispelled, all objects and creatures within this space are harmlessly ejected through the portal. You may take this talent two times; when taken a second time you gain greater control over your room. As long as you concentrate, the room remains even if you are not inside it. You do not need to continue concentrating while inside the room, but must begin concentrating again if you exit for the room to remain. In addition, as a standard action or as part of concentration, you can bar the portal and prevent anything from crossing it. Anyone inside can reopen the door as a standard action, while anyone outside can force the portal open with a Strength check or slip through with an Escape Artist check (with the DC being equal to 10 + 1/2 caster level + casting ability modifier). While barred, the portal can still be seen and the room dispelled from the outside. Lastly, if you also possess the Extradimensional Storage talent, you may withdraw any number of items from your Extradimensional Storage and place them on any stable surface in the room when it is created. When the room expires or is dispelled, you may have any unattended items inside of it be placed directly into the space of your Extradimensional Storage talent rather than ejected so long as they do not exceed its weight limit."
    },
    "extradimensional storage (space)": {
      "benefits": "You gain a permanent extradimensional space that may hold up to 10 pounds per caster level of non-living material. You can create a portal to this extradimensional space within arm's reach at will. Placing an object in this space or calling an object from this space requires a full-round action, but may be done as a swift action by spending a spell point. Living things and attended objects cannot be placed in your extradimensional storage. If you die (or are destroyed, if you lack a Constitution score), all contents of your extradimensional space appear in your square or the nearest unoccupied space. You may take this talent two times; when taken a second time your extradimensional space may hold an additional 15 pounds per caster level, for a total of 25 pounds per caster level. In addition, you may place or withdraw an object from your extradimensional space as a move action instead of a full-round action, which counts as drawing the equipment normally. If the object would normally be worn or have to be donned in some way (such as armor or a magic ring), you may remove or don it as part of the same action as placing or withdrawing it from storage."
    },
    "flex space (space)": {
      "benefits": "You can choose to either contract or expand space in an area equal to three 10-ft. cubes, plus an additional 10- ft. cube per caster level. These cubes must be arranged contiguously, but otherwise may assume any shape. Contracted space is easier to move through, allowing you to move 10 ft. per 5 ft. of movement. Expanded space is more difficult to move through, and 10 ft. of movement allows you to only move one 5-ft. square. These effects multiply and divide all other movement costs (such as difficult terrain or poor visibility), and are a specific exception to the normal rule for doubling. This area lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. If you occupy squares with different effects on your movement speed, you move at the slowest rate of all the squares. If you attempt to contract an expanded space (or vice versa) you must succeed on an MSB check against the opposing effect. On success, your effect functions normally and the opposing effect is suppressed for the duration."
    },
    "fluctuate (space)": {
      "benefits": "By spending a spell point you can charge a target with spatial instability. Each turn they may teleport as a swift action, with the range decreased to 10 ft. plus an additional 5 ft. per 4 caster levels. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate. As a free action you may spend a spell point to allow the effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without the need for concentration. You cannot select this talent if you possess the Bender drawback, or otherwise do not possess the teleport function of the Warp sphere."
    },
    "looped space (space)": {
      "benefits": "You bend the edges of an area, bounding it with your magic and trapping creatures inside. The bounded area measures one 10-ft. cube, and you may increase the area by an additional 10-ft. cube per 5 caster levels, arranged as you wish so long as the entire area is contiguous. Anyone inside the area must succeed on a Will save to move out of the area. On a failed save, they instead move to the opposite face of the area and must wait until their next turn to attempt to leave it again. This does not prevent attacks across the boundary in either direction, and creatures may enter the area without difficulty. This area lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration. If you also possess Plane Manipulator, you may spend a spell point to apply its dimensional anchor effect to the area of your looped space, contesting teleportation and planar travel to an MSB check."
    },
    "plane manipulator (space)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a dimensional anchor emanating from yourself, affecting you and all creatures within 10 feet per caster level. You must concentrate each round to maintain this effect, although you may spend a spell point to allow the emanation to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. Any attempt to teleport or cross planes made by any creature within this area fails unless they succeed at a magical skill check against you. This also applies to the summoning of companions and other extraplanars. You may also touch a creature from another plane and spend a spell point to banish them back to their home plane (Will negates)."
    },
    "spatial reach (space)": {
      "benefits": "You can imbue a creature with magic that bridges the distance between them and anything they reach or move towards, contorting space to their benefit. The target gains a +10 ft. enhancement bonus to their movement speed and adds 10 ft. to their natural reach, though they do not threaten with this additional reach. Both bonuses increase by 5 ft. per 5 caster levels. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration."
    },
    "teleport beacon (space)": {
      "benefits": "You may spend a spell point to designate a touched spot, object, or creature as a personal dimensional beacon, which lasts for one hour per caster level. You may spend a spell point to teleport yourself to your teleport beacon regardless of how far away it is, so long as it is on the same plane. If your teleport beacon is a creature or object, you may instead teleport your teleport beacon to you. You must use the Unwilling Teleport talent to do this with an unwilling creature, and they are allowed a saving throw as normal. There is no limit to the number of teleport beacons you can have active at one time. If you possess multiple teleport beacons and the Mass Teleport talent, you may use the Mass Teleport talent to teleport multiple teleport beacons at once, as if you were touching all affected targets. All affected teleport beacons must be teleported to the same location (you, or an unaffected teleport beacon of your choice)."
    },
    "warp link (space)": {
      "benefits": "You may create a link to a touched spot, object, or creature, allowing you to know the direction and distance to it. You know if the target is on another plane and whether that plane is coexistent, coterminous, or separate from the plane you are on, but you do not know their direction and distance if they are on another plane. If your target is unwilling, you must succeed on a melee touch attack (or a ranged touch attack with Ranged Bend) to create the link, and they are allowed a Will save to negate the effect. The link lasts for one hour per caster level. You may only maintain one link at a time, though you may spend a spell point to create a link that does not count against this limit. If you also possess Teleport Beacon, your beacons gain all the effects of this talent as if they were also links."

    "wormhole (space)": {
      "benefits": "You touch a single 5-ft. square and link it to another 5-ft. square (plus an additional 5-ft. square per 2 caster levels) within close range of it, contracting the space between them. Anyone may choose to use 5 ft. of their movement to travel in a straight line between two linked squares as if they were adjacent (though they are not treated as adjacent for any other purpose). This wormhole lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration. If you possess Ranged Bend more than once, this also increases the maximum distance between the touched squares (allowing you to place squares within medium range of one another if Ranged Bend has been taken twice, or long range if taken three times).

A detached brain is still able to think and direct the body if detached.

    "create demiplane": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Warp sphere (Extradimensional Room (space)), Creation sphere (Expanded Materials (material)), caster level 15th. When using the Extradimensional Room talent, you may spend 3 spell points to create your extradimensional room as an instantaneous effect; it becomes a permanent demiplane and cannot be dispelled, no matter who is or is not inside. Alternatively, you may use this ability to create a new portal to a permanent demiplane you have previously created. You may permanently close a portal to your demiplane as a free action, but know that only interdimensional travel can reach a demiplane without a working portal. As a permanent demiplane, you have much more control over the composition, appearance, and contents of your room. The demiplane can be filled with air or water (your choice), and could have an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \"walls\" and \"ceiling\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. While it is still generally featureless, you may transplant plants or animals to your demiplane to create an ecosystem and manipulate the earth, water, and/or stone of the demiplane as you would any other materials. If you possess the Blood sphere in addition, you may include blood in any place that you would normally be able to place water. This blood can be supernaturally resistant to congealing, remaining liquid for indefinite periods of time. If you use this ability while within your demiplane, you may either permanently increase its size by an additional 10-foot cube per caster level, or add or remove one of the following traits to the entire demiplane: Energy:  You grant your demiplane the (minor) negative- or positive-dominant energy trait. A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits. Magic:  You may grant your plane the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you select dead magic, you are affected along with everything else and cannot cast on your plane. If you select enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \"effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\" or \"death spells and effects\". A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of magic. Morphic:  Your plane reacts to your thoughts; you may adjust the terrain's shape as an at-will ability. By concentrating for 1 minute, you may adjust a 150-foot square (10 feet deep) portion of earth, stone, or plantlife, shaping it however you will. This is not fast enough to do damage or trap creatures, but may be used to create fences and walls, ditches, human shapes, embankments, and others. Portal:  If you possess the Planeshift advanced talent, you may grant your demiplane a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it). Time:  By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. If you possess the Time sphere, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time, GameMastery Guide p. 185). Alignment:  If you possess the Fate sphere, you can grant your plane the (mildly) chaos-, evil-, good-, law-, or neutral- aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, Gamemastery Guide p. 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have. Bountiful:  If you possess the Nature sphere, you may grant your demiplane a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane per day. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on; dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations. Elemental:  You may grant your plane the air-, earth-, fire- , or water-elemental dominant trait. Gravity:  By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. You may adjust the plane's gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional. Weather:  If you possess the Weather sphere, you may grant a weather and seasonal cycle to your demiplane, customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter or have week-long seasons). Shape:  By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. You may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge. You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane. Structure:  You may give your demiplane a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what abilities you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner.)"

You may spend 2 spell points to designate a 20-foot radius area centered within medium range as being completely immune to extradimensional travel. For 1 day per caster level, any attempt within this area to cross space or planes (including all Warp sphere effects, summoning a companion from the Conjuration sphere, astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, and similar spell-like abilities) instantly fails. A dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when it is created, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the effect does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell."

If you instead spend 2 spell points, the portal has a permanent duration and dispelling attempts affect it as if it were a magic item. Effects that would destroy a magic item (such as Counterspell, Greater) can also destroy the portal."

    "extradimensional torpor (space) [apoc]": {
      "benefits": "Source:   Spheres Apocrypha: Cohorts & Companions Prerequisites:  Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage (space)). You gain a permanent extradimensional space that can be used to store creatures in a state of a deep trance. This space may store up to 6 creatures at once, plus an additional 1 for every 4 caster levels. By spending a spell point you can place a creature carrying a light load or less into an extradimensional space which puts them into a sleep-like state (unwilling creatures gain a Will saving throw to prevent this). While in extradimensional torpor, the creature is helpless and unconscious (this ignores any immunity to sleep), but does not need to breathe. Time flows normally in the torpor meaning that continuous effects (such as poisons) don't stop, and beings in torpor require sustenance as normal. As a free action, you may release a creature from torpor into an area within range of a space effect that's large enough to house it and would cause it no harm (any attempt to do otherwise fails automatically). Creatures willingly put into torpor can exit torpor at anytime to any location they desire within range (despite being unconscious, or being under any other modifications such as being under the effects of Stasis Storage). Unwilling creatures get an additional Will saving throw at the beginning of their turn to exit this torpor; if they succeed they can exit torpor similarly to willing creatures. If they fail their Will save for 3 turns in a row, they remain in torpor indefinitely until you release them. Creatures gain a +10 bonus to these Will saving throws if they have more than 50% of their hit points remaining, and receive a -5 penalty to these Will saving throws if they have 10% or less of their hit points remaining. Creatures stored in this extradimensional space are treated as if they were non-living objects stored in extradimensional storage for the purposes of effects that modify that space (such as the Stasis Storage dual sphere feat). If you select this talent a second time, there is no limit to the maximum amount of creatures you may store at once, and you may store creatures carrying a medium load or less."

You may create an area which mimics the environment of another plane or demiplane of your choice, including one which you have created (chosen when you take this talent). The area lasts for as long as you concentrate (or one minute per caster level if you spend a spell point) and measures one 10-foot cube. You may increase the area by an additional 10-foot cube per 5 caster levels, arranged as you wish so long as the entire area is contiguous. The effects that can be mimicked are as follows (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Planar Adventures for rules on these traits). If an effect which is created within the area of this aura leaves the aura, it loses any modifications which it would possess as a result of being in the area. Alignment:  The manifest zone gains the chaos-, evil-, good-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment traits corresponding to the plane. \n Elemental:  The manifest zone gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait corresponding to the plane. (requires caster level 10th) \n Energy:  The manifest zone gains the minor negative- or minor positive-dominant energy trait corresponding to the plane. At caster level 15th, it may gain the major negative- or major positive- dominant energy trait corresponding to the plane. \n Gravity:  The manifest zone's gravity is heavy, light, or normal, corresponding to the plane. At caster level 15th, you may choose to make the gravity none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional, corresponding to the plane. \n Magic:  The manifest zone gains the enhanced magic, impeded magic, limited magic, normal magic, or wild magic planar traits corresponding to the plane. At caster level 20th, you may choose to make the manifest zone dead magic (which does not cause the manifest zone itself to end or be suppressed). \n Time:  If the mimicked plane has a rate of time different from normal time, the manifest zone is affected in different ways. All creatures within the manifest zone (including the caster) are affected.\n \n Erratic Time:  The manifest zone is affected as per the Time Bubble time sphere talent with a caster level equal to your Warp sphere caster level. Any creature which enters the manifest zone or starts within it must make a Will saving throw or be affected by the Broken Time talent with equal caster level. \n Flowing Time (fast):  The manifest zone is affected as per the Time Bubble time sphere talent with a caster level equal to your Warp sphere caster level.

    "organ detachment (space) [alienist hb]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Warp sphere, caster level 10th. You may spend 10 minutes and 3 spell points to enhance the body part of a touched creature so that it functions as if it were connected to the rest of the body regardless of where it is. For example, if you were to use this effect on an eye and remove it from a person's skull, the owner would still be able to see out of that eye. A detached hand or arm could still manipulate objects on its own. Organs separated from the body are typically objects 2 sizes smaller than the creature they belong to and do not have any bonuses to AC. They are considered to have a Strength score equal to half of their owner. Any damage dealt to an organ is transferred to the organ's owner. If an organ has some sort of mobility (such as a hand crawling or a head pushing itself around using its tongue), the organ is considered to have a movement speed of 5 feet. You use your own actions to move this organ. A creature takes no damage when an organ affected by this talent is removed or when it is reattached (a standard action which requires that the owner touch the organ). If you reattach an organ to your body, the effects of this ability remain, allowing you to freely detach it again. Creatures may remove vital organs such as hearts, and lungs from their body and hide them elsewhere. Each organ removed in this way gives the creature a cumulative 10% chance to negate critical hits and precision damage against them as per the fortification armor special ability. This effect is cumulative, but does not stack with any similar effects such as fortification armor. This talent may safely remove one organ from a creature per 4 caster levels. A creature may not have their brain removed with this talent. Removal or detachment of organs through this talent are permanent until dismissed or dispelled. If this effect is dispelled (which requires the organ be targeted with the dispel rather than the person the organ belonged to), the organ teleports back to the owner's body so long as the distance between the owner and the organ does not exceed your teleport range (or close range if you cannot teleport). If the organ could not teleport back its owner or is beyond this range, the organ explodes harmlessly and the caster painfully grows a replacement, taking 2d6 points of Constitution drain in the process (or taking 10d6 damage which cannot be reduced or redirected if they are immune to ability drain or lack a Constitution score)."

You may spend 5 spell points to teleport to a point backwards or forwards in time, up to 100 years per caster level, appearing at that point in time at a location of your choice within your teleport range, as though using True Teleport. To see how accurate the teleportation is, consult Table: Mishap found on True Teleport. Your familiarity with the destination time is relative, and knowledge of the destination time may be determined by succeeding on a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check. Succeeding on this check means the caster is treated as the destination time as having been \"viewed once\", and for every 5 you exceed the DC, you are treated as having an additional step of familiarity with the destination time and location. A \"false destination\" result when using this talent would be teleporting to a nonexistent location at a specific point in time, such as a mythical city that does not exist. This talent is otherwise modified normally by Warp sphere talents. For example, possessing Mass Teleport allows you to teleport to a point in time with other creatures. Note:  Time travel is complex. For example, a caster who interacts with the past and returns to their own time may not return to their own original timeline, but instead a parallel universe branching from actions and changes which occurred when the caster interacts with the past. Such changes are ultimately up to GM discretion, and incorporating time travel, whether traveling into the past or future, should be done with caution."

When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d100, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target:  You appear where you want to be. Off Target:  You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d100 of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area:  You wind up in an area that is visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap:  You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \"scrambled.\" You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"Mishap\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll."

The caster must succeed on a Will save to avoid the effect being redirected. If you possess Dimensional Lock, you may spend an additional spell point to use it as an immediate action.

    "burrowing magic (metamagic)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisite:  Warp sphere. Benefit:  You allow a magic effect to function even without line of effect, transporting its effects through barriers that would otherwise impede it. You must still possess line of sight for effects that require it, and the target must still be within the effect's range. Cost:  +3 spell points."
    },
    "companion teleport": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisite:  Warp sphere. Benefit:  When you teleport yourself, you may also teleport a touched creature that has a strong bond to you, such as an animal companion, cohort, Conjuration sphere companion, eidolon, or familiar. You and such a touched creature count as a single target if you use Mass Teleport. Note:  Even if you possess Ranged Warp, you must touch a creature to benefit from this feat. Also, other creatures than those listed may count as having a strong bond, at the GM's discretion. Generally such a creature should have a mechanical link to you, though that may be waived under special circumstances. Special:  You may select this feat and benefit from it even if you possess the Personal Warp drawback."

    "cosmologist": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Knowledge (planes) 15 ranks, Warp sphere (Create Demiplane, Extradimensional Room (space)). Benefit:  When using the Create Demiplane advanced talent, you may add the Portal, Time, Alignment, Bountiful, and Weather traits to your demiplane even if you do not possess the prerequisite spheres or talents."
    },
    "dark room (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Dark sphere, Warp sphere (Extradimensional Room (space)). Benefit:  Rather than a shimmering portal, the entrance to your extradimensional room may appear as a deep shadow, difficult to discern from a normal shadow by mundane means. An active Perception check with a DC of 10 + 1/2 caster level + your casting ability modifier is required to find the entrance if it is cast in conditions of dim light or darker or positioned so as to overlap with an existing shadow. Those inside the room can look out through the portal unhindered. Normal:  The portal to an extradimensional room shimmers conspicuously."
    },
    "dimensional aegis (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Protection sphere, Warp sphere. Benefit:  You gain a (succor) talent that lets you sacrifice an aegis borne by an ally other than yourself to swap places with them by teleporting. They must be within range of your teleport ability, but you do not need to be normally able to teleport others. The ally must be willing or unconscious. This may be done in response to an attack before the results of the attack are determined. If so, the attack changes target to whomever is now occupying the space now occupied by the original target. The attack is not rerolled."
    },
    "dimensional archer (champion)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Warp sphere, +3 base attack bonus. Benefit:  Your dual mastery of ranged weaponry and warp magic enables you to use the following techniques: Anchoring Shot (Sp):  As an attack action you may spend a spell point to make an attack with a ranged weapon. If the attack hits, the target cannot teleport or shift between planes unless it succeeds on a magical skill check against you. This effect lasts for 1 minute per caster level. \n Retreating Reload:  You may simultaneously reload a weapon and teleport, using only the longer of the two actions (so a standard action teleport and full-round action reload would take a full-round action, while a move action teleport and a swift action reload would take a move action). This always takes at least a swift action. \n Warp Shot (Sp):  As an attack action you may spend a spell point to make an attack with a ranged weapon. The attack ignores all cover, even total cover, as it bypasses all barriers between it and the target by either bending space to go through them, teleporting directly to the target, or similar means. The attack is still subject to concealment (such as from being unable to see an enemy behind an opaque wall)."
    },
    "dimensional athlete (champion)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Athletics sphere, Warp sphere. Benefit:  Your movements transcends space itself. You may apply talents with the (motion) tag to teleporting as if it were movement, treating distance teleported as distance moved. In addition, the AC bonus from the Mobility talent applies to any attacks of opportunity provoked by casting teleport. Teleporting is treated as its own unique movement mode, and does not work with abilities that require a different movement mode to function."
    },
    "divining beacon (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Divination sphere, Warp sphere (Teleport Beacon (space)). Benefit:  You may create teleport beacons that you can sense, giving you impressions of everything that happens around them. You know the size and movement of anything in a 10-foot radius around a beacon created this way. In addition, you may divine to see and hear from the location of such a teleport beacon as if you were standing in its position, regardless of your distance from it. Using divine in this way creates a scrying sensor which can be detected with a Perception check (DC 20 + caster level), but can only be dispelled by dispelling the teleport beacon."
    },
    "dreamspace (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Mind sphere, Warp sphere. Benefit:  When you sleep, you may choose to project your mind into a quasi-real space, or dreamspace. This dreamspace is a single 10-foot cube in size (increasing by a single 10-foot cube every 4 character levels, their arrangement determined when you level) and you can select the ambient light level, temperature, and cosmetic style when entering the dreamspace or as a standard action. The cosmetic style of your dreamspace is only partially under your control, reflecting your current dreams, state of your mind, and conscious desires. When you use an action to adjust the style it will always reflect your intended changes, but you do not have fine control over its appearance and your unconscious mind may be reflected in its subtler elements. You can choose to have it appear as a castle, but not a specific castle or place you have seen, and if you are worried it may appear to be under siege or shrouded in shadow. You interact with the dreamspace using a copy of your body and all you wear, leaving behind your physical body in the real world. You may also choose to bring up to a heavy load of unattended, inanimate objects within touch range into your dreamspace with you, causing them to disappear when you fall asleep, and may choose to bring them back in a similar manner when you wake. Your dreamspace and any items left within it persist even while you are not in it, though they enter stasis until you return. Because the dreamspace is not a true physical location, you cannot take any actions that would cause you to leave the dreamspace other than waking up, or that would affect your body or the real world. In addition, the dreamspace cannot be entered using normal teleportation or planeshifting effects. At the GM's discretion, effects allowing travel to normal dreams can enter the dreamspace, and it may count as a dreamscape for certain effects. Otherwise, actions have their normal effects in the dreamspace. Regardless of how you spend your time in dreamspace, you gain the normal benefits of sleep."

    "extradimensional assembly": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Telekinesis sphere (Whirlwind Assembly), Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage (space)).

    "extradimensional pouch [origin]": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Form sphere (Hidden Storage [auxiliary]), Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage x2). Benefit:  Your hidden storage is connected to your extradimensional storage, allowing you to store or withdraw items from your extradimensional storage using the actions it would normally take to store or withdraw them using hidden storage. You may affect targets within your hidden storage with any class features, talents or feats which would affect targets within your extradimensional storage."
    },
    "extradimensional shadow": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Dark sphere (Shadow Stash), Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage). Benefit:  You deepen your shadow by making it a portal into your extradimensional space, combining your magic into one whole; you can no longer use Extradimensional Storage or Shadow Stash separately, instead treating them as a single effect. Your extradimensional shadow combines the weight limit of the two talents into a single progression (15 pounds per caster level, or 30 pounds per caster if you have invested two talents in Extradimensional Storage) and you may store and withdraw items in it using any action options either talent allows. Objects in your extradimensional shadow cannot be affected by creatures with Shadow Stash, and they do not become unavailable if your shadow is stolen: a flickering portal in the shape of your shadow remains, allowing you to access items regardless. If you have invested two talents in Shadow Stash, your shadow may don items even if they are not your size, stretching and warping to fit into them. You must still have the appropriate body slot for the item. You may treat your extradimensional shadow as either talent for all purposes. Among other uses, this allows you to apply the effects of feats like Stasis Storage or World In Miniature to it, which often distort the appearance of your shadow. Whenever it would be necessary to determine whether it is a Dark (shadow) effect or a Warp (space) effect (such as calculating its caster level or how it would be affected by Light), the caster may treat it as whichever they deem most advantageous to them."

    "flash warp (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Light sphere, Warp sphere. Benefit:  You can disappear or appear in a flash of brilliant light. When you teleport yourself you may briefly shed bright light as if you were targeted by your glow. You may apply the effects of (light) talents and other Light sphere talents to the glow, paying any costs normally. You choose whether the effects of the glow begin at your starting position or only at your destination, but the effects apply immediately. This glow does not persist beyond a moment, and ends immediately after its effects have been applied."

    "guarded step (dual sphere)": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Protection sphere, Warp sphere. Benefit:  When teleporting yourself or a group that includes yourself to a location within a ward you created, you may reduce the action required by one step, from a standard action to a move action or from a move action to a swift action, but not to an immediate action or free action."

    "jump scare": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Intimidate 5 ranks, Warp sphere. Benefit:  You can teleport suddenly and in an ominous burst of magic, leaping forward in an unexpected and terrifying display. After you appear, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent in range (demoralize normally has a range of 30 feet) as a free action."

You may teleport other creatures as part of this action but must include yourself among the targets."

    "portal combat (combat) [dbh]": {
      "benefits": "Magical gateways are tools you can weaponize. Prerequisites:  Warp sphere (Mass Teleport [mass], Portal (advanced), Wormhole (space)), caster level 5th. Benefit:  You can use portals you create in a variety of offensive and defensive ways depending on what other abilities you have. Adhesive Portal:  (requires Creation sphere) As part of creating a portal, you may cause it to stick to a flat surface that you can alter and that is large enough to keep the entire portal on a flat plane. The portal moves with whatever surface it is stuck to. Targets that collide with the surface pass through the portal unless they succeed at a Reflex save against your Warp sphere DC. \n Slicing Portal:  Whenever a creature is passing through a portal you have created, you may spend an immediate action to forcibly close the portal while they are in transit. The creature passing through takes 1d6 damage per two Warp sphere caster levels you possess, taking half damage and remaining on whatever side of the portal they choose if they succeed at a Reflex save against your Warp sphere DC. On a failed save, you choose what side of the portal the creature ends up on. \n Throw Portal:  (requires Ranged Warp and Unwilling Teleport) You may move a portal you have created up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels as a standard action (this action counts as concentrating on the portal). Any creature which would have the portal move into their space must make a Reflex save against your warp sphere DC to avoid passing through the portal. The portal must remain within the range of your Ranged Warp talent at all times. Note: Moving Portals:  For any circumstance in which a portal would be moving (in a manner similar to that outline with Throw Portal), creatures in the way are allowed a Reflex save against your Warp sphere DC to avoid passing through the portal."

    "skillful disappearance": {
      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Warp sphere. Benefit:  The ability to teleport is only half of your ability to disappear. Whenever you teleport you can also use one of the following abilities as long as you meet the ability's prerequisites. Exit Stage Left (Disguise 5 ranks):  When you teleport you can attempt a Disguise check as part of the same action, creating and donning a disguise between disappearing and reappearing. You may only disguise minor details when using this ability, and do not get the normal +5 modifier for doing so. \n Flourish:  When you teleport you can create a minor sensory effect (such as sparkles or a soft clap of thunder) when you depart or arrive. You may also leave a Fine-sized calling card where you depart (whether marking the spot with a smoking brand or dropping a single rose petal) that disappears after one hour. \n Make Them Flinch (Intimidate 5 ranks):  Immediately before you teleport you may attempt an Intimidate check against an opponent as a free action, as if making a demoralize check. If you succeed, casting teleport does not provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent. \n Without a Trace (Stealth 3 ranks):  You take advantage of even the briefest windows of opportunity to disappear without being noticed. Immediately before teleporting you may attempt a Stealth check, opposed by a Perception check from any onlookers. Onlookers who fail their check do not see where you have gone or how you left, though they may still find out through other means."

      "benefits": "Prerequisites:  Time sphere, Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage (space)). Benefit:  By spending one minute in concentration, you can lock away part of your extradimensional storage, sending it beyond time and placing its contents in stasis. This renders the selected contents inaccessible until you spend another minute unlocking it, but while they are locked the contents do not suffer wear from age or from effects such as rust or rot while stored in this way, and time spent in the space does not count against the duration of abilities such as (enhance) talents, or time limits such as the time limit reviving a dead creature."

This sensor lasts for the duration of your room, does not cost spell points, and may be moved to any other location in your Extradimensional Room as a free action once per round. You may perceive what this sensor perceives simultaneously with whatever you perceive. If this sensor is dismissed, dispelled, or would otherwise end, you may reform it as a standard action. As a free action once per round, you may have this sensor touch an unattended object or willing creature it is adjacent to.

This world generates naturally and consistent across all extradimensional rooms you create as well as your extradimensional storage. The elements of this world take up no space in an extradimensional storage. By increasing the action of geomancing by one step, you can simultaneously open a portal to your world to access the elements within. The world's exact composition depend on the geomancing packages you possess: Air:  Your world possesses a breathable atmosphere and miniature storms. Each round, it produces enough air to sustain a Medium-sized creature or to create a single instantaneous use of air geomancing in an airless environment. Earth:  Your world is formed of soft soil and sand. You may use this soil and sand to generate things like dust storms if you possess that capacity, or you may open a portal beneath a target to form a solid earthen surface underneath them, to a maximum size of a 10-foot square. Fire:  Your world is rich in fuel and produces a constant flame. A Tiny-sized fire burns within it at all times. If it is extinguished, it reignites one round later if conditions permit. Metal:  Your world is shot through with veins of metal. You can use recover ore to extract a Tiny-sized piece of metal ore from your world each day. Plant:  Your world grows plantlife that produces enough food to sustain a Medium-sized creature for a day. These plants can be used for the entangle and harvest abilities any number of times per day, but they are not large enough to count as a tree. Water:  Your world contains rivers and oceans. It produces enough clean water to sustain a Medium-sized creature for a day. You may generate fog from this water any number of times per day, though it is not large enough to produce effects such as a vortex.

If either is too large for the receiving space, they are shunted to the nearest adequate space. \n \n \n 9 \n A small elemental is called adjacent to the caster. This elemental is hostile to all creatures and attacks the nearest to the best of its ability. The size of this elemental increases with caster level: CL 5 - medium, CL 10 - large, CL 15 - huge, CL 20 - elder. Roll 1d4 to determine the elemental type, 1 - air, 2 - earth, 3 - fire, 4 - water. \n \n \n 10 \n A rift opens adjacent to the caster, opening to the elemental plane of earth.

Spell points or spell slots spent are lost. \n \n \n 26 \n Roll again on the Universal wild magic table. \n \n \n 27 \n The caster loses knowledge of any of the talents used in the effect (but not the base sphere) for the length of the effect (minimum 1 round). \n \n \n 28 \n All creatures within close range of the caster (including the caster) are instantly teleported 5 ft. per caster level into the air.

Creatures within this area fall into the pit with no save, though no creature takes falling damage nor falls prone. \n \n \n 41 \n Each round for 1d6 rounds, the caster returns to the location where he began his previous turn. This effect functions even across planar boundaries. \n \n \n 42 \n The caster gains the benefit of the Teleportation Beacon talent fixed to his square at the time this result is triggered.

The caster is not aware of the daze effect before teleporting. \n \n \n 64 \n The caster takes untyped nonlethal damage equal to caster level. This damage does not force concentration checks to cast or maintain sphere effects or spells. \n \n \n 65 \n The caster is instantly teleported 5 ft. per caster level directly upward into the air. If that space is occupied, the caster is shunted to the nearest open space. \n \n \n 66 \n (Combat) All squares out to close range of the caster stretch, requiring any allied creature moving through them to spend two squares of movement each and preventing 5-foot steps. \n \n \n 67 \n (Combat) For 1 round per caster level, all allied creatures within close range of the caster gain the ability to complete their normal movements without passing through any intervening squares. \n \n \n 68 \n (Combat) The nearest allied creature not adjacent to the caster is teleported adjacent to the caster. \n \n \n 69 \n The caster takes 1d4 Constitution damage even if he would normally be immune to ability damage. Creatures without a Constitution score instead take Charisma damage. \n \n \n 70 \n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Will save or be shunted to an empty demiplane for 1d6 rounds. This demiplane has planar traits as chosen by the caster. \n \n \n 71 \n Any hostile creatures that threaten an affected creature may choose to be teleported along with or enter the extradimensional space alongside the target.

This demiplane has planar traits as chosen by the caster. \n \n \n 76 \n The caster gains knowledge of one talent of his choice from this sphere for 1 round. \n \n \n 77 \n The caster gains the benefit of the Teleportation Beacon talent fixed to a square 1d20 miles in a random direct. The beacon persists for 1 hour per caster level. \n \n \n 78 \n Effect receives a +2 bonus to caster level. \n \n \n 79 \n The caster is shunted to the ethereal plane for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 80 \n The caster's armor teleports 5 ft. in a random direction. \n \n \n 81 \n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Will save or have their armor teleported 5 ft. in a random direction. \n \n \n 82 \n A Tiny plush toy appears in the caster's hand. If the caster does not have an empty hand, one held object is immediately dropped to make room for the toy. The toy returns to its place of origin after 1 minute per caster level. \n \n \n 83 \n The caster makes a single magical skill check against all Warp sphere effects within medium range to dispel them as if using the Counterspell feat. This is resolved after the triggering effect. \n \n \n 84 \n The spell point cost of the effect decreases by 1. If the effect did not require any spell points, the caster instead gains 1 temporary spell point that expires at the end of his next turn. \n \n \n 85 \n A rift opens adjacent to the caster, opening to the elemental plane of water. This rift ejects 10 gallons of water per caster level per round for 1 round per caster level. \n \n \n 86 \n A pit appears under the caster with a depth of 5 ft. per caster level and a radius of 5 ft. plus 5 ft. per 5 caster levels. This pit persists for 1 round per caster level. Climbing out of this pit requires a Climb check with a DC equal to 10 + caster level. Creatures other than the caster are permitted a Reflex save to not fall in. The caster and any creatures that fail this save take falling damage as normal. \n \n \n 87 \n All targets or creatures that enter the resultant extradimensional space must succeed on a Will save or take 1d6 points of damage per even caster level (minimum 1d6) untyped damage as the Splinter talent. This damage stacks with that of the Splinter talent. \n \n \n 88 \n All allied creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be shunted to an empty demiplane for 1d6 rounds. This demiplane has planar traits as chosen by the caster. \n \n \n 89 \n (Combat) The caster teleports to the nearest square adjacent to a hostile creature. \n \n \n 90 \n The caster is fatigued. \n \n \n 91 \n A small elemental is called adjacent to the caster. This elemental is hostile to the caster and his allies. The size of this elemental increases with caster level: CL 5 - medium, CL 10 - large, CL 15 - huge, CL 20 - elder. Roll 1d4 to determine the elemental type, 1 - air, 2 - earth, 3 - fire, 4 - water. \n \n \n 92 \n All creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Will save or be shunted to an empty demiplane for 1d6 rounds. This demiplane is flat, featureless, infinite, unaligned, and features normal magic and gravity. \n \n \n 93 \n All allied creatures within close range of the target must succeed on a Will save or have any items held in their hands teleported 1d6 squares toward the caster. \n \n \n 94 \n A rift appears adjacent to the caster, opening a portal to a plane of the GM's choice (the denizens of the chosen plane should be naturally hostile to the caster). One creature of the GM's choice native to the selected plane with a CR not exceeding caster level appears out of the rift each round for a 1d6 rounds and attacks the caster and his allies. \n \n \n 95 \n (Combat) The nearest creature not adjacent to the caster is teleported adjacent to the caster. \n \n \n 96 \n The casting time increases by 2 steps. \n \n \n 97 \n All creatures within close range of the caster must succeed on a Will save or be shunted to an empty demiplane for 1d6 rounds.

This is a latent teleport effect, except it only activates when a creature steps onto the target square, and must target the triggering creature. You must possess the Unwilling Teleport talent and spend a spell point as usual if you want your teleport trap to affect unwilling targets. You must possess the Teleport Object talent to affect unattended objects, and may decide when making the teleport trap whether unattended objects will trigger the effect or not. If you possess the Group Teleport talent, you may spend a spell point to allow the teleport trap to remain after its initial use, affecting additional creatures who enter its square until the duration expires or it has attempted to teleport 1 creature + 1 per 2 caster levels (minimum: 2 total). You must designate the destination where triggering creatures will be teleported when creating a teleport trap. When a creature steps into the triggering square, the teleport effect activates, transporting the triggering creature to the designated destination. Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw as normal. A teleport trap lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before becoming inert. This is a magical trap with a Perception DC and Disable Device DC equal to the teleport's save DC. You may only have one teleport trap active at a time. You may select this talent multiple times.

    "extradimensional room (space) [core]": {
      "benefits": "You may create a small pocket dimension, accessible through a shimmering portal that either appears in the air before you or on a touched, reasonably flat surface. This pocket dimension measures one 10-foot cube per caster level, arranged as you wish so long as the space is continuous. You can make the entrance as small as 5 ft square or as large as 10 ft square. You can select its light level and temperature (from -40\u00b0 F to 120\u00b0 F), but otherwise it is a featureless location. This space does not exist until you enter the portal, and continues to exists as long as you are inside. However, you may spend a spell point to create the space without entering, and allow it to remain for up to 1 round per caster level regardless of whether or not you are inside it. If the portal is placed on the ground or in some other way an unwilling creature might fall in, the creature is allowed a Reflex save to evade. Climbing the walls of this room requires a DC 20 Climb check. When this ability expires or is dispelled, all objects and creatures within this space are harmlessly ejected through the portal. You may take this talent two times; when taken a second time you gain greater control over your room. As long as you concentrate, the room remains even if you are not inside it. You do not need to continue concentrating while inside the room, but must begin concentrating again if you exit for the room to remain. In addition, as a standard action or as part of concentration, you can bar the portal and prevent anything from crossing it. Anyone inside can reopen the door as a standard action, while anyone outside can force the portal open with a Strength check or slip through with an Escape Artist check (with the DC being equal to 10 + 1/2 caster level + casting ability modifier). While barred, the portal can still be seen and the room dispelled from the outside. Lastly, if you also possess the Extradimensional Storage talent, you may withdraw any number of items from your Extradimensional Storage and place them on any stable surface in the room when it is created. When the room expires or is dispelled, you may have any unattended items inside of it be placed directly into the space of your Extradimensional Storage talent rather than ejected so long as they do not exceed its weight limit."

Placing an object in this space or calling an object from this space requires a full-round action, but may be done as a swift action by spending a spell point. Living things and attended objects cannot be placed in your extradimensional storage. If you die, all contents of your extradimensional space appear in your square or the nearest unoccupied space. You may take this talent two times; when taken a second time your extradimensional space may hold an additional 15 pounds per caster level, for a total of 25 pounds per caster level. In addition, you may place or withdraw an object from your extradimensional space as a move action instead of a full-round action. If the object would normally be worn or have to be donned in some way (such as armor or a magic ring), you may remove or don it as part of the same action as placing or withdrawing it from storage."

If your teleport beacon is a creature or object, you may instead teleport your teleport beacon to you. You must use the Unwilling Teleport talent to do this with an unwilling creature, and they are allowed a saving throw as normal. You may take this talent multiple times. You may have a number of active beacons at any one time equal to the number of times you have taken this talent. If you possess multiple teleport beacons and the Group Teleport talent, you may use the Group Teleport talent to teleport multiple teleport beacons at once, as if you were touching all affected targets.

      "benefits": "You cannot change the direction of the wind, but you may overpower it. If you wish to change the direction of the wind, you must create a new wind of the direction you desire. If the wind is the same severity as the natural wind, the winds negate (if they oppose) or join to create a wind with a direction halfway between the two. If one wind is smaller than the other, the smaller wind is negated in favor of the stronger one. Light Wind:  A gentle breeze, having little or no game effect. Moderate Wind:  A steady wind with a 50% chance of extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles. Strong Wind:  Gusts that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose a \u20132 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Perception checks. Severe Wind:  In addition to automatically extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause protected flames (such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly and have a 50% chance of extinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and Perception checks are at a \u20134 penalty. Windstorm:  Powerful enough to bring down branches if not whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames, such as those of lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons have a \u20134 penalty on attack rolls. Perception checks that rely on sound are at a \u20138 penalty due to the howling of the wind. Hurricane-Force Wind:  All flames are extinguished. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a \u20138 penalty on attack rolls). Perception checks based on sound are impossible: all characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds often fell trees. Tornado:  All flames are extinguished. All ranged attacks are impossible (even with siege weapons), as are sound-based Perception checks. While natural winds of severity level 7 can result in a tornado, magically-altered winds of severity level 7 affects too small of an area to create this phenomenon. (Instead of being blown away [see Table: Wind], characters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their Fortitude saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 points of damage per round, before being violently expelled (falling damage might apply). While a tornado's rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph [roughly 250 feet per round]. A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes similar forms of major destruction.)

Flying creatures are blown back 2d6 \u00d7 10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting, unless they succeed at a DC 25 Fly check. Other Wind Effects \n Duststorm:  When severity level 4 winds are created in a desert, it can create a duststorm, blowing fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). At severity level 5, a duststorm deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also poses a choking hazard (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to 10 + her Constitution score)."

When combined with Cold severity 4 or higher, snow effects are added to rain effects. When combined with Wind severity 4 or higher, storm effects are added to the rain effects. When combined with both Cold severity 4 and Wind severity 4, this results in rain, snow, and storm effects. Mist and fog are the exceptions to this, as they only appear when rain is not combined with either snow nor storm. Severity of the snow or storm effects depends on the severity of the Precipitation, not the severity of the Wind or Cold. Note:  While water freezes at Cold severity 3, magic cannot cause rain to instantly become snow as it falls until severity level 4, since the magical water/cold is only augmenting the natural process, not replacing it. Table: Precipitation Severity Level \n Rain Effects \n Combined with Cold 4 and higher (Snow Effects) \n Combined with Winds 4 and higher (Storm Effects) \n \n \n 1 \n None \n None \n None \n \n \n 2 \n Mist \n Light frost \n Mist \n \n \n 3 \n Light/fog \n Snow \n Light storm \n \n \n 4 \n Moderate \n Heavy snow \n Storm \n \n \n 5 \n Heavy \n Blizzard \n Powerful storm \n \n \n 6 \n Flash flood \n Great blizzard \n Monsoon \n \n \n 7 \n Great flood \n Avalanche \n Typhoon Rain Effects \n Mist:  Mist grants all creatures concealment from any creatures over 100 feet away (all attacks suffer a 20% miss chance). Fog:  The caster may create light rain or fog. If fog is chosen, it obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment. Other rain effects:  Beginning at severity level 4, rain has the same effect on fires, ranged attacks, and Perception checks as wind of equal severity level. This does not stack with the penalties provided by wind. The rain also cuts visibility ranges by half, resulting in an additional \u20134 penalty on Perception checks due to poor visibility. It rains about 1 inch per hour at severity 4, 2 inches per hour at severity level 5, 5 inches per hour at severity level 6, and 10 inches per hour at severity level 7. Snow Effects \nSnow causes squares to count as difficult terrain. This requires 24 hours of snow at severity level 1, 8 hours at severity level 2, 1 hour at severity level 3, and happens immediately at severity level 4. At severity level 5, snow obscures vision as fog does. It costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow (about 2 feet). This requires 24 hours at severity level 4, 8 hours at severity level 5, 1 hour at severity level 6, and happens immediately at severity level 7. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds might also result in snowdrifts 1d4 \u00d7 5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind\u2014a cabin or a large tent, for instance. Storm Effects \nBeginning at severity level 4, storms will randomly strike a square with lightning, dealing 4d8 electricity damage (Reflex half) to everything in or above that square. This happens once per minute. This damage increases by 2d8 for every severity level above 4, to a maximum of 10d8 at severity level 7."

    "aridity": {
      "benefits": "As Heat is the opposite of Cold, Aridity is the opposite of Precipitation. If the Precipitation is lowered below step 1 of Precipitation, it becomes step 2 of Aridity. If the Aridity is lowered below step 1 of Aridity, it becomes step 2 of Precipitation. Water left in open air loses about an inch of height per day for every level of combined severity between Heat and Aridity This becomes 2 inches per combined level at Aridity severity level 6, and 4 inches per combined level for Aridity severity level 7. In normal conditions, a character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his Constitution score. After this time, the character must succeed at a Constitution check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Characters that take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to their total hit points begin to take lethal damage instead. Beginning at severity level 2, all creatures suffer a penalty equal to the Aridity severity level to all saving throws against effects that would cause fatigue or exhaustion, as well as to saving throws made against thirst. At Aridity severity level 3 creatures must drink twice as much water per day to stay healthy. At severity level 4, the amount of time a character can go without water before they must begin attempting checks, as well as the time between checks, is cut in half (12 + 1/2 Constitution modifier hours, checks every 30 minutes). This time is cut in half again for each severity level above 4. Even if they are drinking enough water, targets in areas of extreme magically-enhanced aridity still suffer terrible effects as the water in their bodies is constantly sucked up by the environment around them. Targets in areas of high aridity suffer the same chance of suffering nonlethal damage (from desiccation) and suffering fatigue (but not fire damage) as if they were in Heat of the same severity level. This does not stack with the penalties provided by Heat or Cold. However, if combined with Wind or Heat of severity level 4 or higher, the combined effects drain the energy from all living creatures, rendering them sickened for as long as they are within this environment. Characters who have taken nonlethal damage due to desiccation or from a lack of food or water are fatigued. Nonlethal damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as needed, or until they receive magical healing. Other Weather Effects There are weather categories that are not able to be manipulated by basic wielders of control weather, but can become available through taking certain talents. These weather categories are as follows:"
    },
    "ash": {
      "benefits": "Ash is treated as snow, except that, beginning at severity level 4, any creature inhaling it must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save each round or be staggered for one round. The DC increases by 1 for each previous save and by 2 for each severity category above 4. Any creature moving through difficult terrain created by ash takes 1d6 slashing damage for every 10 feet they move (rounded up). Moving through heavy ash causes 1d6 slashing damage for every 5 feet. Ash is a type of volcanic weather, and thus requires the Volcano Lord advanced talent to create."
    },
    "vog": {
      "benefits": "Vog of severity level 2 and 3 act as mist and fog. Starting at severity level 4 it also causes all in the area to become sickened until it leaves the area (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save). For each severity level above 4, the DC increases by 2. At severity level 6, all within the area are nauseated as long as they remain in the area and for 1d6+1 rounds after they exit. At severity level 7, they also suffer 1d6 Constitution damage per round as they inhale poisonous gas (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save). Vog is a type of volcanic weather, and thus requires the Volcano Lord advanced talent to create."
    },
    "fallout [cata. hb]": {
      "benefits": "Fallout of severity level 3 forces creatures inside the area to attempt a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1 point of Constitution damage. Severity level 4 functions as severity level 3, save that checks must be made every 10 minutes rather than every hour. Severity level 5 functions as severity level 4, save that checks must be made every minute rather than every hour and Constitution damage improves to 1d2. Severity level 6 functions as severity level 5, save that checks must be made every round rather than every minute and the Constitution damage becomes 1d4 Constitution drain. Severity level 7 functions as severity level 6, save that it deals 2d4 points of Constitution drain. Damage from fallout is a poison effect. Fallout is a type of radioactive weather, and thus requires the Radiation Lord advanced talent to create. Weather Talent Types"
    },
    "mantle": {
      "benefits": "When you gain your first (mantle) talent, you gain the ability, as a standard action, to touch a creature and spend a spell point, bestowing your mantle upon it. Unwilling targets may attempt a Will save to resist a mantle being placed on them. A mantle lasts for one hour per caster level, and is subject to spell resistance. Having a mantle grants different effects depending on the current weather conditions. Talents marked with the (mantle) tag add effects to your mantle; once you have bestowed your mantle upon a creature they gain the benefits of all (mantle) talents you have that apply to the weather in its area. Abilities and effects that reduces the severity of weather (such as the Weather incanter specialization or Clear Skies mantle) do not reduce the effect of mantles."
    },
    "shroud": {
      "benefits": "While control weather deals in manipulating large weather patterns, a shroud is an expression of extremely localized weather, usually only large enough to effect a single target. You may activate a (shroud) talent as a standard action, placing that shroud on a single creature within your control weather range. Placing a shroud on a target is subject to spell resistance, but a target does not get a saving throw to resist the application of a shroud. Shroud effects persist as long as the caster concentrates. The caster may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow the effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without the need for concentration. Unlike control weather, shrouds produce no lasting effects; any rain evaporates immediately, ice disappears when it leaves the target, etc. Shrouds do not counter the prevailing effects of the local weather (for example, Karakaze does not protect against the effects of Heat), but are also not affected by them (for example, Glare functions even in complete darkness and Heat Stroke works even in arctic levels of Cold). When a creature is affected by two or more shrouds of the same weather type (such as Aridity or Heat) or is affected by a shroud and is in an area of the shroud's weather type of severity level 3 or above, it suffers an additional effect depending on the shroud's type. If a shroud has more than one weather type, it can trigger the added effect of any of its types. Regardless of the number of shrouds affecting a target, any additional effect only affects them once per round. The saving throw DC and the caster level for any additional effect are equal to that of the shroud affecting them. If a target is affected by multiple shrouds with different DCs and caster levels, use the highest DC and caster level for the additional effect (even if the highest caster level and highest DC are from different shrouds). Shroud Additional Effects Aridity:  The target takes a -4 penalty to its Constitution score, which may not reduce its Constitution score below 1. It may attempt a Fortitude save (at its unpenalized Fortitude save bonus) at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round. Cold:  The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls, concentration checks, and AC. It may attempt a Will save at the beginning of each turn to ignore this penalty for one round. Fallout:  The target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every 5 caster levels you possess. Heat:  The target takes a -4 penalty to its Strength score, which may not reduce its Strength score below 1. It may attempt a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round. Precipitation:  Each round at the beginning of its turn the target must succeed at a Reflex save or treat the square it starts in as difficult terrain. They also take a -4 penalty to Acrobatics and Climb checks, and to CMB and CMD. Wind:  Each round at the beginning of its turn the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be moved 1d6 x 5 feet in a random direction. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. If the target cannot move this far (such as if a wall or other creature is in the way) it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet not traveled (minimum 1d6) and falls prone. Weather Talents"

    "dry lightning": {
      "benefits": "When you are using control weather to create Wind of severity level 4 or above in an area of Aridity severity level 4 or above, you may cause lightning to strike as if there were storm effects of a severity level equal to the Wind severity level. The ability to control where lightning strikes and the increased frequency from Storm Lord applies to these lightning strikes."
    },
    "encompassing weather [mass]": {
      "benefits": "When using a shroud, you may spend an additional spell point to affect additional creatures, up to 1 extra creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). Every target must be affected by the same shroud. If you possess a mantle, you may likewise increase the number of targets you affect with your mantle, but the duration is reduced from 1 hour per caster level to 10 minutes per caster level."
    },
    "focused weather": {
      "benefits": "When controlling weather, you may reduce the size of the effect down to a minimum radius of 25 feet and place the effect anywhere so long as it is contained within your control weather range."

      "benefits": "When you are using control weather to create Wind, the DC to avoid being blown away in the area or to move against the wind while checked, and the penalty to Perception checks are increased by your casting ability modifier (minimum 1). The penalty to ranged attack rolls increases by half this amount (minimum 1)."

    "greater weather": {
      "benefits": "When you use control weather, you may spend an extra spell point to affect 2 weather categories instead of 1, or two extra spell points to affect 3 weather categories instead of 2. You do not need to change these categories in the same way, or make them the same severity level (i.e., you may make one category more severe, while making another less severe)."
    },
    "head in the clouds": {
      "benefits": "You can concentrate on two shroud effects as part of the same action. This talent may be taken more than once, each time increasing the number of shroud effects you can concentrate on as part of the same action by one."
    },
    "instill weather [instill]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and instill a mantle or shroud inside it, which functions as a potion or oil. You must spend a spell point to allow shrouds to endure without concentration. An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action."
    },
    "lengthened weather": {
      "benefits": "When you spend a spell point to allow your control weather effect to persist without concentration, you may cause the effect to persist for 1 hour per caster level instead of 1 minute per caster level."

    "severe weather": {
      "benefits": "When you control weather, you may spend an extra spell point to raise the severity you can create or alter with your control weather by 1 level, to a maximum of severity level 7."
    },
    "snow lord": {
      "benefits": "When you are using control weather to create a Precipitation severity level 4 or above in an area of Cold severity level 4 or above, you can choose to change the snow to hail. Hail has the same effect on movement as snow, but it also deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage per severity level of Precipitation to everything within the affected area. At severity level 4, the visibility penalty of rain does not apply to hail, and the -4 penalty to Perception only applies to Perception checks based on sound."
    },
    "storm lord": {
      "benefits": "When you are using control weather to create Precipitation of severity level 4 or above in an area of Wind severity level 4 or above, you can control where the lightning bolts strike. You may take this talent a total of twice. If taken twice, you may increase the frequency of lightning strikes to 1 per round."
    },
    "weather strike [strike]": {
      "benefits": "As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with placing a mantle or shroud. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also affected by the mantle or shroud. If using a scatter weapon, this only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack. Mantle Talents"
    },
    "barometric mantle (mantle, all)": {
      "benefits": "Creatures bearing your mantle immediately know when weather within medium range is being manipulated, such as with the control weather ability. Although they don't automatically know who or what is changing the weather, they do learn in what way the weather is being manipulated (such as what weather conditions are being affected, and whether the severity levels are being raised or lowered). They may also predict the natural weather within medium range for the next 48 hours and gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against the effect of weather (natural or magically manipulated). If you possess Greater Size, they recognize altered weather and predict natural weather at long range instead of medium, and if you possess the Climate advanced talent they recognize altered weather and predict natural weather at a range of 2 miles."

    "blazing skin (mantle, heat)": {
      "benefits": "When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Heat of severity level 3 or higher, and is struck by a metal melee weapon, natural attack, unarmed strike, or touch attack, the attacker takes 1d4 fire damage.

    "boreal glare (mantle, cold)": {
      "benefits": "When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Cold of severity level 3 or higher, they gain a glare attack that deals 1d6 cold damage, plus 1d6 cold damage for each severity level above 3. This functions as a gaze attack with a range of 30 ft., except that it only affects a single creature each round and only if they focus on a target as a swift action. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage, and the attack is not hindered by precipitation. In addition, a creature bearing your mantle can see clearly through falling snow and sleet as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring miss chance from these obstructions, up to the normal limits of their vision."
    },
    "borne aloft (mantle, wind)": {
      "benefits": "When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Wind of severity level 3 or higher, they gain a 20 ft. fly speed (clumsy). For each category above severity level 3 the speed increases by 20 ft. and the maneuverability increases by one step.

    },
    "clear skies (mantle, all)": {
      "benefits": "Creatures bearing your mantle treat weather as one step less severe, plus one step per 10 caster levels.

GM Advice This advice is from The Tempestarian's Handbook The Power of Weather \nIn many ways, the base Weather sphere abilities to control weather are effects for utility first instead of combat. With nothing but the base weather sphere, a caster could summon fog or rain to cover the party during stealth, or use winds to keep the arrows of a distant enemy away. Heat and cold can be managed during long travel to avoid the pitfalls of extreme environments, or to aid a settlement in times of drought or winter. However, focused weather experts can sometimes find that weather is one of the trickier spheres to play with, both as a GM and as a player. First, it takes significant time to change the weather, meaning by the time you bring the wind or rain or heat to a severity where it will actually make a difference in combat, the battle may be over. Second, because it covers a wide area, only affects creatures while they are in the area, and is indiscriminate in who it affects, weather often hinders a tempestarian's allies as much as their enemies. This handbook has tried to offer several tools to lessen these difficulties. Shrouds, as well as the Dehydration Pulse and Rain Bomb advanced talents help allow a Tempestarian to affect the course of a battle almost immediately. Shrouds also give the Tempestarian the ability to selectively target enemies and spare their friends, while Mantles make affecting allies with control weather a boon. Many tempestarians will thus find useful tools in this handbook, even if they prefer to stick to a more traditional strategy of changing the environment of the entire battlefield. The challenges facing a GM when either a PC or an NPC uses the Weather sphere are deeper and more intractable. The same difficulties facing PCs can face NPCs, and so NPC tempestarians might be wise to pick some of the new talents available to them, though a canny DM with an intelligent NPC can get around these problems by careful encounter design. Some monsters are immune to the effects of weather, and some have other ways to avoid it. Bulettes, for example, burrow underground and are unaffected by weather while protected by a layer of earth, so a caster above ground might pummel the PCs with hail while bulettes pop up, attack, and disappear beneath the earth again. The greater challenge comes from the sheer force available to tempestarians. With the right talents, they can batter entire battlefields with damage and control the conditions of a fight. While the individual damage done by Weather pales in comparison to the Destruction sphere, it is continuous and widespread. They can easily level structures and even entire settlements, and can do so from an early level. To address this problem, this handbook has changed certain talents\u2014Boiling Lord, Cold Lord, Heat Lord, Rain Lord, and Wind Lord\u2014to be advanced magic. While GMs and groups of course have always had the prerogative to restrict the use of these talents if disruptive to play, this change encourages them to consider their power and reinforces the fact that the impact of weather needs to be considered carefully in a game where such game-altering power isn't easily available to PCs. In addition, GMs are strongly encouraged to remember how structures are affected by weather. In addition to the lightning rod and storm shelter (provided both for GMs and for players wishing to construct weather-resistant strongholds), structures built of hard materials such as stone are virtually impervious to damage from weather; objects take half damage from energy attacks before applying hardness, which when combined with the sheer number of hit points most structures possess, makes destroying them with weather an extremely difficult task."

It may make a Fortitude save (at its unpenalized Fortitude save bonus) at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round. \n Cold:  The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls, Concentration checks, and AC. It may make a Will save at the beginning of each turn to ignore this penalty for one round. \n Heat:  The target takes a -4 penalty to Strength, which may not reduce its Strength score below 1. It may make a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round. \n Precipitation:  Each round at the beginning of its turn the target must make a Reflex save or treat the square it starts in as difficult terrain. They also take a -4 penalty to Acrobatics and Climb checks, and to CMB and CMD. \n Wind:  Each round at the beginning of its turn the target must make a Fortitude save or be moved 1d6 x 5 ft. in a random direction.
