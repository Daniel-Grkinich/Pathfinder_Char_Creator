A witch can affect an area with a radius equal to her class level × 10 feet. Blighting a creature is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If used on a creature of the animal or plant type, the creature gains the following curse: Blight Hex—<i>type</i> curse; <i>save</i> Will negates; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1 Con damage. Both types of curse can be removed with a <i>remove curse</i> or similar magic, using the save DC as the DC to remove the curse. A witch can only have one blight in effect at a time.

In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally’s soul must be free and willing to return at the witch’s behest. When the witch touches the creature’s remains (some small portion of the creature’s body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch’s familiar as per <i>familiar melding<sup>UM</sup></i>, as if the witch’s familiar were the target’s familiar. The creature’s soul can remain within the witch’s familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature’s soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature’s soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch’s caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature’s body to return it to life.

When it wakes, the creature's addled state causes it to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the witch's level. The witch must have the slumber hex to select this hex.\"\n",

      "    \"Retribution (Su)\": \": A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across the target's flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature in melee. Immediately after the hexed creature deals damage in melee, it takes half that damage (round down). This damage bypasses any resistances, immunities, or damage reduction the creature possesses. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect.\"\n",

      "    \"Steal Voice (Su)\": \": (Tiefling Only) The witch can steal the voice of one creature within 30 feet, causing it to lose, for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence bonus, all abilities that rely on speech, including talking, casting spells with verbal components, and using auditory bardic performances. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. If this hex is used upon a willing target, the duration lasts for a number of hours equal to the witch's Intelligence bonus. Additionally, the witch can change her voice to match that of any creature whose voice she has stolen with this hex, as pervocal alteration(Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic248).\"\n",

      "    \"Vision (Su)\": \": A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of the future to a creature touched. Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during which time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one another. At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the vision.\"\n",
      "  },\n",
      "  {\n",
      "    \"Waxen Image (Su)\": \": The witch can spend a full-round action to create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within 30 feet. Once the image is complete, the subject must make a Will save. If the subject fails, the witch gains a small measure of control over the creature. Whenever she exercises this control, the creature receives a new Will save to end the effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can use the waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject to do any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed in any direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this attack automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything held. Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture the image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its turn. As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.\"\n",

Each day at dawn, this blessed bush\\r grows a number ofgoodberriesequal to twice her witch\\r level. Berries on the tree remain until they are picked,\\r but the tree can never manifest a number of berries\\r greater than twice her level at one time.

The target ages to the next age category (adult to middle-aged, and so on). The witch gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + her witch level and a +2 enhancement bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for a number of hours equal to her Intelligence modifier. These effects last for a number of hours equal to the witch's level. A creature cannot be aged past venerable age by this hex, and it can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect altogether.

The transformation works asbeast shape IIand is negated by a successful Will save. The transformed creature retains its Intelligence score and known languages, if any, but the witch controls its mind. This effect functions asdominate monster, except the creature does not receive further saving throws to resist the hex. The effect can be removed only with wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch also ends the effect.

      "    \"Curse of Nonviolence (Su)\": \": The witch can curse a creature\\r to prevent it from attacking innocents. If the target fails\\r its Will save, it cannot take violent actions or do anything\\r destructive against any creature with fewer Hit Dice than\\r itself. If another creature takes hostile action against the\\r cursed creature, the cursed creature can act normally in\\r regard to that creature only. This is an abjuration effect.\\r The curse is permanent but can be removed with abreak\\r enchantment,miracle, orwishspell.

      "    \"Death Curse (Su)\": \": This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted. On the third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save. Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.\"\n",

      "    \"Death Interrupted (Su)\": \": A witch with this grand hex can pluck a dead creature's soul from the River of Souls and store it in her familiar for safekeeping and eventual resurrection. In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally's soul must be free and willing to return at the witch's behest. When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as perfamiliar meldingUM, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch's caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature's body to return it to life. If a creature's soul is in the witch's familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.\"\n",

As long as the curse persists, the target takes a \\u20134 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty equal to the witch's caster level to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day.

The witch can use this ability to poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed.

To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service).

The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden byillusory wallspells and locked witharcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as \\\"follow me from 100 feet away\\\"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state.\"\n",
