In order to be admitted into the Monastery of Unblinking Flame and become one of these disciples, a supplicant must prove his worth by outwitting an efreeti. Those who succeed often become monks known as the brazen disciples. Brazen disciples believe that the best way to prepare for this test is to emulate the efreeti's own duplicitous ways. By studying genie contracts, brazen disciples learn how to take advantage of loopholes, and by pondering riddles, they learn how to obfuscate truth.

The invested regent can harness a divine spark to perform superhuman stunts, influence others, and escape injury. Invested regents come from all races and walks of life, but they are more likely to be nobleborn in their cultures. Although some invested regents are acutely aware of their powers' divine origins (such as powers gained from an investment ceremony to Asmodeus in the nation of Cheliax), others do not know the source of their abilities. Invested regents have strong personalities and a destiny to rule.\",\n",

As long as he has at least 1 point in his investiture pool, the invested regent can select one of his saving throws as a swift action and gain a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws of that type for 1 round. If he spends 1 point from his investiture pool during this swift action, he instead gains a sacred bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on the saving throw selected.

Requirements: All vested powers have a minimum level requirement to select them. An invested regent who hasn't reached the required monk level cannot select that vested power. Activation: Most vested powers require the invested regent to spend investiture points; the exact amount is listed after the vested power. Vested powers that cost 0 investiture points don't require the invested regent to have any investiture points in his investiture pool to use the ability. The saving throw against an invested regent's vested power, if any, is equal to 10 + 1/2 the invested regent's monk level + his Charisma bonus. Feats: These vested powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. An invested regent doesn't need to qualify for a feat to select it as a vested power. For example, an invested regent can select Spring Attack as a vested power even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of these vested powers is a free action on the invested regent's turn; until the start of his next turn, the invested regent is treated as if he had that feat. Feats marked with an asterisk (*) can also be activated as an immediate action when it isn't the invested regent's turn. Spells: These vested powers duplicate the effects of a spell and are spell-like abilities. An invested regent's monk level is the caster level for these spell-like abilities, and he uses Charisma to determine his concentration check bonus. Activating one of these vested powers is a standard action.\",\n",

Unlike those of most summoners, a devil binder's eidolon does not willingly serve its master due to a similar philosophical bent. While some devil binders (especially those who do serve Hell) seek more amicable relationships with these infernal servants, others treat their eidolons as mere tools, remorselessly ordering the devils into battle.

Each of these spell-like abilities is usable once per day, and the eidolon's caster level is equal to the devil binder's summoner level.

Soulbound summoners, as a rule, never set out to bind their soul to a dangerous and enigmatic power. Rather, they have found themselves unintentional masters of eidolons through incredible circumstances. Most common are those who forged their pacts with an outsider out of a mutual desire for self-preservation. Other soulbound summoners never contacted a true outsider at all, instead manifesting an eidolon from their minds in response to mental or magical trauma. The events that create such a summoner result in the eidolon fusing entirely to the summoner's psyche. These accidental summoners lack the practiced skill at reaching across planes that most summoners have, but their intense bond with their eidolon grants both summoner and outsider unusual power.\",\n",
      "      \"pactbond curse (ex)\": \": A soulbound summoner's metaphysical connection with his eidolon has profound effects on both of them. The eidolon's alignment always matches that of the soulbound summoner, regardless of its subtype. In addition, at 1st level, the summoner must choose an oracle curse , using his summoner level as his oracle level for determining the curse's effects. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. A summoner that gains spells for his list of spells known as a result of his curse must be able to cast spells of the appropriate level in order to cast the learned spell. The glowing rune that the soulbound summoner shares with his eidolon always appears on a place symbolic of his pactbond curse. For example, a summoner who chooses the clouded vision curse might have his summoner's rune manifest on one of his eyes, while a summoner who chooses the tongues curse might have his summoner's rune appear on his lips. A soulbound summoner's eidolon is summoned from his own psyche rather than a different plane, so spells such as banishment and dismissal do not work when cast on the eidolon. This alters the eidolon class feature.\",\n",
      "      \"soulbound life link (su)\": \": The essence of a soulbound summoner's eidolon resides within the summoner's mind and soul instead of a home plane, and he can use this connection to restore his eidolon with his own vitality. The summoner can use his life link ability to sacrifice any number of his hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way heals the eidolon for 1 point of damage. The soulbound summoner can use this ability even after the eidolon has been killed and sent back to its summoner's mind; if the eidolon is healed enough that its hit point total is above 0, it can be summoned again as normal. This alters life link.\",\n",
      "      \"weakened summoning\": \": A soulbound summoner's eidolon is usually the result of unintended magic, trauma, or a singular pact, instead of rigorous arcane study. Soulbound summoners do not gain the ability to cast the summon monster or gate spells as a spell-like ability.\",\n",
      "      \"soulbound evolution\": \": A soulbound summoner's eidolon gains power from its unusually strong bond with its summoner. At 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the eidolon adds 1 point to its evolution pool. At 11th level, and again at 15th, 17th, and 19th level, the eidolon adds 2 points to its evolution pool. At 7th level, the eidolon can select evolutions even if it does not meet the subtype requirements for that evolution. At 13th level, the eidolon can draw from its summoner's power to cast spells. The spell must be a spell that the summoner knows, and the summoner must expend two spell slots of the same spell level or higher to allow the eidolon to cast the spell. Expending spell slots in this way does not take an action. The eidolon uses the summoner's caster level, feats, and casting statistics for all spellcasting purposes. The eidolon must be able to meet all other requirements for casting the spell, such as being able to speak for spells requiring verbal components and providing any material components or focuses for spells that require them. The eidolon must be able to move its body to cast spells with somatic components, but it does not need to have the limbs (arms) evolution.\"\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    \"Storm Caller\": {\n",
      "      \"source\": \"Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 16 Many summoners beckon monsters from the Elemental Planes, but few are as specialized as storm callers, who channel the elemental energies of the Plane of Air. Storm callers are most commonly encountered in areas where thunderstorms appear frequently, including supernaturally stormy places like the Sodden Lands.\",\n",
      "      \"stormy eidolon\": \": A storm caller must select an eidolon subtype that gains resistance or immunity to electricity at 1st level, such as the elemental eidolon ( Pathfinder Unchained 33) or genie eidolon (see page 27).If the eidolon has neither of these evolutions, it becomes nauseated until it regains one of them. This ability alters eidolon.\",\n",
      "      \"summon storm\\u2019s fury (sp)\": \": A storm caller can summon creatures infused with the power of the storm to help him. This functions as the summoner's summon monster I\\u2013IX abilities, except the storm caller can summon only the following creatures at the indicated spell levels: I\\u2014eagle; II\\u2014small air elemental, small lightning elemental B2 ; III\\u2014dire bat; IV\\u2014medium air elemental, medium lightning elemental B2 , pteranodon; V\\u2014large air elemental, large lightning elemental B2 ; VI\\u2014huge air elemental, huge lightning elemental B2 ; VII\\u2014roc; VIII\\u2014elder air elemental, elder lightning elemental B2 ; IX\\u2014advanced elder air elemental, advanced elder lightning elemental B2 . Any creatures summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity. Alternatively, whenever his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability to summon a magical storm as a standard action. This functions as call lightning with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below. Each bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller's summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect. The storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to his summoner spell list as a 5th-level spell, but he does not automatically add them to his list of spells known. This alters the summoner's summon monster I\\u2013IX abilities.\",\n",
      "      \"electrical polarity (su)\": \": At 4th level, a storm caller and his eidolon can temporarily form an electrical current between them. The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm's fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him. The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm's fury ability (unlike call lightning , this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning. At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon's resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon. This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.\",\n",
      "      \"storm\\u2019s wings (su)\": \": At 6th level, a storm caller can borrow some of his eidolon's elemental might. He can gain the flight evolution ( Pathfinder Unchained 37) as though he were using the summoner's aspect ability, deducting 2 evolution points from the eidolon's evolution pool. If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution. At 8th level, the storm caller's eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution. At 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon. He can use the aspect ability (and at 18th level, the greater aspect ability) to gain additional evolutions. This ability replaces maker's call and transposition.\"\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    \"Twinned Summoner\": {\n",
      "      \"source\": \"Legacy of the First World pg. 18 Reflecting the connected nature of Imbrex, a twinned summoner and his eidolon appear identical save for any obvious differences, such as evolutions or equipment.\",\n",
      "      \"twinned eidolon\": \": The twinned summoner's eidolon is restricted to the biped base form. An unchained summoner's eidolon is instead restricted to the twinned eidolon subtype (see below). If the summoner's natural size is smaller than Medium, the twinned summoner's eidolon must be Small. This ability may require a different base form or subtype to match the twinned summoner's natural form, at the GM's discretion, if the twinned summoner is not a bipedal creature.\",\n",
      "      \"teamwork feats (ex)\": \": At 4th level and at 12th level, a twinned summoner gains a bonus teamwork feat. He must meet the prerequisites of the selected teamwork feat. The twinned summoner automatically grants all of his teamwork feats to his eidolon. The eidolon doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats. This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.\",\n",
      "      \"twinned transposition (su)\": \": At 6th level, as a standard action, a twinned summoner can swap locations with his eidolon as if each were using dimension door , using the twinned summoner's caster level. If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. If either the twinned summoner or his eidolon occupies more squares than the other, each must occupy one or more squares that were occupied by the other if possible, or as close as possible if not. The twinned summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th. At 8th level, he can use this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces maker's call and transposition.\",\n",
      "      \"twin summoner (su)\": \": At 16th level, a twinned summoner can touch his eidolon as a standard action, enhancing its similarity to the summoner. The eidolon loses any natural weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. The eidolon can cast any of the summoner's spells known using the summoner's caster level and spell slots. It doesn't gain the benefit of any of the summoner's items, feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting. The eidolon can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to the summoner's class level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action. This ability replaces the merge forms class feature.\"\n",
