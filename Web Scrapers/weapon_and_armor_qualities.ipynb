Weapons steeped in enchantment and illusion magic, for example, held great power over wielders of transmutation. Such weapons were often banned in Thassilon, so wary were the runelords of their propagation, yet all seven kept champions and assassins armed with runeforged weapons targeting their enemies' weaknesses in secret. Each runeforged weapon opposes a school of magic. T he wielder gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against spells from the weapon's opposed magic. All runeforged weapons are, to a certain degree, empathic.

Anyone wielding a runeforged weapon takes a \\u20132 penalty on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the expense of personality. No weapon can have more than one runeforged weapon quality at a time, and a creature that carries two runeforged weapons (even those o f the same type) takes a \\u20135 penalty on all attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks, as her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges.

The seven correct component combinations and the type of runeforged weapon each combination creates are listed below. Note that the first name for each type of weapon listed is its sinful name\\u2014 the second is the name a virtuous character can use to refer to the weapon. In any event, a runeforged weapon functions the same, regardless of whether it magnifies a wielder's sin or virtue.

When attacking an invisible creature, for instance, the wielder might still need to guess the target's location. In addition to its other abilities, a truthful weapon functions as a special kind of dispelling UE weapon against figments and shadow conjuration effects; if the wielder makes an attack against such an effect, the weapon automatically attempts to use the stored dispel magic against the illusion. If the attempt fails, the wielder is not aware of the attempt, and unless she disbelieves the illusion or the illusion's duration ends, the weapon continues to impart that it is storing dispel magic (though she is free to cast dispel magic on the weapon again if she has another reason to believe the effect was expended and failed to dispel an illusion).

Weapons steeped in enchantment and illusion magic, for example, held great power over wielders of transmutation. Such weapons were often banned in Thassilon, so wary were the runelords of their propagation, yet all seven kept champions and assassins armed with runeforged weapons targeting their enemies' weaknesses in secret. Each runeforged weapon opposes a school of magic. T he wielder gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against spells from the weapon's opposed magic. All runeforged weapons are, to a certain degree, empathic. They enhance sin or virtue in those who wield them, so a fighter armed with a dominant weapon becomes more domineering than before, for example. Anyone wielding a runeforged weapon takes a \\u20132 penalty on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the expense of personality. No weapon can have more than one runeforged weapon quality at a time, and a creature that carries two runeforged weapons (even those o f the same type) takes a \\u20135 penalty on all attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks, as her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges. Each of the seven Thassilonian schools of magic is opposed by a single runeforged weapon quality\\u2014each of these being the combination of that school's opposition schools. The seven correct component combinations and the type of runeforged weapon each combination creates are listed below. Note that the first name for each type of weapon listed is its sinful name\\u2014 the second is the name a virtuous character can use to refer to the weapon. In any event, a runeforged weapon functions the same, regardless of whether it magnifies a wielder's sin or virtue. A wielder who is considered sinful or virtuous (see page 416) with the same type of sin/virtue as a runeforged weapon he wields becomes more aware of danger around him\\u2014gaining a +2 insight bonus on Initiative checks and a +1 dodge bonus to AC.

A suit of heavy armor or a tower shield can store one animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the stored animal from the hosteling armor or shield. A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.

A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.
