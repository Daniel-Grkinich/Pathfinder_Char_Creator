As a standard action, the wearer can touch his animal companion to attach an invisible, incorporeal cord to it that, if it can be seen by anyone, appears to be superficially tied to the silver soul cord. This forms a deeper bond between the wearer and the animal companion. It can be attached to only one animal companion at a time. If the animal companion is killed or the link is broken while the cord is attached in this manner (though very few things can destroy the incorporeal cord), the wearer and the animal companion each gain a negative level and the silver soul cord cannot be reattached to any creature for 24 hours. The cord can extend for a length of up to 1 mile, but if the attached animal companion moves farther away from the wearer than this, the cord automatically detaches and the bond ends, though it is not considered to be broken and therefore does impart any negative levels. The wearer can remove the cord as a standard action. While the silver cord is attached, the wearer gains an empathic link with an animal companion as if it were a familiar (per the wizard arcane bond class feature). Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can sacrifice his own hit points to heal the animal companion through this bond. The creature regains 1 hit point for every 1 hit point the wearer sacrifices. The wearer can sacrifice a maximum number of hit points per turn equal to his Hit Dice, and can't sacrifice hit points if doing so would reduce him to 0 hit points or fewer. Construction\",\n",

      "      \"weight\": \"6 lbs. Description This hole-ridden burlap robe would appear completely worthless if not for the immaculate red velvet lining its interior. When worn inside out, a liar's robe enshrouds the wearer in a continually shifting array of colors, features, and faces that obscure his entire appearance and make physical recognition all but impossible. This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and right side out (revealing his true form) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature wearing a liar's robe must use true seeing or a similar effect in order to pierce through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting humanoid form. The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as detect thoughts or locate creature ) may still be used to recognize the individual. Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a liar's robe is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence.

Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends. As long as the robe has a defensive aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph) spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect, it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to Disguise), any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change. The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the abilities listed in elemental body III ; if it's a plant, the wearer gains the abilities listed in plant shape II ; if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities listed in undead anatomy III UM .

Additionally, while submerged in lava or magma, the wearer can breathe normally, gains a +5 bonus on Swim checks, and can see through the substance as clearly as if it were water. Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer of a robe of magma can conjure a great burst of magma from deep below the surface. This ability can be used only while the wearer is on the Material Plane, and only while on solid ground on a planetary body. The deeper beneath a planet's surface the wearer is, the sooner the magma arrives. If the wearer uses this ability while 8,000 feet (or more) below the surface, the magma arrives instantaneously. If she uses it between 2,000 and 8,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives at the beginning of the wearer's next turn. If she uses it on the surface or down to 2,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives in 1d4 rounds. Once the magma arrives, it bursts from the ground in a geyser that sprays up to 40 feet in height and showers a 20-foot radius centered on the location of the wearer when this ability was activated. This deals 20d6 points of fire damage to creatures in the area (Reflex DC 22 half) and creates a shallow pool of lava in the area of the burst. The magma geyser continues for 1d3 rounds. For each round that the geyser continues, the pool of lava expands its radius by 10 feet. Creatures that enter the pool of lava or begin their turn in this area take 2d6 points of fire damage.

The swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space. The swarm disperses when the effect's duration ends or when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. Rat-tread boots grant the wearer immunity from the attacks of rat swarms, including their special attacks. Construction\",\n",

A touch of avolition is in fact an example of migo technology\\u2014as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect. Applying a touch of avolition requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch of avolition's fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early. Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached. The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar spells. A touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple touches of avolition do not stack.

If Iomedae is the wearer's patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word and give any sword he holds the powers of an evil outsider-bane weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet. If the wearer uses a finger to draw Iomedae's symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first).

The wearer can deliver the dose to a target as a melee touch attack or as part of an unarmed strike or natural attack with the hands (such as a claw or slam attack). In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance. The wearer can use both gloves in the same round using two-weapon fighting or multiple natural attacks (such as 2 slams or 2 claws). Each glove can be used once per day. Filling a glove is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Construction\",\n",

The wearer must announce her intent before making her attack roll, and creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected. To make the attack, the wearer makes a single melee attack at her highest base attack bonus as a full-round action. If the strike hits, the target takes 4d6 points of force damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or fall unconscious until the end of its next turn. Even if the target succeeds at the Fortitude save, it is staggered until the end of its next turn. When worn by a brawler with the knockout class feature, the DC to resist the brawler's knockout increases by 2. Construction\",\n",

In addition to its use as a figurine of wondrous power , an effigy of the favored servant can be used as the repository of a dying soul once per day. By spending a full round action on a sentient, living creature reduced to \\u20131 or fewer hit points, the effigy's bearer can draw its soul into the statuette, killing the creature if it fails a DC 22 Will save. From that time forward, the giant summoned by the figurine has the same personality as the killed creature. The creature must obey the figurine bearer's commands, and the effigy functions as normal. The creature retains none of the skills or abilities it had in life, being effectively trapped within the statuette. The creature cannot be resurrected or otherwise returned to life unless the effigy is destroyed. If the effigy is used to trap another dying soul, the first is released and may be raised normally.

The first daylight diadems were created far to the east by Keleshite worshipers of Sarenrae, but their usefulness in battling undead has seen them become quite widespread. In the often overcast Sodden Lands, these magical diadems offer an additional comfort to those who enjoy the sun as well, serving as a constant reminder that regardless of the cloud cover above, the sun remains steadfast in its guardianship over the day. As part of a standard action taken to channel positive energy, the wearer can activate a daylight diadem by removing a flower to extend the range of her channel positive energy ability to 60 feet. The removed flower is consumed upon use. The wearer can also release the full brilliance of her daylight diadem in a single burst. With a command word, she causes all of the sunflowers remaining on the daylight diadem to be consumed and shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This light counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower and is treated as natural sunlight\\u2014the effect persists for a number of rounds equal to double the number of sunflowers consumed. While within the area of this light, all weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to evil creatures. This additional damage results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to energy. Creatures that are specifically hindered or harmed by sunlight take double this amount (2d6 points of damage per hit). Once all four flowers have been used, a daylight diadem can no longer be activated, but each time the crown is exposed to the light of the rising sun, a new sunflower (to a maximum of four sunflowers) blooms on the diadem.

This compulsion affects even mindless oozes.

Attack : The ooze attacks the nearest creature. Halt : The ooze remains in place. It does not take any actions but is not considered helpless. Move : The ooze moves toward a point in space that the wearer can see. The wearer can control up to 20 Hit Dice worth of oozes at any given time. An ooze with 5 or more Hit Dice can attempt a new Will save each day to free itself from the wearer's control. An ooze ordered to halt receives a new Will save to overcome the helm's control if attacked. Oozes with an Intelligence score, as well as those with 11 or more Hit Dice, are immune to this effect.

This black gossamer cap is woven from ethereal moonbeams and nightmares. Whenever the wearer would experience a nightmare, whether magical or mundane (including the dream haunting ability of a night hag), the cap absorbs it without effect. Once per day, when a changeling wearer sleeps with her face covered by the cap, she can send a nightmare (DC 17). If the victim fails his saving throw against the nightmare, the wearer can target him with major curse UM as well, but must describe to the victim a condition under which the curse will be lifted. The victim automatically understands the terms of the curse even if he does not share a language with the wearer. The condition must be possible to the wearer's knowledge given what she knows of the victim's resources, but may be extremely difficult to achieve and may require significant luck or assistance (at the GM's discretion). A cap of darkest dreams can maintain only one curse at a time; if the wearer uses the cap to curse a new victim, any previous curse ends. Once per day by uttering the command word, a changeling wearer can unleash the vile essence of nightmares upon all creatures around her. She emanates a cloak of dreams APG as per the spell. Any creature sent to sleep by this aura automatically suffers a nightmare (DC 17) evoking its deepest fears. Construction\",\n",

Made of brilliant silver\\r and polished steel, a newly created\\r helm is set with large magic gems: 10\\r diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and\\r 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and\\r sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like,\\r gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: Diamond:  Prismatic spray  (save DC 20)\\r Ruby:  Wall of fire   Fire opal:  Fireball  (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half)\\r Opal:  Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can\\r perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are\\r depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical\\r properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet.\\r This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such\\r creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become\\r a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the\\r weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does\\r not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its\\r powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a\\r jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical\\r fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails\\r an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the\\r helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within\\r range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from\\r the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on\\r the helm wearer.

A drowned shade gains undead immunities and is treated as undead, and it projects a 20-foot-radius drowning aura, which imposes a \\u20135 penalty on Swim checks to creatures without the aquatic or water subtype and negates magical means of breathing underwater. Each round a creature holds its breath within the aura counts as 2 rounds for the purpose of drowning. Once per day, if the wearer falls below 0 hit points, she can destroy a bone to heal herself (this is not an action). A minor soul bone summons a Small water elemental drowned shade or heals 1d8+11 hit points; a lesser soul bone summons a Medium water elemental drowned shade or heals 3d8+11 hit points; a standard soul bone summons a Large water elemental drowned shade or heals 5d8+11 hit points; and a greater soul bone summons a Huge water elemental drowned shade or heals 7d8+11 hit points. The necklace's listed price does not include the price of bones. The wearer can add a new soul bone to the necklace by ritually drowning a sentient creature and paying the additional cost.

The first chokers of this type were created by a cabal of gnome priests of the Eldest from the Abendego Coast, who believed pain could forestall the bleaching. When this choker is placed on a living creature's neck, the bee springs to life and latches itself to the wearer, embeds its stinger deep into her neck, and fills the wearer's throat with swarming bees. Although it produces a disconcerting feeling, this sting and the bees do no harm to the wearer other than to give her voice an aggressive buzzing quality that grants her a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can swallow some of the bees in her throat as a swift action, which coats her throat in soothing, golden honey. For the next hour, her voice sounds silken and smooth, and she gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks rather than on Intimidate checks. Finally, the wearer can release the entire swarm as a standard action once per day. When she does so, she exhales a 15-foot cone of angry bees from her mouth. Those caught in the cone take 4d6 points of piercing damage and are staggered by the painful stings for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw halves the damage inflicted and negates the staggered condition. Construction\",\n",

The wearer suffers no effects from the poison in this manner. While filled, the charm doesn't protect against poison. As a full-round action, the wearer can remove the choker and affix it to her melee weapon by pressing the scorpion against the weapon and allowing the chain to automatically secure itself around the weapon's hilt or handle. If the weapon hits, the wearer can choose to dose the target with the poison (in addition to any effects the attack would normally have) as though the weapon were coated with a dose of the poison.

Description Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse , entropic shield Bones : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to AC for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield , scare Flame : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands Heavens : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, darkness , locate creature Life : This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds Stone : This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a \\u20134 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, heat metal , stoneskin Waves : This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur , chill touch Wind : This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

      "      \"weight\": \"1 lb. Description Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse , entropic shield Bones : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to AC for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield , scare Flame : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands Heavens : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, darkness , locate creature Life : This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds Stone : This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a \\u20134 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, heat metal , stoneskin Waves : This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur , chill touch Wind : This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

A doomsday key can also be used to inflict bestow curse (Will DC 14 negates) once per day\\u2014this use requires a successful touch attack. While worn about the neck (and thus taking up the neck item slot), a doomsday key bestows a +4 resistance bonus on the wearer's saving throws made against curse effects; this protection does not help against curses the wearer may already be suffering from.

If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers. Aberrant : This chunk of pitch-black onyx is suspended on a chain of silver. Strange whorls and tentacle-like shapes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a 25% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack (as the light fortification armor special ability). When making a melee touch attack, the wearer's reach increases by 5 feet. Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur , enlarge person Abyssal : This amulet is a chunk of bright red garnet in which fire seems to dance when light plays across its surface. It hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer gains electricity resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison. In addition, the wearer can grow claws as a free action. The claws are treated as natural weapons, and allows the wearer to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using his full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if the wearer is Small) plus the wearer's Strength modifier. Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, delay poison , magic fang , resist energy Accursed : This swirling green malachite hangs from a chain of oxidized copper. Sinister, unblinking eyes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm, cold, fear, fire, and sleep effects. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can fix his gaze on any one creature within 60 feet. The target becomes staggered for 4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 18). Only one target can be affected by the wearer's gaze at a time; if the wearer attempts to stagger a new opponent, the previous target immediately recovers whether the new attempt is successful or not.

The wearer gains acid resistance 5 and cold resistance 5.

Against evil creatures, the ray deals 1d4+4 points of damage. The damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. The ray heals good creatures of 1d4+4 points of damage, but a good creature cannot benefit from the heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are unaffected by the ray. Moderate abjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, resist energy , scorching ray Destined : This chunk of uncut quartz hangs on a platinum chain. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws and to AC during surprise rounds or any time he is otherwise unaware of an attack. Once per day, the wearer can reroll one attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, or caster level check to overcome spell resistance. He must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the result is revealed. He must take the second result, even if it's lower. Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, aid Draconic : This amulet comes in a variety of minerals depending on its powers, as shown in the table below, and is formed into the shape of a dragon's scale.

The wearer can turn invisible for 9 rounds per day (as greater invisibility ). The rounds don't need to be consecutive. Three times per day, the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to burst out laughing. That creature can take only a move action, but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by this laughter, it is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater invisibility , hideous laughter Infernal : This chunk of black marble hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer gains fire resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison. Three times per day the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to become shaken for 4 rounds.

The wearer gains cold resistance 5 and DR 5/\\u2014 against nonlethal damage. Three times per day the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to become shaken for 4 rounds.

      "      \"weight\": \"1 lb. Description Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse , entropic shield Bones : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to AC for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield , scare Flame : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands Heavens : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, darkness , locate creature Life : This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds Stone : This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a \\u20134 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, heat metal , stoneskin Waves : This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur , chill touch Wind : This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

Description Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse , entropic shield Bones : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to AC for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield , scare Flame : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands Heavens : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, darkness , locate creature Life : This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds Stone : This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a \\u20134 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, heat metal , stoneskin Waves : This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur , chill touch Wind : This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

Description Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse , entropic shield Bones : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones.

Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield , scare Flame : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands Heavens : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds.

Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round.

In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

The first time a character wears the crest, the animal changes to match that of the wearer's heraldic symbol. If the wearer doesn't have a heraldic animal, it takes the form of an animal appropriate to the character's personality. The animal depicted must be one suitable for use as a druid animal companion (see page 53 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook ). Once a character has worn the crest, the animal depicted on the crest is always the same for that character and can't be changed. Once per day, if the wearer of the crest of the fallen falls unconscious (other than voluntary sleep), the animal on the crest jumps out of the badge and becomes a living creature in an unoccupied square adjacent to the wearer. The creature has the same statistics as a 1st-level druid's animal companion of the same type as depicted on the crest, except its hit points are equal to one-quarter of the wearer's maximum hit points. The creature also gains the 4th- or 7th-level advancement as described in the animal companion's statistics if the wearer is of sufficient level (treating his character level as the effective druid level). It doesn't, however, gain any of the other bonuses or abilities of an animal companion. The creature guards the fallen wearer to the best of its ability. It protects the wearer by attacking enemies, assisting allies using the aid another action, dragging the character's body to a safe location, or taking other helpful actions. The creature can't move more than 50 feet from the badge, and it disappears after 5 rounds. It can't use equipment or magic items, including potions. If the animal is slain, it disappears and the heraldic image on the crest of the fallen fades to a dark gray for 1 week, during which time the crest can't be activated. Construction\",\n",

This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers. Aberrant : This chunk of pitch-black onyx is suspended on a chain of silver. Strange whorls and tentacle-like shapes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a 25% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack (as the light fortification armor special ability).

Description Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. Battle : This amulet is shaped like a tiny dagger that hangs point down. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a battle ward, which grants her a +3 deflection bonus to AC. Each time she is attacked, the deflection bonus is reduced by 1 (whether the attack succeeds or not) until the ward fades away when the bonus reaches +0. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can curse a creature within 30 feet, making it take more damage from bleed effects and causing its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for 8 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse , entropic shield Bones : This amulet is a necklace made of petrified bones. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a bone ward, which causes a group of flying bones to encircle her, granting her a +2 deflection bonus to AC for 8 rounds. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can target a creature within 30 feet, causing it to become frightened for 1 round (Will DC 13 negates). Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield , scare Flame : This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands Heavens : This black cat's eye hanging from a silver chain reflects any light that hits its surface back as a six-pointed star. Whenever the wearer can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location, and can add her Wisdom modifier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see). This effect lasts for 8 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, darkness , locate creature Life : This amulet is formed from a petrified robin's egg strung on a simple thong of woven hair. The wearer becomes more receptive to healing magic, regaining an additional 1d6 hit points from any cure spell cast upon her. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cut off any single creature within 30 feet from all forms of magical healing and effects that remove conditions. A DC 13 Will saving throw negates this effect, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute. Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds , inflict moderate wounds Stone : This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a \\u20134 penalty to AC. Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, heat metal , stoneskin Waves : This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Moderate illusion; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur , chill touch Wind : This feather hangs from a chain of slender twigs reminiscent of a bird's nest. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of wind that lasts for 1 minute. When she is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack roll has a 20% miss chance. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage. The sparking aura lasts 4 rounds.

Only one portal can be used each time the talisman is activated, remaining open for 10 minutes (or until the wearer dismisses it) and functioning as the spell gate . The portal cannot connect to any other locations, so should the wearer of the Iron Road pass through the gate and linger in Hell for more than 10 minutes, the hellmouth closes behind him and traps him in Hell. Jyangzipao currently exists only as a portal, and is not an independent creature with his own desires or needs.

Hasharizi happily offers her services as a fence for stolen goods, and she is willing to search the markets of Dis for rare treasures for a commission (typically 10% of the item's cost), providing the talisman's wearer a portable means of liquidating wealth and securing otherwise unavailable goods. It usually takes at least a day for the devil to fence or find the requested items. For those requiring more immediate boons, Hasharizi is always willing to tailor an infernal contract to meet her patron's needs. Jyangzipao's other maw opens just outside Seventh Spire, a lead-brick fortress surrounded by a moat of rusty quicksand in Avernus. The ambitious cornugon Ulkruoth commands the keep and its ever-growing garrison of warmonger devils ( Princes of Darkness 60) and bearded devils. For a fair price\\u2014 much as though the wearer had cast planar ally \\u2014he sells his troops' services as mercenaries. For particularly glorious assignments likely to hasten his eventual transformation into a malebranche, Ulkruoth is known to halve his price or waive it entirely. Construction\",\n",

The wearer can speak with birds while wearing the cloak, as if under the effects of speak with animals . Druids of northern Avistan have long favored these cloaks as a means of communicating with birds of the region, but they grew increasingly popular among several sects in Lirgen as well in the decades leading up to the Age of Lost Omens\\u2014 despite the fact that crows themselves are not native to that particular land. Certainly, the exotic nature of the ebon feathers had an aesthetic appeal, for in a land where brightly colored songbirds were the norm, the concept of a midnight black avian couldn't help but to be somewhat intriguing to the residents. As a move action, the wearer of a crow brother's cloak can command the item to dissolve into a swirling murder of crows, which faithfully surround the wearer for up to 13 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive. The murder of crows functions as a bat swarm . The murder of crows deals no damage to the wearer and provides concealment as long as the wearer remains within it.

As the wearer burrows, displaced dirt swells before her and collapses behind her to create difficult terrain in her wake. She has cover from attacks while burrowing. Unless the wearer has some other means of breathing while submerged, she must hold her breath while burrowing. Emerging from the ground is a move action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Once per day, the wearer can perform a charge attack by diving deep into the ground, burrowing up to 40 feet in a straight line (ignoring any obstacles that don't extend at least 10 feet into the ground) and bursting forth into a square adjacent to a target creature. This use of the cloak does not disturb the terrain as noted above, except where the wearer enters and exits the ground. The wearer ends this movement standing and the target of the charge is considered flat-footed against the attack. Construction\",\n",

This prevents the wearer from communicating verbally, casting spells with verbal components, speaking command words, and so on. Pressing this pearl again suppresses this effect.

Closer examination reveals that each strand of hair seems to have neither a beginning nor an end. Most of these braids are blonde in color, but other hues are not unknown. Up to three times per day, the wearer of a fate-woven braid of the norns can potentially negate a disastrous turn of fortune. Upon rolling a natural 1 on a saving throw or after failing a saving throw against a death effect, the wearer can activate the braid as a free action to reroll the saving throw. The golden thread is vulnerable to severe twists of fate, though. If the result of any reroll obtained by the braid is ever a natural 20, the golden thread frays, permanently reducing the braid's daily reroll uses by one.

      "      \"weight\": \"1 lb. Description This rune-carved bracelet is made of thick, bright gold and allows the wearer to manipulate time through electricity magic. As a swift action, the wearer can activate the bracer, creating a nimbus of crackling blue energy that surrounds the hand wearing the electro-temporal bracer for up to 3 minutes each day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. While the nimbus is active, spells with the electricity descriptor cast by the wearer have an additional effect, chosen by the wearer as each spell is cast: the spell dazzles all targets of the spell for 1 round, the spell staggers a single target of the spell for 1 round, or the spell provides a single target of the spell the benefits of haste for 1 round. The staggered and haste effects affect only one target selected by the caster as the spell is cast, even if the spell affects multiple targets. There is no saving throw for these additional effects, but a target that avoids the effects of the electricity spell entirely (such as by negating the effect with a successful save, or by having immunity to the spell's damage) is not subject to the additional effect. (A target of an additional effect that successfully saves against the electricity spell but still takes partial damage is still subject to the additional effect.) If the wearer takes at least 50 points of electricity damage from a single source (such as a trap or a spell), the wearer immediately benefits from the effects of time stop, and the electro-temporal bracer ceases functioning for 1 month.
