This is in addition to your bonus for Stern Gaze.\\n\\nTorturer's Touch (Sp): You may use touch of fatigue as a spell-like ability. Creatures that are immune to pain effects are immune to this touch. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.\\n\\nCritical Precision (Ex): At 8th level, when you roll a critical threat, you may expend one use of your torturer's touch ability to add +4 on your critical confirmation roll. This does not stack with Critical Focus.\\n\\n\\n\"\n",

The maximum damage for each spell remains unchanged.\\n\\nHallowed Rite (Su): At 8th level, you gain the ability to conduct a sacred funeral rite. This rite takes 1 day, during which you perform the necessary chants and prayers and burn incense. At the end of the rite you must oversee the burial of the corpse. The burial must take place within 24 hours of the preparation or the ritual fails. Once the body is interred, it cannot be turned into an undead creature, as if it were under the effect of a hallow spell (caster level equal to your inquisitor level).\\n\\n\\n\"\n",

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.\\n\\nGrasp of Honesty (Su): At 8th level, any creature you are grappling or pinning is affected by zone of truth (Will negates). Outside of combat, you may use this ability by touching a target with both hands. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your inquisitor level.

On your oath, you will deliver justice so unbounded.\\n\\nDivine Retribution (Sp): As a standard action, you can point at one creature within 30 feet to indicate that it is the target of divine wrath. A mishap or an accident appropriate to the environment occurs, such as a branch falling on the creature, rocks falling from the ceiling, or some other nonmagical misfortune; regardless of the cause, the mishap deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every two inquisitor levels you possess (Reflex half).

Effects that kill you or do not reduce you to negative hit points (such as ability damage or drain, negative levels, and disintegrate) do not trigger this ability.\\n\\n\\n\"\n",
