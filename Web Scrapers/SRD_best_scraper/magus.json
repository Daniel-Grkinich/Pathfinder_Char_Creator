  "Song of Arcane Triumph (Su)": {
    "Prerequisite": "Elf, half elf",
    "Benefit": "The mighty song of arcane triumph allows a magus to channel the raw energy of her magical power into her elven music. The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to sing a litany of triumph on a single successful hit. The opponent that his attack struck suffers 1d6 points of sonic per magus class level (maximum 20d6) in addition to normal damage. A Fortitude save (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier) halves the sonic damage this effect deals. On a critical hit, double this damage (unlike other bonus damage). Apply this extra damage even if the opponent is immune to critical hits. The Secrets of the Magus. Copyright 2011, Steven D. Russell. Author: Steven D. Russell."

The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to select a single opponent within her line of sight that can hear his words for 1 round per magus class level.

The target of this ability must make a Will save (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the maguss weapon forms a deadly link to the target. The magus sings of each of his attacks against the target before he completes it, but she exactly predicts the result of each stroke. Her target takes a 2 morale penalty to Armor Class on all attacks by the magus. In addition, the magus increases her critical threat range by one (do this before doubling the range due to the keen quality and other effects) against her target, and she deals an additional 1d6 points of sonic damage against the foe.
