    "Prerequisite": "Ronins resolve, barbarian level 10th. While raging, a barbarian with this rage power adds the exhausted, frightened, nauseated, and staggered conditions those which she can remove with the ronins resolve rage power. When she removes the fatigued or exhausted conditions, the barbarian can use her swift action on the same turn to make a single attack at her highest attack bonus against one creature she can reach. As a swift action while raging, a barbarian with this rage power can issue a challenge to one target within sight. If the target is able to reach and attack the barbarian on its next turn without putting itself directly in harms way, it must either do so or become demoralized as if the barbarian successfully intimidated it and beat the DC by 1d10 for every two ronins instinct rage powers the barbarian possesses."
