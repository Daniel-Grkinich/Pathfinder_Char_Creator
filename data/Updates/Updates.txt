Needs (High Prio):
- finish all classes on Pathfinder AON title 

- Create a function that randomly assigns a element to the Lore skill
- Need to add comment blocks to each function
- Monkey Goblin Broken
- Alchemist formulae sometimes Broken
- Redo Profession Chooser (the data section, we may want to just redo it from scratch)

- Created self.c_capped_level_1 and self.c_capped_level_2 variables to fix the spellcaster bug where being above level 20 -> errors and wouldn't rogue_talent_chooser
- Made it so Clerics pick favored spells (since they know all spells) to prepare based off of their spells per day
- Fixed a bug where divine casters couldn't get spells (because they don't have cantrips their i would keep getting 1 too high and try to read more than the len of the list)
- Similar bug with Alchemist (extra spells has some null values, we need to make them 0 otherwise the pgm doesn't run)
- wizard_schools (infernal binder) was missing the associated school section
