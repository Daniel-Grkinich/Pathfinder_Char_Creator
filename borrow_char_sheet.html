      If asked, Xavros will proudly declare that he was the natural leader of
      the PC party, and everyone naturally and almost instantly chose to look to
      him as their leader. After all, who wouldn’t look up to a wizard with,
      what some might argue, a questionable long amount of time spent in
      university? True, he had issues becoming the leader in any of the
      extracurricular activities he was in at the university, but everyone knew
      those were based on popularity contests rather than actual knowledge and
      skill at leadership. Eventually Xavros would prove himself and his
      abilities to the world, he just needed the right situation to present
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right situation did present itself three months ago after his favorite
      mentor mysteriously went missing, leaving only a torn journal of some of
      her notes behind. The other professors insisted - rather forcibly - that
      it was time for him to get out of the hallowed halls of academia and get
      some “practical” experience. Not sure why no one had his university seemed
      at all concerned about the disappearance of his mentor, Xavros swore to
      find out what happened to her and her research, and struck out to the east
      where he knew a tomb she had been looking for was said to have been
      located.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at a tavern, he overheard the bartender telling another employee
      about the unfortunate kidnapping of a village girl a few miles away rumors
      of a strange glow at an abandoned lighthouse. Remembering something his
      mentor had mentioned, Xavros wondered if this had something to do with one
      of the rumored summoning spells in the tomb his mentor had had been
      looking for. Knowing he did not have the physical power to take on the
      tower alone, he cleverly convinced two physical types, Thog and Horbin, to
      investigate the matter with him.
