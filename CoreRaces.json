      "Source": "Blood of Shadows pg. 5",
      "Physical Description": ": Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse—no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man.",
      "Society": ": The great distances between dwarves' mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves' fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not hesitate to adopt what they call \"aggressive negotiations.\"",
      "Relations": ": Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a history of violence as old as both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and halflings to be too frail, flighty, or \"pretty\" to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder—especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good.",
      "Adventurers": ": Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.",

        "Desert Dwarves": [
          "In southern peaks of the Shattered Range, near Geb and the Screaming Jungle, clans of nomadic dwarves live and travel through ancient tunnels by day, moving to the surface only at night. Though there are no known dwarven cities in this region, the Garundi dwarves claim the extensive tunnels and caverns they move through are the remains of a once=powerful dwarven kingdom, which was struck down by the gods for some long-forgotten offense. These dwarves travel in caravans of 40 or so family units (though the largest caravans can contain more than 300 families) and engage in sporadic clan-based trade or warfare, but they all respect the neutrality of hidden settlements of dwarves who dwell in underground oases within the mountains. Desert dwarves often have the craftsman, mountaineer, and rock stepper alternate racial traits. Most also have the desert delver alternate racial trait described below."

The Mbe’ke build cities in the mountains of the Terwa Uplands, while the Taralu live in small clans in the eastern jungle. Although there is little contact between the two groups, they share a reverence for and affinity with dragons—most especially cloud dragons— as well as any draconic creature that can be reasoned with, including wyverns. Mwangi dwarves often take the magic resistant or surface survivalist alternate racial traits.

They train themselves and others in the monastic city of Tar Kuata, constantly striving to put aside petty material concerns to focus on spiritual growth. The Ouat’s focus on the power of will and self-improvement causes many of them to take the relentless and stubborn alternate racial traits. Those who begin the path to inner awareness very early in their lives also sometimes take the iron within alternate racial trait described below."

In return, the Pahmet guard Erekrus, a necropolis in the mountains of southern Osirion, where the Pahmet interred the bodies of pharaohs deemed particularly worthy. The Pahmet are a rigid and often mistrusting people; it is common for its members who avoid contact with outsiders to have the xenophobic alternate racial trait.

Not quite a clan, the Paraheen are a set of related, family-run businesses respected for their great craftsmanship and work ethic. While most Paraheen are not citizens of Qadira, they are treated as a valued subclass of residents, with enough powerful patrons among the upper ranks of Qadiran society to afford them protection that in some cases is greater than citizenship. The Paraheen have operated as an autonomous community for centuries, avoiding local politics and worshiping a combination of traditional dwarven gods and an aspect of Sarenrae who is aligned with the fire of the forge. Nearly all Paraheen have the craftsman alternate racial trait, but in the case of the Paraheen, it replaces hardy rather than greed. Those Paraheen who are involved in trade by river and sea, common in Katheer, also generally have the saltbeard alternate racial trait.

          "When the dwarves successfully completed the Quest for Sky, they set about constructing 10 Sky Citadels, massive fortresses that formed the basis for dwarven kingdoms in the Inner Sea region. While several of those Sky Citadels have been lost or overrun, a few—such as Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Dongun Hold—remain bastions of dwarven tradition and authority. Because these Sky Citadels often have connections to the Darklands, it is common for the dwarves dwelling in their lower reaches to have the ancient enmity or deep warrior alternate racial traits, while those in lands populated by ogres and hill giants often have the giant hunter alternate racial trait, and those in wealthy areas that attract the attention of dragons sometimes have the sky sentinel or wyrmscourged alternate racial traits. Because of the eon-long histories of the Sky Citadels, their citizens also often have the deep tradition alternate racial trait described below."

      "Physical Description": ": Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of human populations. However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones.",
      "Society": ": Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Although, like most, elves prefer bountiful lands where resources are plentiful, when driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region's bounty, and learn how to maximize the benefit they receive from what little can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. While this can make them excellent guides to outsiders they befriend who must travel through such lands, their disdain of those who have not learned to live off the scant land as they have makes such friends rare.",
      "Relations": ": Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another race, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing the race as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn't understand why his \"special friend\" is upset the elf has noticed the friend is \"so much better than the rest of his kind.\" Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good, wishing all creatures to be safe and happy, but unwilling to sacrifice personal freedom or choice to accomplish such goals. serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking some base physical gratification.",
      "Adventurers": ": Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their ancestors. This need to see a wider world is accepted by their societies as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. Such elves are expected to return in some few decades and take up lives in their homelands once more, enriched both in treasure and in worldview.

      "Physical Description": ": Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Despite their small frames, however, gnomes are extremely resilient, and not as weak as many of their foes assume. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes much larger than themselves.",
      "Society": ": Unlike most races, gnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Gnome cities are unusual and gnome kingdoms almost unknown. Further, gnomes have no particular tendency to gather in specific neighborhoods even when a large number of them live among other races. While specific laws meant to contain the potential impact of gnomes on a society may require a \"gnome quarter,\" and societal pressure sometimes causes all non-gnomes to move away from areas with high gnome populations, left to their own devices, gnomes tend to spread evenly throughout communities that allow them.",
      "Relations": ": Gnomes have difficulty interacting with the other races, on both emotional and physical levels. In many ways the very fact other races see gnomes as odd is itself the thing gnomes find most odd about other races, and this leads to a strong lack of common ground upon which understanding and relationships can be built. When two gnomes encounter one another, they generally assume some mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, no matter how different their beliefs and traditions may be. Even if this turns out not to be the case, the gnomes continue to look for commonalities in their dealings with each other. The inability or unwillingness of members of other races to make the same effort when dealing with gnomes is both frustrating and confusing to most gnomes.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Although gnomes are impulsive tricksters, with sometimes inscrutable motives and equally confusing methods, their hearts are generally in the right place. What may seem a malicious act to a non-gnome is more likely an effort to introduce new acquaintances to new experiences, however unpleasant the experiences may be. Gnomes are prone to powerful fits of emotion, and find themselves most at peace within the natural world.",
      "Adventurers": ": Gnomes' propensity for wanderlust, deep curiosity, and desire to master odd or esoteric skills and languages make them natural adventurers. They often become wanderers to experience new aspects of life, for nothing is as novel as the uncounted dangers facing adventurers. Many gnomes see adventuring as the only worthwhile purpose in life, and seek out adventures for no other motive than to experience them. Other gnomes desire to find some lost lore or material that has ties to their chosen vocation and believe only dragon hoards and ancient ruins can contain the lore they need, which can result in gnomes who think of themselves as bakers or weavers being just as accomplished adventurers as those who declare themselves to be mages or scouts.",

      "Source": "Heroes of the Streets pg. 8",
      "Physical Description": ": Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be humanlike in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of drow descent, however. Such elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the human parent.",
      "Society": ": Their lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often considered attractive to both races for the same reasons as their parents, half-elves rarely fit in with either humans or elves, as both races see too much evidence of the other in them. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-elves are incredibly adaptable, capable of adjusting their mind-sets and talents to whatever societies they find themselves in.",
      "Relations": ": Half-elves understand loneliness, and know that character is often less a product of race than of life experience. As such, they are often open to friendships and alliances with other races, and less likely than most to rely on first impressions when forming opinions of new acquaintances.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Half-elves' isolation strongly influences their characters and philosophies. Cruelty does not come naturally to them, nor does blending in or bending to societal convention—as a result, most half-elves are chaotic good. Half-elves' lack of a unified culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do generally follow the common faiths of their homeland. Others come to religion and worship later in their lives, especially if they have been made to feel part of a community through faith or the work of clerical figures.",
      "Adventurers": ": Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering the lands in search of a place they might finally call home. The desire to prove themselves to the community and establish a personal identity—or even a legacy—drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery. Some half-elves claim that despite their longevity, they perceive the passage of time more like humans than elves, and are driven to amass wealth, power, or fame early on in life so they may spend the rest of their years enjoying it.",

These half-elves show their parentage on their faces, with sandy, russet, or green-black skin to match their elven parent. Slightly webbed fingers and toes aid in swimming, but their neck slits almost never function as gills. A few aquatic half-elves can breathe underwater and live with their elven parents, but far more shoreborn live on land, feeling a constant call to the water. Many find work as sailors. Fishing vessels and merchant ships often have shoreborn deckhands and first mates, and a crew made up solely of aquatic half-elves sails an infamous pirate ship known as the Shoreline Scourge."

          "The half-elves of the Mwangi Expanse have the dark skin of their Ekujae parents, but they tend to be closer in stature and build to their human parents, allowing wildborn to pass for human more easily than most of their fellow half-elves. These half-elves are equally at home in the wilds of the jungle or arranging trade deals in the larger Mwangi cities. While some Ekujae raise their wildborn children, others ritually turn over their half-elven offspring to specific half-elven villages within their Mwangi nation. The adult wildborn of these villages seek out and accept any of these children who might have fallen through the cracks, raising them with respect for both the wilderness and society. Even a few half-elves from other backgrounds travel to the Mwangi Expanse to join these villages, finding acceptance they can’t get anywhere else. The members of these villages protect their homes fiercely, and few dare attack them."

        "Elf-Raised": [
          "These half-elves represent those embraced by their elven relatives, and raised with all of the traditional cultural training and education typical of most full-blooded elves. These half-elves have the ancestral arms and arcane training alternate racial traits."

        "Half-Drow (Darkborn)": [
          "Scorned by both drow, who call them thinbloods, and humans, who call them darkborn, half-drow face discrimination and tribulation from an early age. Those half-drow who are not crushed by persecution are forced to age into particularly strong and independent adults. Some give into bitterness from their upbringing, becoming hardened assassins or wanton killers. Others deliberately rebel against their brutal childhoods, becoming righteous warriors against evil. Either way, half-drow fight fiercely to the very last. Darkborn have the gray skin and light-colored hair of the drow but have human-looking eyes, and they have a more difficult time appearing fully elven or human than most half-elves do."

Spireborn half-elves are almost always taken back to the Mordant Spire by their elven parent, and they are usually trained from youth to go on important missions outside of the Mordant Spire. Spireborn undergo both physical training and extensive education on the Azlanti. They tell no one they meet on their travels of their heritage or their top-secret duties."

        "Snowcaster Half-Elves (Snowborn)": [
          "Found throughout the northern countries, snowborn are typically the children of twilight speakers—religious envoys from the normally distrustful Snowcaster clans, who consider it a sacred duty to befriend humans and other non-elves. Snowcaster clans vary in their acceptance of these children, but the average clan’s seclusion from humanity and inability to understand half-elves almost invariably ends up driving the snowborn away. Twilight speakers, however, tend to enjoy a particularly close relationship with their snowborn children, and the two groups often wander together. Snowborn have their elven parents’ snowy white skin and particularly sharp ears. Some Snowcaster half-elves find welcome homes among the Jadwiga and Ulfen communities, as well as the Erutaki tribes. Others wander, looking for a permanent place to belong.While most think of people with one human and one elven parent when they think of half-elves, some half-elves are raised by two half-elven parents. Such half-elves feel less like outsiders, making them more confident, but less adaptable without the exposure to a human parent. They gain a +2 bonus to Charisma and one other ability score of their choice. This racial trait replaces the half-elf ’s usual racial ability score modifiers, as well as adaptability, elven immunities, keen senses, and multitalented.Some half-elves’ skepticism of apparent allies makes them cynical and stubborn. These half-elves gain a +2 racial bonus on saves against illusion spells and effects. Perception and Sense Motive are class skills for them. This racial trait replaces adaptability.,Some half-elves receive training in an unusual weapon. Half-elves with this racial trait receive Exotic Weapon Proficiency or Martial Weapon Proficiency with one weapon as a bonus feat at 1st level. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.Characters with this trait are at home in gloomy conditions. Whenever these characters benefit from concealment or full concealment due to darkness or dim light, they gain a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth checks.Dwarves can take this trait in place of the greed and stonecunning traits. Elves, gnomes, halflings, and half-orcs can take this trait in place of weapon familiarity. Half-elves can take this trait in place of adaptability. Humans can take this trait in place of the skilled trait, also gaining darkvision to a range of 60 feet.Darkborn (half-elves descended from drow) are proficient with the hand crossbow, rapier, and shortsword. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.,The mixed ancestry of some half-elves makes them resistant to mental attacks. Half-elves with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.,Many half-elves are skilled in the art of ingratiating themselves into a community as if they were natives. Half-elves with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Knowledge (local) checks. This racial trait replaces the adaptability racial trait.,Spireborn add +1 to the caster level of any transmutation spells they cast. Spireborn with a Charisma score of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—,,, and. The caster level for these effects is equal to the Spireborn’s character level.This replaces adaptability.Many half-elves find their way onto the water early in their youth, whether they live with trader families in or near Kyonin, work as smugglers around Lake Encarthan or the Inner Sea, or plunder alongside pirates. These half-elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Swim checks, as well as a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to move on narrow or slippery surfaces, and on Climb checks on docks and ships.

      "Source": "Blood of Shadows pg. 5",
      "Physical Description": ": Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet. They prefer to walk barefoot, leading the bottoms of their feet to become roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Their skin tends toward a rich cinnamon color and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling's ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human.",
      "Society": ": Rather than place their faith in empires or great causes, many halflings prefer to focus on the simpler and humbler virtues of their families and local communities. Halflings claim no cultural homeland and control no settlements larger than rural assemblies of free towns. Most often, they dwell at the knees of their human cousins in human cities, eking out livings as they can from the scraps of larger societies. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadow of their larger neighbors, while some prefer more nomadic lives, traveling the world and experiencing all it has to offer.",
      "Relations": ": A typical halfling prides himself on his ability to go unnoticed by other races—a trait that allows many halflings to excel at thievery and trickery. Most halflings know full well the stereotypical view other races take of them as a result, and go out of their way to be forthcoming and friendly to the bigger races when they're not trying to go unnoticed. They get along fairly well with gnomes, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings respect elves and dwarves, but these races often live in remote regions far from the comforts of civilization that halflings enjoy, thus limiting opportunities for interaction. By and large, only half-orcs are shunned by halflings, for their great size and violent natures are a bit too intimidating for most halflings to cope with.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Halflings are loyal to their friends and families, but since they dwell in a world dominated by races twice as large as themselves, they have come to grips with the fact that sometimes they need to scrape and scrounge for survival. Most halflings are neutral as a result. Though they usually make a show of respecting the laws and endorsing the prejudices of their communities, halflings place an even greater emphasis on the innate common sense of the individual. When a halfling disagrees with society at large, he will do what he thinks is best.",
      "Adventurers": ": Their inherent luck coupled with their insatiable wanderlust makes halflings ideal candidates for lives of adventure. Though perfectly willing to pocket any valuables they come across, halflings often care more for the new experiences adventuring brings them than for any material reward. Halflings tend to view money as a means of making their lives easier and more comfortable, not as an end in and of itself.",

        "Replaces Halfling Luck": [
          "Some halflings have greater control over their innate luck. This ability gives them more options for how they can apply their good fortune from day to day, but also narrows its scope. Three times per day, a halfling can gain a +2 luck bonus on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. If halflings choose to use the ability before they make the roll or check, they gain the full +2 bonus; if they choose to do so afterward, they only gain a +1 bonus. Using adaptive luck in this way is not an action. This racial trait replaces halfling luck.You lose the halfling luck racial trait (and its +1 racial bonus on saving throws) and instead gain the ability to curse another creature with bad luck at will as a standard action. This curse has a range of 30 feet, and you must be able to see the target and have line of effect to it. The target gets a Will saving throw to resist this jinx (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier). If your target makes this saving throw, it is immune to your jinx ability for 24 hours. A jinxed creature takes a –1 penalty on all saving throws. This jinx lasts for 24 hours or until you attempt to use your jinx again.

    "Half-Orc": {
      "Source": "Blood of Shadows pg. 5",
      "Physical Description": ": Half-orcs average around 6 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these \"tusks,\" combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, half-orcs are as varied as their human parents.",
      "Society": ": Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society's discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by humans who don't bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods. Even on the best of terms, half-orcs in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, orc leaders have been known to deliberately spawn half-orcs, as the halfbreeds make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural leaders and strategic advisors.",
      "Relations": ": Elves and dwarves tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a resemblance to their racial enemies, and other races aren't much more understanding.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Forced to live either among brutish orcs or as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter, violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but they are not evil by nature—rather, most half-orcs are chaotic neutral, having been taught by long experience that there's no point doing anything but that which directly benefits themselves. Half-orcs worship the human or orc gods venerated in the area where they were raised. Those who live alongside humans most often worship human gods of war, freedom, or destruction. Half-orcs raised in orc tribes find themselves most drawn to the gods of blood, fire, and iron—depending more on what god the tribe worships rather than the half-orcs' personal preference. Many half-orcs are contrary about religion, either ignoring it entirely, or getting deeply involved in it and trying to find meaning in a life filled with hate and misunderstanding; even a half-orc divine spellcaster may wrestle with doubt and anger about religion and faith.",
      "Adventurers": ": Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world.",
      "Male names": ": Ausk, Davor, Hakak, Kizziar, Makoa, Nesteruk, Tsadok.",

      "Orc Ferocity": ": Once per day, when a half-orc is brought below 0 hit points but not killed, he can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of his next turn, unless brought to 1 or more hit points, he immediately falls unconscious and begins dying.",
      "Weapon Familiarity": ": Half-orcs are proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the word \"orc\" in its name as a martial weapon.",

      "Subraces": {
        "Arena-Bred": [
          "Many half-orcs are born and raised to fight in the arena, and in many cases have two half-orc parents or even a half-orc and a human parent. These arena-bred half-orcs lose the brutal physical appearance of their orc ancestors and look more human. They have the city-raised and skilled alternate racial traits."
        ],
        "Darklands Half-Orcs (Gloomkin)": [
          "At the end of the Age of Darkness, when light returned to Golarion, many orcs lost their footholds on the surface world and returned to the Darklands, taking their half-orc progeny with them. Of all the half-orcs, gloomkin face the harshest treatment; they are punished and abused from birth for what orcs consider the taint of their bloodline. As the bottom of the social ladder in orc society, gloomkin are assigned the task that very few orcs take on willingly: reading. They are the historians, scribes, and advisors, placing them in a key position to discover secrets and gain influence without drawing attention to themselves."
        ],
        "Deep Kin": [
          "Some half-orcs are descended from clans that remained in the eternal darkness below the surface. Half-orcs from these clans tend to be smaller and more at home underground than those descended from surface-dwelling orcs. These half-orcs have the acute darkvision and cavewight alternate racial traits."
        ],
        "Desert Half-Orcs (Sandkin)": [
          "Desert half-orcs are born primarily in northern Garund and Osirion and often hold a level of esteem and self-assurance that is rare for half-orcs. Among desert orc tribes, the ability to tolerate harsh sunlight is a sign of strength, and weathering the sun is a rite of passage. Lacking their ancestors’ light sensitivity, half-orcs excel at these contests of endurance and easily earn high positions within their tribes.Desert half-orcs also fare better than most among human civilizations. The strong presence of Sarenrae’s followers has led to a culture of forgiveness and understanding that is rare in other parts of Golarion, making it easier for half-orcs to thrive. Many desert half-orcs believe they are blessed by Sarenrae and become clerics or paladins of her church."
        ],
        "Feral": [
          "Half-orc children who are abandoned as infants or small children rarely survive in the wild, but a few manage to scrape out a meager existence as \"wild children,\" tough enough to live but completely uncivilized. Feral half-orcs have the forest walker and toothy alternate racial traits."
        ],
        "Jungle Half-Orcs (Rainkin)": [
          "In the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the few remaining orc tribes have been largely cut off from others of their kind. Isolated since the orc empires collapsed after the Age of Darkness, only a handful of oral retellings recall the true heritage of these orcs and half-orcs, and their culture diverges greatly from other orc societies. It is said that some early Mwangi tribes participated in arranged marriages with orcs, leading half-orc children to be associated with alliances and prosperity, and true or not, half-orcs have been a major part of these orc tribes for generations. Even in the present day, many orcs are willing to pay a large dowry to bring half-orcs into their villages, and orphaned half-orcs are happily adopted.Because they usually come from rich families, rainkin halforcs often receive better treatment than their orc or human cousins. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy; because half-orc children receive the best care, protection, and training, they are usually stronger and more skilled than orcs or humans, increasing the desire to have half-orcs in a tribe. While jungle half-orcs typically have great pride and selfworth, many are also resentful of the high expectations placed on them from birth and angry to be treated like a commodity by so many. As a result, rainkin have trouble forming close bonds with non-half-orcs, so they often create close-knit groups between themselves. Some of these groups even grow large enough to break off and form their own tribes."
        ],
        "Mountain Clan": [
          "Half-orcs from the more mountainous regions tend to be more agile and alert to the echoing sounds of their homeland. Mountain clan half-orcs have the bestial and rock climber racial traits."
        ],
        "Mountain Half-Orcs (Cragkin)": [
          "Cragkin are widespread across Golarion, found across all the mountain ranges of western Avistan. Thanks to their thin frames and quick wits, mountain-born half-orcs excel at climbing and acrobatic stunts. Anything less than a vertical cliff face is traversable, and often even that isn’t enough to stop them. To mountain half-orcs, obstacles are merely a foothold on their path to the top.Mountain orcs respect bravery, and cragkin have turned fearlessness and reckless abandon into a badge of honor. By using the terrain to their advantage against less surefooted enemies, they can attack from strange angles and gain advantages with just a few quick steps. They often take near-suicidal leaps to strike enemies from above, or trick enemies into falling to their deaths by leading them down impossible paths. Despite their great skill, accidents are common in this treacherous environment, and no one is surprised if one halforc returns after a raid and his companions do not.Many mountain half-orcs find a place among Shoanti and Ulfen settlements, where valor in battle is highly prized. As long as they are willing to respect the traditions of their adopted clans, they usually integrate well into these societies and contribute much to the community."
        ],
        "Mystic": [
          "Orc shamans are brutal teachers who sometimes kill or maim their most promising students in order to eliminate what could be a potential rival. Half-orcs who survive years of abuse by an orc shaman master are deeply scarred and altered by the experience. Shaman trainees learn early that cunning and luck are often the only things that offer a chance of survival. They have the shaman’s apprentice and sacred tattoo alternate racial traits."
        ],
        "Winter Half-Orcs (Frostkin)": [
          "At the Crown of the World, nomadic clans of orcs live on the frozen wastes. The winter half-orcs that live among them are treated as the runts of the pack. However, strength in numbers is vital in the north, as many young do not survive the harsh winters. Even the weakest are provided for as long as they can prove their usefulness. Sewing, cooking, and child-rearing are all valued skills, and winter half-orcs who excel at these are treated better than most. Those who would rather prove their worth through their strength do so by hunting, as ritual combat is a frowned upon waste of energy and resources.While half-orcs are not well liked in the Linnorm Kingdoms, they may be able to find homes in the Ironbound Isles. Merchants traveling between Tian Xia and Avistan are often willing to hire on a half-orc as a guide and bodyguard across the Crown of the World.

    "Human": {
      "Source": "Inner Sea Races pg. 214",
      "Physical Description": ": The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the world's climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the northern lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, humans' skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the equator they live. At the same time, bone structure, hair color and texture, eye color, and a host of facial and bodily phenotypic characteristics vary immensely from one locale to another. Cheekbones may be high or broad, noses aquiline or flat, and lips full or thin; eyes range wildly in hue, some deep set in their sockets, and others with full epicanthic folds. Appearance is hardly random, of course, and familial, tribal, or national commonalities often allow the knowledgeable to identify a human's place of origin on sight, or at least to hazard a good guess. Humans' origins are also indicated through their traditional styles of bodily decoration, not only in the clothing or jewelry worn, but also in elaborate hairstyles, piercing, tattooing, and even scarification.",
      "Society": ": Human society comprises a multitude of governments, attitudes, and lifestyles. Though the oldest human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of other races like elves and dwarves, human society seems to be in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old. In general, humans are known for their flexibility, ingenuity, and ambition. Other races sometimes envy humans their seemingly limitless adaptability, not so much biologically speaking but in their willingness to step beyond the known and press on to whatever might await them. While many or even most humans as individuals are content to stay within their comfortable routine, there is a dauntless spirit of discovery endemic to humans as a species that drives them in striving toward possibilities beyond every horizon.",
      "Relations": ": Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often spur them into contact with other races during bouts of territorial expansion and colonization. In many cases, this tendency leads to violence and war, yet humans are also swift to forgive and forge alliances with races who do not try to match or exceed them in violence. Proud, sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans might look upon dwarves as miserly drunkards, elves as flighty fops, halflings as craven thieves, gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves and half-orcs as embarrassments—but the race's diversity among its own members also makes many humans quite adept at accepting others for what they are. Humans may become so absorbed in their own affairs that they remain ignorant of the language and culture of others, and some take this ignorance to a hateful extreme of intolerance, oppression, and rarely even extermination of others they perceive as dangerous, strange, or \"impure.\" Thankfully, while such incidents and movements may taint all of humanity in the eyes of some, they are more often the exception than the rule.",
      "Alignment and Religion": ": Humanity is perhaps the most diverse of all the common races, with a capacity for both great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast barbaric hordes, while others build sprawling cities that cover miles.
