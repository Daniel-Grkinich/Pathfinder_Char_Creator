When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves."

Axe-gauntlets were developed during the long Quest for Sky, when dwarven warriors often had to engage in running fights against larger, stronger opponents in areas the dwarves did not intend to ever return to. Losing a weapon in such circumstances often made it irretrievable, and the axe-gauntlet became popular with rearguard warriors. Though these weapons have seen significantly less use since the dwarves reached the surface, some dwarven warriors still appreciate the reliability of such designs. An axe-gauntlet takes a full-round action to don, and it gives you a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts. You can't use the hand on which an axe-gauntlet is worn for anything else."

A barbazu beard can be used as an off-hand weapon that requires no hands to use; thus, a warrior could combine use of a barbazu beard with a two-handed weapon. It otherwise follows all rules for using an off-hand weapon. Attacking with a barbazu beard provokes an attack of opportunity. Because it is so close to the wearer's face, using a barbazu beard against creatures harmful to touch (such as fire elementals and acidic oozes) has the same risks as using a natural weapon or unarmed strike against these creatures.

      "weapon groups": "Crossbows Description The dwarven pelletbow is a crossbowlike weapon that is loaded with and fires sling bullets rather than bolts. A dwarven heavy pelletbow takes the same amount of time and effort to load as a light crossbow (normally a move action), and a dwarven light pelletbow can be reloaded as a free action (allowing characters to attack with it multiple times in a round). Normally a pelletbow takes two hands to operate, but you can shoot (but not load) a pelletbow with one hand by taking a 2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot one pelletbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls for attacking with two weapons (treating the heavy pelletbow as a one-handed weapon and the light pelletbow as a light weapon). Feats and special abilities that don't involve proficiency (that don't depend on dealing piercing damage or firing bolts) that apply to a heavy crossbow also apply to a dwarven heavy pelletbow, and those that apply to a light crossbow also apply to a dwarven light pelletbow."
